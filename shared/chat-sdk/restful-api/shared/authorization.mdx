Chat RESTful APIs require Bearer HTTP authentication. Every time an HTTP request is sent, the following `Authorization` field must be filled in the request header:

```html
Authorization: Bearer ${YourAppToken}
```

In order to improve the security of the project, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> uses a token (dynamic key) to authenticate users before they log in to the chat system. Chat RESTful APIs only support authenticating users using app tokens. For details, see [Authentication using App Token](/agora-chat/develop/authentication).
