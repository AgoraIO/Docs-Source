Since Apple does not support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream. You use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the main process.

    ![Screen Sharing iOS Tech](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-ios-tech.svg)

Take the following steps to set up your <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> project:

1. Go to your project folder and open the `.xcodeproj` file with Xcode.
1. Navigate to **File > New > Target...**, select **Broadcast Upload Extension** in the popup window, and then click **Next**:

    ![Select Broadcast Upload Extension](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-ios-select-broadcast-upload-extension.png)

1. Fill in the **Product Name** and other information in the popup window, uncheck **Include UI Extension**, and click **Finish**. Xcode automatically creates a folder for the extension that contains the `SampleHandler.swift` files.
1. Under **Target**, select the newly created extension. Click **General** and set the iOS version to 12.0 or later under **Deployment Info**.

1. Modify project settings to implement the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> code logic, and choose one of the following three methods according to your business needs:

    - If you only need to use the functionality in the `AgoraReplayKitExtension.xcframework` dynamic library provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, select **Target** as the extension you just created, and change the **Value** in **Info** corresponding to **NSExtension > NSExtensionPrincipalClass** from **SampleHandler** to **AgoraReplayKitHandler**:

    - If you need to implement some additional business logic, you can inherit the `AgoraReplayKitHandler` class. Modify the `SampleHandler.swift` file as follows:

            ``` swift
            import ReplayKit
            import AgoraReplayKitExtension

            class SampleHandler: AgoraReplayKitHandler {
                override func broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo setupInfo: [String : NSObject]?) {
                    // User request to start broadcasting
                    super.broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo: setupInfo)
                }
            }
            ```

    - If you want to use the iOS native **SampleHandler** without inheriting the `AgoraReplayKitHandler` class, refer to the following code to modify the `SampleHandler.swift` file:

            ``` swift
            import ReplayKit
            import AgoraReplayKitExtension

            class SampleHandler: RPBroadcastSampleHandler, AgoraReplayKitExtDelegate {
                override func broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo setupInfo: [String : NSObject]?) {
                    // User request to start broadcasting
                    AgoraReplayKitExt.shareInstance().start(self)
                }
                override func broadcastPaused() {
                    // User request to pause the broadcast
                    AgoraReplayKitExt.shareInstance().pause()
                }

                override func broadcastResumed() {
                    // User request to resume broadcasting
                    AgoraReplayKitExt.shareInstance().resume()
                }

                override func broadcastFinished() {
                    // User request to stop broadcasting
                    AgoraReplayKitExt.shareInstance().stop()
                }

                override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
                    AgoraReplayKitExt.shareInstance().push(sampleBuffer, with: sampleBufferType)
                }

                func broadcastFinished(_ broadcast: AgoraReplayKitExt, reason: AgoraReplayKitExtReason) {
                    var tip = ""
                    switch reason {
                    case AgoraReplayKitExtReasonInitiativeStop:
                        tip = "AgoraReplayKitExtReasonInitiativeStop"

                    case AgoraReplayKitExtReasonConnectFail:
                        tip = "AgoraReplayKitExReasonConnectFail"

                    case AgoraReplayKitExtReasonDisconnect:
                        tip = "AgoraReplayKitExReasonDisconnect"

                    default: break
                    }

                    let error = NSError(domain: NSCocoaErrorDomain,
                                        code: 0,
                                        userInfo: [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey: tip])
                    self .finishBroadcastWithError(error as Error)
                }
            }
            ```

### Automatically integrate dynamic libraries

When integrating the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="VSDK" /> through CocoaPods, you need to add the following content in the `Podfile` file to specify the integration of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> dynamic library `AgoraReplayKitExtension.xcframework`. Refer to the following sample code:

```shell
platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'Your App' do
# Integration of only base libraries and screen sharing dynamic libraries
# Please replace x.y.z in the following code with the specific SDK version number. 
# You can get the latest version number from the release notes.
pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', 'x.y.z', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic', 'ReplayKit']
end
```

The <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> dynamic library encapsulates screen recording with Apple **ReplayKit**. Use the SDK capture function to get system recording data and send it to other users in the channel.
