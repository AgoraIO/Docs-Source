Agora <Vg k="SIG" />  provides low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and synchronization capabilities for
real-time systems. This page shows you how to easily integrate <Vg k="SIG" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg
k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

Rewrite

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

<GetStartedSDK  product="Signaling" company="Agora" sdk="Signaling SDK" client="app" />


## Next steps

Generating a token manually is not a practical solution in a production context. [Secure authentication with tokens](../develop/authentication-workflow) shows you how to use Signaling with a token that you retrieve from your server.
