## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> into your Electron project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, download and use the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13) on GitHub to integrate <Vg k="FC"/>.

### Use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>

To integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through CDN if you're satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, follow this integration method. You must have an existing Electron project using an Electron version higher than 12.0.0 to use this method.

1. Add the following code to the Electron entry file:

    ```javascript
    const electron = require('electron');
    app.allowRendererProcessReuse = false;
    ```

2. When creating a `BrowserWindow` object, pass in the following parameters:

    ```javascript
    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
      ...
      webPreferences: {
        ...
        autoplayPolicy: "no-user-gesture-required",
        nodeIntegration: true,
        contextIsolation: false,
        webSecurity: false,
        webviewTag: true,
        enableRemoteModule: true,
        nativeWindowOpen: true,
        backgroundThrottling: false
      }
    });
    ```

3. Add the following dependencies and configurations to `package.json`:

    ```json
    "agora_electron": {
      "electron_version": "12.0.0",
      "prebuilt": true
    },
    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "agora-electron-sdk": "3.5.1-build.1116",
    }
    ```

4. Import the Agora Classroom SDK in the HTML file and launch a classroom:

    ```html
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.8.13.bundle.js"></script>
    <style> #root { width: 100%; height: 100%; } </style>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Configure the SDK.
      // Provide your App ID.
      AgoraEduSDK.config({
        appId: 'Your App ID',
        region: 'NA'
      });
      // Launches the Flexible Classroom.
      AgoraEduSDK.launch(document.querySelector('#root'), {
        userUuid: 'user id',
        userName: 'user name',
        roomUuid: 'room id',
        roleType: 1, // Role type: 1 for teachers, 2 for students.
        roomType: 0, // Room type: 0 for a one-to-one classroom, 2 for a lecture hall (a common lecture hall or a vocational lecture hall depending on room sub-type), 4 for a small classroom.
        roomSubType: 0, // Room sub-type. The default value is 0. To set a vocational lecture hall, set roomType as 2 and roomSubType as 1.
        roomName: 'room name',
        pretest: true, // Whether to enable the pre-class device test.
        rtmToken: 'rtm token', // In a test environment, you can use a temporary token; in a production or security environment, Agora strongly recommends that you use a server-generated token.
        language: 'en', // The language on the classroom UI: zh for Chinese and en for English.
        duration: 60 * 30, // The duration of the class (in seconds).
        recordUrl: 'https://solutions-apaas.agora.io/apaas/record/dev/2.3.3/record_page.html',
        courseWareList: [],
        uiMode: 'light', // The theme of the classroom UI: light for the light mode,dark for the dark mode.
        listener: (evt, args) => {},
      }).then(() => {
        console.log('start launch');
      }).catch((e) => {
        console.error('fail to launch', e);
      });
    </script>
    ```

    The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what is a <Vg k="MESS" /> token, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purpose, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:

<div class="alert info">Make sure you have <a href="../get-started/#set-up-the-development-environment">set up the development environment</a>.</div>

1. To clone the Flexible-Classroom-Desktop repository and check out the latest release branch, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop.git
   cd flexible-classroom-desktop
   ```

1. Switch to the latest branch.

    For example, if you want to switch to the branch of v2.8.13, just run the following command:

    ```bash
    git checkout release/2.8.13
    ```

   Agora recommends switching the branch to the latest release.

1. To create an environment variable configuration file, take the following steps:

    1. Execute the following command to copy the `.env.example` file in your project's root directory to `packages/agora-classroom-sdk` and rename the file as `.env`.

        ```bash
        cp .env.example packages/agora-classroom-sdk/.env
        ```

    1. Fill in your App ID and App Certificate in the `packages/agora-classroom-sdk/.env` file as follows:

        ```
        REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID={your appid}
        REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE={your app certificate}
        ```

1. After pulling the code to your local device, you are free to edit the code according to your needs. You can refer to the [Customize the Classroom UI guide](../develop/customize-ui).

1. After finishing the development, follow these steps to debug:

    1. To install dependencies, run the following commands:

        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

        ```bash
        yarn bootstrap
        ```

    2. To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

        ```bash
        yarn dev:electron
        ```

1. After finishing the development, pack the SDK or app with the following commands:

    - To pack the Electron macOS client:

        ```bash
        yarn build:demo
        yarn pack:electron:mac
        ```

    - To pack the Electron Windows client:

        ```bash
        yarn build:demo
        yarn pack:electron:win
        ```
