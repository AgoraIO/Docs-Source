App developers spent a lot of time selecting, integrating, and testing different combinations of SDKs in order to ensure call quality and effects. Every step slowed down the process of app delivery. Now, the Extensions Marketplace does all the heavy lifting for you! It helps developers shorten the integration time and enables them to concentrate on business logic and user experience.

Becoming a vendor lets you encapsulate interactive features into extensions, reach more customers, and build a powerful ecosystem together with Agora. The Extensions Marketplace has attracted top technology providers such as Bose and VoiceMod, forming a vibrant extension ecosystem. Significant effects have been achieved in beauty camera, noise cancellation, voice changer, and background remover use cases. The Extensions Marketplace helps developers shorten the integration time rapidly. You also use Agora's Extensions Marketplace to increase revenue. If you have created a cool effect using Agora SDKs, bundle it up as an extension and sell it on the marketplace.

The Extensions Marketplace increases your productivity and your revenue. Kick back and relax, Agora enables you to make more money with less work.


## About the Extensions Marketplace

The Agora Extensions Marketplace has two types of participants:

- Vendors: Third-party service providers who offer features such as voice effects, noise cancellation, and face filters in the form of extensions.
- Developers: App developers who want to add fun features to real-time communication apps powered by the Agora SDK.

### How do vendors build extensions?

To build an extension, vendors need to implement a set of APIs:

- Extension APIs: Implement the core functionality of the extension through audio and video filters. Learn more about [Develop your extension](./vendor_join#step-2-develop-your-extension).
- Provisioning API: Share provisioning information between vendors and Agora. Learn more about the [Provisioning APIs](./provisioning).
- Billing and Usage API: Share billing and usage information between vendors and Agora. Learn more about the [Usage and Billing APIs](./usage).

### How do developers get extensions?

Developers work with extensions as follows:
1. [Activate an extension](https://docs.agora.io/en/extension_customer/get_extension?platform=All%20Platforms) on Agora Console
2. Implement the extension in their apps
	Each extension has its own implementation guides. Implementation guides are provided by the vendor, validated by Agora, and published with the extension on Agora Console.

### Platform support

The Agora Extensions Marketplace provides support for multiple platforms. An extension is used together with the Agora SDK corresponding to the platform. See the table below:

| Platform                                         | Required SDK           | Required SDK version          | SDK advantages                                            |
