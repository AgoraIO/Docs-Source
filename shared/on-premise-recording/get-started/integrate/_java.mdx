This page shows how to set up the environment to integrate the Agora On-Premise Recording SDK.

The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK for Linux is integrated on your Linux server instead of in your app.

Recording audio and video within a channel is like a special audience joining the channel. The audience gets the audio and video from the channel, transcodes it, and stores it on a Linux server. Therefore, you must integrate the On-Premise Recording SDK on your Linux server. The same App ID is used in the On-Premise Recording SDK and the Agora SDK for audio and video calls.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware and network requirements

The following table lists the basic requirements for installing the On-Premise Recording SDK:

| Hardware or Network | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Server | Physical or virtual. |
| System | Ubuntu 14.04+ x64 or CentOS 6.5+ (7.0 recommended) x64. |
| Network | The Linux server needs Internet access. |
| Internet Bandwidth | Use an Internet bandwidth based on the number of channels being recorded simultaneously. Refer to the following data: <ul><li>When the resolution of the recorded scene is 640 x 360, the bandwidth is 500 Kbps.</li><li>To record a channel with two users, you need a bandwidth of 1 Mbps.</li><li>To record 100 channels, you need a bandwidth of 100 Mbps.</li></ul>For detailed bandwidth data, see <Link to= "{{global.OPREC_SDK_API_JAVA}}/interfaces/index.html">Recording API</Link>. |

### Cloud Hosting Configuration

We conduct tests on the recording concurrency based on the following cloud hosting configuration:

* AWS: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8124M CPU @ 3.00 GHz
* 16 Virtual Core CPU, 32 GB RAM
* Disk I/O: 412 MB/s

Test conditions:

* Each channel has two users/hosts. The resolution and frame rate of each channel are set as 320 × 240 and 15 fps respectively.
* The resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the recorded files in composite recording mode are set as 640 × 480, 15 fps, and 500 Kbps respectively; and the audio bitrate of the recorded files in composite recording mode is set as 48 Kbps.

Test results:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Channel Profile</th>
    <th>Recording Mode</th>
    <th>Performance</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">Live Broadcast</td>
    <td>Audio + Video<p>Individual recording</p></td>
    <td>When recording 215 channels simultaneously, the CPU usage is about 75%.<p>We recommend recording 200 channels simultaneously.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Audio + Video<p>Composite recording</p></td>
    <td>When recording 70 channels simultaneously, the CPU usage is about 75%.<p>We recommend recording 60 channels simultaneously.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Audio only<p>Composite recording</p></td>
    <td>When recording 300 channels simultaneously, the CPU usage is about 75%.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Communication</td>
    <td>Audio + Video<p>Individual recording</p></td>
    <td>When recording 210 channels simultaneously, the CPU usage is about 75%.<p>We recommend recording 200 channels simultaneously.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Audio + Video<p>Composite recording</p></td>
    <td>When recording 60 channels simultaneously, the CPU usage is about 75%.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The test results are for reference purposes only. Set up your own cloud hosting according to your recording requirement.

## Set up the environment

Set up the environment on your Linux server:
1. [Download](http://docs.agora.io/en/sdks) the Agora On-Premise Recording SDK for Linux package. The package structure is listed as follows:

  | Folder | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | bin | The directory where AgoraCoreService is located. |
  | include | <li>base: Required header files for developing the recording application.</li><li>IAgoraLinuxSdkCommon.h: Public structure and enumeration.</li><li>IAgoraRecordingEngine.h: Interface of the recording engine and its configuration.</li> |
  | libs | Required libraries for developing the recording application. |
  | samples | Sample code: <ul><li>agorasdk: Demo that implements the C++ interface and callbacks.</li><li>base: Public sample code.</li><li>cpp: C++ sample code.<ul><li>release/bin/recorder: Parent process that can be run.</li></ul></li><li>java: Java sample code.<ul><li>native: Native code.</li><li>native/jni: JNI delegate.</li><li>src: Java code.</li><li>src/io/agora/recording/RecordingEventHandler.java: Callback interface class.</li><li>src/io/agora/recording/RecordingSDK.java: Recording interface class.</li></ul></li></ul> |
  | Tools | Transcoding tools. |

2. Ensure that your compiler is GCC 4.4+.
3. Set up the Java Development Kit and ensure **jni.h** is included.
4. Set `CLASSPATH` in Java and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Linux.
5. If your firewall restricts access to the Agora services, use [cloud proxy service](../develop/cloud-proxy).

6. Open the UDP ports used by the recording processes. The UDP ports are the ports between the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters specified in `RecordingConfig`.

   > - Use the `iptables -L` command line to check the UDP port.
   > - To record the content in the channels, you need one recording process for each of the channels. One recording process requires four UDP ports. There must be no port conflict among the processes, including the system processes and all recording processes.
   > - We recommend that you specify the range of ports used by the recording processes. Configure a large range for all recording processes \(Agora recommends 40000 to 41000 or larger\). If so, the On-Premise Recording SDK assigns ports to each recording process within the specified range and avoids port conflicts automatically. To set the port range, you need to configure the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters.
   > - If the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters are not specified, the ports used by the recording processes are at random, which may cause port conflicts.


7. For debugging purposes, we recommend that you enable core dump on your Linux system.


## Compile the sample code

1. Run the following command to pre-set the environment under the **samples/java** directory. Replace **jni_path** with the absolute path of the **jni.h** file. For example, **/usr/java8u161/jdk1.8.0_161/include/**：

   ```
   source build.sh pre_set jni_path
   ```

2. Execute the build script under the **samples/java** directory:

   ```
   ./build.sh build
   ```

After the compilation, a **librecording.so** file is generated in the **samples/java/bin/io/agora/recording** directory, as shown in the following figure.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1544522310646)

Now you can use the demo to start recording by command line, see [Record a Call](record-cmd). If you want to call APIs, you need to import the SDK files to your project.

## Import files

Import the following files to your project:

-  `librecording.so`
-  `AgoraCoreService`  in the **bin** folder
- All the Java files under **samples/java/src/io/agora/recording**
  - `RecordingEventHandler.java`
  - `RecordingSDK.java`
  - `/common/Common.java`
  - `/common/RecordingConfig.java`
  - `/common/RecordingEngineProperties.java`

For example, if the project root directory is  `ROOT_DIR`, you need to copy the `librecording.so` file to  `ROOT_DIR/lib`, copy the `AgoraCoreService` file to `ROOT_DIR/bin`, and copy the Java files to `ROOT_DIR/src/io/agora/recording`.

When running the Java project, set `-Djava.library.path=ROOT_DIR/lib`to specify the path to the dynamic library. Note that you need to set the `appliteDir` parameter as `ROOT_DIR/bin` in `RecordingConfig` when starting a recording.

The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK is integrated. You can start recording by calling APIs, see <Link to= "{{global.OPREC_SDK_API_JAVA}}/interfaces/index.html">Recording API</Link>.
