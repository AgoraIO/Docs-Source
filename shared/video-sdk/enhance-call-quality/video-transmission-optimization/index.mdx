<Vg k="COMPANY"/> prioritizes both clarity and smoothness in video experience. However, this can be challenging in weak network conditions, often requiring a trade-off. Scenarios and products have unique requirements; for instance, screen sharing prioritizes clarity, while casual video calls prioritize smoothness. The <Vg k="VSDK"/> offers a transmission optimization feature to address these needs.

## Understand the tech

To optimize the video transmission, the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="VSDK"/> offers two transmission optimization strategies for local video tracks:

**Clear Priority**: 

This strategy prioritizes clarity by automatically setting a minimum bit rate based on the capture resolution and frame rate. Even during network fluctuations, the sending bit rate will not drop below this threshold, ensuring a clear video picture. In most cases, the SDK will maintain the send resolution, although it may reduce the frame rate if necessary.

**Smoothness First**: 

In this approach, smoothness takes precedence over clarity. The SDK does not enforce a minimum bit rate policy, allowing the sending end to dynamically adjust the bit rate in response to network fluctuations. This ensures that the receiving end's video picture remains uninterrupted or free from freezing. Typically, the SDK will maintain the frame rate, but it may reduce the send resolution if needed.
These strategies provide users with flexibility to prioritize either clarity or smoothness based on their specific use cases and network conditions
