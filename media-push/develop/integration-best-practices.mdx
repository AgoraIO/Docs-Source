To ensure reliability of Media Push, Agora recommends that you follow the advice on this page when integrating Media Push RESTful APIs.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to start using Media Push RESTful API:

- The scene of the channel is live, profile set to `BROADCASTING`
- Media Push is enabled
- Message Notification Service is enabled to monitor Media Push events

## Limitations

### QPS

The Agora server limits the number of queries per second (QPS) to the Media Push RESTful API.
When the QPS is exceeded, the status code `429` (Too Many Requests)
is returned. If you need a higher QPS limit, contact technical support.


|API   |QPS limit                                             |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Create    |Creating a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Delete    |Deleting a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Update    |Updating a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Get       |Getting the request rate of a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|

### Maximum number of concurrent tasks

The default maximum number of concurrent tasks is 300, which indicates
that a maximum of 300 media push tasks can be run simultaneously in one
project. If a higher quota is required, contact technical support.

## Ensure the high availability of REST services

To ensure the high availability of REST services and prevent downtime caused by regional network faults, Agora provides
failover and domain name switch.

### Failover

Network failures and risks may be caused by cloud and network software, infrastructure, and other factors that Agora cannot control.
To provide the best possible user experience, Media Push provides high availability automatic task migration for failure recovery.
After a failure is confirmed, the media push task is migrated within 120 seconds. During this period, the task may be interrupted.

Consider whether you can accept the impact of high availability migration based on your own business characteristics,
and decide whether to adopt higher quality assurance measures. For example, create multiple media push tasks for critical
scenes. Alternatively, you can make periodic API calls and monitor notifications to get the latest
task status, then create a new task with a different UID once you confirm the task status is unhealthy.

### Multiple media push tasks

If you need a more reliable solution than fault recovery, you can use a multiple media push task strategy. You can choose
the following two ways to implement it:

1.  Start the main push task and multiple backup tasks at the same time.
    Set a different CDN address for each media push task. When the main
    media push task fails, the CDN audience can switch to the backup CDN
    address in time.

2.  If the CDN vendor you use supports the feature of pushing several
    streams to the same CDN address with different priorities,
    create a media push task No. 1 to the CDN with priority 1
    (`<rtmp://xxx/xxx/xxx>? priority=1`). If task 1 fails, create
    task 2 with priority is 2. In this case, task 1 is ignored by the CDN.
    The priority fields of different CDNs are different. Check with the CDN vendor
    whether the priority function is supported and what the name of the
    priority field is.

### Switch domain name

Take the following steps to switch a domain name:

1. Set the primary domain name based on the location of your service
server:
-   If the DNS address of the service server is in mainland China, set
    the primary domain name to `api.sd-rtn.com`.
-   If the DNS address of the service server is located in a country or
    region other than mainland China, set the primary domain name to
    `api.agora.io`.
2. If the primary domain name fails to initiate a RESTful API request,
use the primary domain name to retry.

3. If the retry in step 2 still fails, use the alternate domain
name to retry.

-   If the current primary domain name is `api.sd-rtn.com`, the alternate
    domain name is `api.agora.io`.
-   If the current primary domain name is `api.agora.io`, the alternate
    domain name is `api.sd-rtn.com`.

4. If the retry in step 3 still fails, use the domain name adjacent to
the current region to retry.

For example, suppose your business server is located in Europe. You set the primary domain name to `api.agora.io`, and
the business server resolves the primary domain name to Germany. Germany is located in Central Europe (`api-eu-central-1.agora.io`).
Check the domain name table below - the adjacent area is West Europe (`api-eu-west-1.agora.io` or `api-eu-west-1.sd-rtn.com`).

Therefore, if the network is faulty and the retry in steps 2 and 3 fails, use the `api-eu-west-1.agora.io` or `api-eu-west-1.sd-rtn.com`
domain name to retry.

Note:

- To avoid exceeding the QPS limit with retry requests, Agora recommends that you use a retreat strategy for retries: first retry after 1 second,
then 3 seconds, then 6 seconds.
- If the request fails because of a network problem rather than a DNS domain name resolution problem, skip step 3 and proceed to step 4.
- Before switching to the region domain name, ensure that the REST services you use, for example, cloud recording or channel management, are deployed in that region.

## Create RTMP Converter

When creating a converter with a `create` call, pay attention to the following:

- Create the converter by region parameter:
    - The region you set must be in the same area as your CDN origin station. For example, if your CDN origin is located in US,
    set region to `na`.
    - Pass the region value in lowercase.
- Agora recommends that you assign a value to the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header.
The Agora server returns an `X-Custom-request-ID` field in the response header for troubleshooting purposes.
- Set UID or account as the user name for the converter. Do not set these two fields at the same time. Ensure that each
converter has a unique user name within the channel.
- To avoid repeated media streaming due to repeated creation of multiple converters, it is recommended to use the name field to
manage converters under a specific project:
    - At the same time, converters with the same names cannot exist in a
    project. If you attempt to create a converter with the same name, you will receive the `409` (Conflict) status code.
-   Agora recommends that you assign the name using a combination of the channel name and a converter property. For example,
`show68_horizontal` and `show68_vertical` would represent a horizontal and a vertical layout respectively.
-   `audioOption` and `videoOptions` are set as follows for audio only or video only scenarios:
    - In a video only scenario, you do not need to set `audioOptions` and its related fields.
    - In a audio only scenario, you do not need to set `videoOptions` and their related fields.
    - In audio plus video scenarios, `videoOptions` and `audioOptions` are required and cannot be left blank.
    > blank.
-   Set an appropriate value for `idleTimeout`. The default value of 300 seconds is recommended. It means that the converter
will automatically destroy 300 seconds after all the subscribed leave the channel.

## Update RTMP converter

When updating a specified converter with an `Update` call, pay attention
to the following:

When you use the query parameter sequence to update the same converter
multiple times, ensure that the sequence value increases. Media Push updates the converter
according to the latest update request, that is, the maximum sequence number.

Update API does not support the following configuration of the update `Converter:name`

- `idleTimeOut`
- `transcodeOptions.rtcChannel`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.codecProfile`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.sampleRate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.bitrate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.audioChannels`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codec`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codecProfile`

## Troubleshooting and recommended measures

### Retry with retreat strategy

If you receive `404`, `429`, or `5xx` error codes, take an escape strategy. For example, wait 5-6 seconds, 10-11 seconds,
or 15-16 seconds and try again. If you receive `404` and `5xx` three times in a row or if the `state` field in the body of the
response to querying the push status is `failed`, then the media push task has failed. Perform the following steps to rectify the fault:

1.  Check whether the CDN address is correct.

2.  If the CDN address is correct, destroy the current converter and create a new one.

### Troubleshooting by error code

- If the status code is 200, the request is successful.
- If the status code is not `200`, the request has failed. See the error message in the response body for clarification.

|Status code               |Possible error message |Possible reason of failure |Measures to take|
|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:--------|:----------|
|`400` Bad Request         |Invalid parameter: `rtmpUrl`. Replace and retry. Invalid parameter: `idleTimeout`. Replace and retry.	|Wrong parameters. Check by referring to the `reason` field in the HTTP response body.|
|`401` Unauthorized        |Invalid authentication credentials.	|RESTful API authentication failed.	|See [RESTful Authentication](../reference/restful-authentication)|
|`403` Forbidden           |No valid permission to use this function. Contact us.	|Service is not enabled.	|Enable the service.|
