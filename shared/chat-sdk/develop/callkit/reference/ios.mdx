### Sample project

Agora provides an open-source [AgoraChat-ios](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/AgoraChat-ios) sample project on GitHub. You can download the sample to try it out or view the source code.

The sample project uses the Chat user ID to join a channel, which enables displaying the user ID in the view of the call. If you use the methods of the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> to start a call, you can also use the Integer UID to join a channel.
