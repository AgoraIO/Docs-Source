This document presents the best practice to reliably integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> in your app. Before reading this document, follow the [<Vpd k="NAME" /> quickstart](../get-started/quickstart) to understand the basic process of using <Vpd k="NAME" />.

## Ensure high availability of streaming services

To ensure high availability of streaming services, and to avoid outages caused by regional network failures, Agora provides alternate domain names. Implement the following best practice to switch to an alternate domain name:

1. Based on the geographical location of your source stream, use the primary domain name from the following table:

    | Geographical area | Primary domain name | Alternate domain name |
    |:----|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|
    | North America | `rtls-ingress-prod-na.agoramdn.com` | `rtls-ingress-prod-backup-na.agoramdn.com` |
    | Europe | `rtls-ingress-prod-eu.agoramdn.com` | `rtls-ingress-prod-backup-eu.agoramdn.com` |
    | Asia except Mainland China | `rtls-ingress-prod-ap.agoramdn.com` | `rtls-ingress-prod-backup-ap.agoramdn.com` |
    | Chinese mainland | `rtls-ingress-prod-cn.agoramdn.com` | `rtls-ingress-prod-backup-cn.agoramdn.com` |

1. If the request using the primary domain name fails, use the same domain to try again. 

1. If the attempt still fails again, try the alternate domain name.

## Ensure high availability of REST services

## Troubleshooting checklist

Refer to the following checklist to quickly confirm if each integration requirement for ensuring the connectivity and reliability of the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service has been met.

| # | Importance | Check |
|:--|:-----------|:------------|
| 1	| required | The <Vpd k="NAME" /> service has been enabled for your App ID. |
| 2	| required | The API call rate is below the maximum limit. See [API Call Limits](#api-call-limits) for details. |
| 3	| required | The number of concurrent tasks in a project is less than 50. For details, see the [maximum number of concurrent tasks](#maximum-number-of-concurrent-tasks). |
| 4	| required | <ul><li>The `region` is set to the geographical region of your media stream source.</li><li> The `region` code is in lowercase. </li></ul>|
| 5	| optional | If calling the RESTful API fails, troubleshoot as follows:<br /><ul><li> Use a back-off strategy. </li><li> Check the [error code](rest-api/response-status-codes). </li></ul>If the above troubleshooting methods do not solve your issue, contact [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) with the `X-Request-ID` from the response header. |
| 6	| optional | If streaming fails using the RTMP/SRT protocol, please follow the steps below to troubleshoot:<br /><ul><li>Ensure that the stream key has not expired.</li><li>If you are using OBS streaming software, check that the frame loss rate is normal. </li></ul> If the above troubleshooting methods do not solve your issue, contact [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) with your streaming domain name and `streamKey` values.|
| 7 | Optional | If the streaming service or REST service is unavailable due to network failure, follow the following solutions to troubleshoot:<br /><ul><li>Try again using the current primary domain name.</li><li>Change to the backup domain name and try again.</li></ul> If the above troubleshooting methods do not solve your issue, contact [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) with your streaming domain name and `streamKey` values.|
