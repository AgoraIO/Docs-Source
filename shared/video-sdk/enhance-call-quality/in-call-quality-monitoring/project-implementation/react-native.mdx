<PlatformWrapper platform="react-native">

In `IRtcEngineEventHandler`, implement the following real-time interaction quality statistics callbacks and audio or video state monitoring callbacks to understand user interaction experience:

- `onNetworkQuality`: Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality.
- `onRtcStats`: Reports real-time interaction statistics.
- `onLocalAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the sent audio stream.
- `onLocalAudioStateChanged`: Reports local audio stream state changes.
- `onRemoteAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote audio stream.
- `onRemoteAudioStateChanged`: Reports remote audio stream state changes.
- `onLocalVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the sent video stream.
- `onLocalVideoStateChanged`: Reports local video stream state changes.
- `onRemoteVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote video stream.
- `onRemoteVideoStateChanged`: Reports remote video stream state changes.

In your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, add the following code:

```typescript
// Continue registering event handlers for the remaining callbacks
agoraEngine.registerEventHandler({
    // Implement the onNetworkQuality callback
    onNetworkQuality: (_connection, uid, txQuality, rxQuality) => {
        console.log(
            'Network Quality: \n Uid =' + uid +
            ' \n TxQuality =' + txQuality +
            ' \n RxQuality =' + rxQuality
        );
    },

    // Implement the onRtcStats callback
    onRtcStats: (_connection, stats) => {
        console.log(
            'Rtc Stats: ' +
            '\n User count =' + stats.userCount +
            '\n Last mile delay =' + stats.lastmileDelay
        );
    },
    
    // Implement the onRemoteVideoStateChanged callback
    onRemoteVideoStateChanged: (_connection, uid, state, reason, elapsed) => {

        );
    },
    
    // Implement the onRemoteAudioStateChanged callback

    // Implement the onLocalVideoStateChanged callback
    onLocalVideoStateChanged: (source, state, error) => {
        console.log(
            'Local Video State Changed:
