This page shows you how to build the TEN Agent playground.

## Prerequisites

**Docker setting on Apple Silicon**

- Agora [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) and [App Certificate](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

- One of the following:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) / [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - [Node.js(LTS) v18](https://nodejs.org/en)

- Dual Core CPU or higher
- At least 4 GB RAM

For Apple Silicon Macs, uncheck "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation" in Docker settings. Note: This may result in slower build times on ARM, but performance will be normal when deployed to x64 servers.

Open TEN Agent in your code editor. In the root of the project, use `cd` command to create \`.env\` file from example.

    ```sh title="Terminal"
    cp ./.env.example ./.env
    ```

1. **Setup Agora App ID and App Certificate in .env file**

    Open the `.env` file and fill in Agora App ID and App Certificate.These will be used to connect to Agora RTC extension.

    ```bash title=".env"
    AGORA_APP_ID=
    AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=
    ```

1. **Start agent builder toolkit containers**

    In the same directory, run the `docker` command to compose containers:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    docker compose up -d
    ```

1. **Enter container**

    Use the following command to enter the container:

    ```bash title="Bash"
    docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash
    ```

1. **Build the agent**

    Use the following command to build the agent:

    ```bash title="Bash"
    task use
    ```

1. **Start the web server**

    Use the following command to start the web server:

    ```bash title="Bash"
    task run
    ```

1. **Edit playground settings**

    Open the playground at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to configure your agent.

    1.  Select a graph type (e.g. Voice Agent, Realtime Agent)
    2.  Choose a corresponding module
    3.  Select an extension and configure its API key settings
