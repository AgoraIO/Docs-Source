## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the overall technical architecture of <Vg k="FC"/>:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

The source code of <Vg k="FC"/> contains the following packages:

- `agora-classroom-sdk`: The <Vg k="ACS"/>, which contains the following modules:
    - `/lib/externals`: Stores video-related extensions such as beautifying and noise reduction.
    - `/src/infra/api`: SDK interface.
    - `/src/infra/configs`: Default color and theme configuration.
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
    - `/src/infra/capabilities`:
        - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
        - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.
    - `/src/ui-kit`: Common UI components.
- `agora-demo-app`: The <Vg k="ACS"/> demo app, supports Web, H5, Electron and other platforms, supports online classroom, online invigilation function, and provides code samples for online classroom before, during, and after class.

- `agora-plugin-gallery`: An independent plug-in library for <Vg k="ACS"/>, which inherits the `AgoraWidgetBase` class and implements the `AgoraWidgetLifecycle` interface. It includes plug-ins such as interactive whiteboard, IM chat, answering machine, voting machine, and timer.

- `agora-proctor-sdk`: The Agora Classroom invigilation scene SDK, including the following modules:
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
    - `/src/infra/capabilities`:
         - `/components`: Common UI components.
         - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
         - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.

- `fcr-ui-scene/`: General education scene SDK
    - `/src/uistores`: UI Store directory. UI Store is responsible for providing business logic encapsulation for UI components.
    - `/src/containers`: UI functional components combined with UI Store to become UI business components.
    - `/src/scenarios`: UI scene. Scenarios are composed of multiple business components.
    - `/src/extension`: API package for communicating with Widget
    - `/src/resources`: Static resource files such as pictures and sounds
    - `/src/utils`: Common UI components

- `fcr-ui-kit/`: Common scene UI component library
    - `/src/components`: Common UI components
    - `/src/utils`: General hooks tool class

- `agora-common-libs`: General tool class library, including ThemeProvider, I18nProvider, and other global general tools

- `agora-edu-core`: Provides upstream API calls and downstream data structure encapsulation for education and proctoring scenarios in smart classrooms.

- `agora-rte-sdk`: Provides cross-end RTC adaptation capabilities as well as classroom event callbacks and data structure encapsulation.

## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> into your web project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-classroom-sdk) or CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13) on GitHub.

### Use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>

If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through npm or CDN.

#### Through npm

1. To install the SDK, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install agora-classroom-sdk
    ```

2. To import the `AgoraEduSDK` module, add the following code in the Javascript code in your project.

    ```
    import {AgoraEduSDK} from 'agora-classroom-sdk'
    ```

3. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

   <Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">Flexible Classroom's dependency `agora-electron-sdk` contains the native Node.js module. It is not recommended to use webpack and other construction tools for secondary compilation; otherwise, there may be an error that the Node.js module cannot be found. It is recommended to set these two libraries as external dependencies in the project configuration. For example: `externals: {'agora-electron-sdk': 'commonjs2 agora-electron-sdk'}`.    </Admonition>

#### Through CDN

1. Add the following code to the HTML file in your project:

    ```html
        <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.9.0.bundle.js"></script>
        <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_widget@2.9.0.bundle.js"></script>
    ```

2. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what a <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purposes, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.
