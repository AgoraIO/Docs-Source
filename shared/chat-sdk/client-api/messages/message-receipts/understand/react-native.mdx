The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> uses `IChatManager` to provide message receipt, which includes delivery receipts and read receipts. Followings are the core methods:

- `ChatOptions.requireDeliveryAck`: Enable message delivery receipts. 
- `ChatOptions.requireAck`: Enable conversation and message read receipts.
- `ChatManager.sendConversationReadAck`: Send a conversation read receipt.
- `ChatManager.sendMessageReadAck`: Send a message read receipt.
- `ChatManager.sendGroupMessageReadAck`: Send a group message read receipt.

The logic for implementing these receipts are as follows:

- Message delivery receipts

  1. The message sender enables delivery receipts by setting `ChatOptions.requireDeliveryAck` as `true`.
  2. After the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically sends a delivery receipt to the sender.
  3. The sender receives the delivery receipt by listening for `onMessageDelivered`.

- Conversation and message read receipts

  1. The message sender enables read receipt by setting `ChatOptions.requireAck` as `true`.
  2. After reading the message, the recipient calls `sendConversationReadAck` or `sendMessageReadAck` to send a conversation or message read receipt.
  3. The sender receives the conversation or message receipt by listening for `onConversationRead` or `onMessageRead`.
