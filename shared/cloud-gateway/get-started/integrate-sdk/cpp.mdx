This article shows how to integrate the <Vpd k="NAME" /> C++ SDK and run the sample project.

## Set up the development environment

Make sure your server meets the following requirements.

### Hardware environment

**Operating system**

- Ubuntu (14.04 or higher)
- CentOS (6.6 or higher)

**CPU architecture**

- arm64
- x86-64

If you need to run the SDK on other architectures, [submit a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to contact technical support.

**Performance**

- CPU：8-core, 1.8 GHz or higher.
- 2 GB of RAM or higher. 4 GB or higher is recommended.

**Network**

- The server is connected to the internet and has an internet IP.
- The server can access `*.agora.io` and `*.agoralab.co`.

### Software environment

- glibc 2.18 or later
- gcc 4.8 or later

If you are using Ubuntu, taking Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS as an example, install the following dependencies in your server:

```shell
# Install aptitude
sudo apt install aptitude
# Install build-essential libx11-dev libxcomposite-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxdamage-dev cmake
sudo aptitude install libx11-dev libxcomposite-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxdamage-dev cmake
```

If you are using CentOS, taking CentOS 7.9.2009 as an example, install the following dependencies in your server:

```shell
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install wget
sudo yum groupinstall X11
```

## Get an Agora App ID and an <Vg k="VSDK" /> Temporary Token

See [Get Started with Agora](../reference/manage-agora-account) to learn how to get an **Agora App ID** and an **<Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token**.

## Get the SDK

Run the following command to get the latest x86-64 SDK package and decompress the file. If you need to get the SDK build on other architectures, [submit a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to contact technical support.

```shell
# Get SDK
wget https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/Agora-RTC-x86_64-linux-gnu-v3.8.202.20-20220627_152601-214165.tgz
# Decompress the tgz file
tar xvf Agora-RTC-x86_64-linux-gnu-v3.8.202.20-20220627_152601-214165.tgz
```

## Compile the sample project

Run the following commands to compile the sample project:

```shell
# Switch to the sample project folder
cd agora_rtc_sdk/example
# Build the sample project
./build-x86_64.sh
# Sync and video/audio data needed by the project
cd out
../sync-data.sh
# Export the libraries from the SDK to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../agora_sdk:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Run the project that sends media streams from the server

This section uses the **sample_send_h264_pcm** project to demonstrate sending media streams from the server.

### Steps to run

Run the **sample_send_h264_pcm** sample project. Replace `YOUR_RTC_TOKEN`, the parameter value of `--token`, with your <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token. Replace the parameter value of `--channelId` with the value of your <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel ID. In this page, the value of `--channelId` is set to `demo_channel`.

<div class="alert note">You must specify the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel ID that is used to generate the <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token.</div>

```shell
# Run sample_send_h264_pcm to send video in H.264 format and audio in PCM format
./sample_send_h264_pcm --token YOUR_RTC_TOKEN --channelId demo_channel --videoFile test_data/send_video.h264 --audioFile test_data/send_audio_16k_1ch.pcm
```

### Use the client to receive streams sent from the server

1. Use a PC or mobile device to open the [Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> Web SDK sample project](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) and specify the following fields:

    - **APP ID**：Specify your Agora app ID, which must be the same as the app ID used in the server; otherwise, the server cannot communicate with the client.
    - **Channel Name**：Specify your channel name, which must be the same as the channel ID used in the server; otherwise, the server cannot communicate with the client. In this page, we set the value to `demo_channel`.
    - **Token**: Specify your <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token, which is the same as the temporary token used in the server.

2. Click **Join** to receive media streams from the server.

## Run the project that receives media streams from the client

This section  uses the **sample_send_h264_pcm** project to demonstrate receiving media streams from the client.

### Steps to run

Run the **sample_receive_h264_pcm** project. Replace `YOUR_RTC_TOKEN`, the parameter value of `--token`, with your <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token. Replace the parameter value of `--channelId` with the value of your <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel ID. In this page, the value of `--channelId` is set to `demo_channel`.

```shell
# Run sample_receive_h264_pcm to receive video in H.264 format and audio in PCM format
./sample_receive_h264_pcm --token YOUR_RTC_TOKEN --channelId demo_channel
```

When the sample project is running, the console prints the following information:

```text
[ APP_LOG_INFO ] Subscribe streams from all remote users
[ APP_LOG_INFO ] Start receiving audio & video data ...
[ APP_LOG_INFO ] Created file received_audio.pcm to save received PCM samples
[ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserAudioTrackStateChanged: userId 4088243221, state 1, reason 0

[ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserInfoUpdated: userId 4088243221, msg 1, val 1
```

### Use the client to send media streams to the server

1. Use a PC or mobile device to open the [Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> Web SDK sample project](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) and specify the following fields:

- **APP ID**：Specify your Agora app ID, which must be the same as the app ID used in the server; otherwise, the server cannot communicate with the client.
- **Channel Name**：Specify your channel name, which must be the same as the channel ID used in the server; otherwise, the server cannot communicate with the client. In this page, the value is set to `demo_channel`.
- **Token**: Specify your <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token, which is the same as the temporary token used in the server.

2. Click **Join** to receive media streams to the server.

    When the sample project is running, the console prints the following information:

    ```text
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserInfoUpdated: userId 436868190, msg 0, val 1
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserInfoUpdated: userId 436868190, msg 4, val 1
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserInfoUpdated: userId 436868190, msg 8, val 1
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserInfoUpdated: userId 436868190, msg 1, val 1

    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserAudioTrackStateChanged: userId 436868190, state 2, reason 6
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] Created file received_video.h264 to save received H264 frames
    [ APP_LOG_INFO ] onUserAudioTrackStateChanged: userId 436868190, state 0, reason 7
    ```

The received video and audio are saved in the `received_video.h264` file and the `received_audio.pcm` file, respectively.
