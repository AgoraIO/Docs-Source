SQLCipher is used to encrypt the database that stores local messages. The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> uses `ChatManager` and `ChatConversation` to manage local messages. Followings are the core methods:

- `ChatManager.loadAllConversations`: Loads the conversation list on the local device.
- `ChatManager.deleteAllMessageAndConversation`: Clears the current user's chat history, including messages and conversations in individual chats, group chats, and chat rooms. You can also choose whether to clear the chat history on the server in one direction.
- `ChatManage.deleteConversation`: Deletes the specified conversation.
- `ChatManager.deleteMessage`: Deletes a message sent or received in a local conversation.
- `ChatManager.deleteAllMessages`: Deletes all messages sent and received in a local conversation.
- `ChatManager.deleteMessagesWithTs`: Deletes messages sent and received in a certain period in a local conversation.
- `ChatConversation.getUnreadMessageCount`: Retrieves the count of unread messages in the specified conversation.
- `ChatManager.getUnreadMessageCount`: Retrieves the count of all unread messages.
- `ChatManager.pinConversation`: Pins a conversation.
- `ChatManager.fetchPinnedConversations`: Retrieves the pinned conversations from the server with pagination.
- `ChatManager.deleteRemoteConversation`: Deletes the conversation and historical messages from the server.
- `ChatManager.searchMsgFromDB`: Searches for messages from the local database.
- `ChatManager#loadMessagesWithKeyword`: Searches for messages in all conversations based on the search scope.
