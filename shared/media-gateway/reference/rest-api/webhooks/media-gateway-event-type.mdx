After enabling the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> service, the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server will send a channel event notification callback to your server using the HTTPS POST request method. When the value of the `product_id` parameter in the callback request body is `10`, it means that the <Vpd k="NAME" /> event is returned.

This page introduces the types and descriptions for all events returned in the channel event callback.
