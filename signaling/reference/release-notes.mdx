import ReleaseNotes from '@docs/shared/signaling/release-notes/index.mdx';

export const toc = [{}];

The following features are deprecated starting from v1.5.0:

- Send and receive image or file messages
- Historical messages
- Offline messages

If you have integrated those features in an earlier release and want to continue using them, you can do so in v1.4.x.

The Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> provides a streamlined and stable messaging mechanism for you to quickly implement real-time messaging for various scenarios. See [product overview](../overview/product-overview) for more information.
