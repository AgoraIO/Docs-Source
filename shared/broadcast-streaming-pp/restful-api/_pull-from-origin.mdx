Pull-from-origin means that after receiving a playback request from a viewer, the Agora servers pull streams from your origin server and deliver the content to the viewer. You can use the pull-from-origin function in one of the following ways:

- Direct pull: When a playback request is received, Agora directly pulls streams from the origin server you set.
- Dynamic pull: When a playback request is received, Agora first sends a request to your callback URL to get the origin server address, and then pulls streams from the address.

<a name="callback"></a>
## Pull-from-origin callback requirements
If you specify `callbackUrl` when calling the [Set pull-from-origin configuration](#pull) API, Agora sends requests to this URL to get your origin server addresses. The request sent by Agora has the following format:

```shellscript
GET https://example.origin-site.com/entry_point={entry_point}&stream_name={stream_name} HTTP/1.1
```

Where the following parameters are replaced according to the playback URL:
- `entry_point` : Replaced with the entry point in the playback URL.
- `stream_name`: Replaced with the stream name in the playback URL.

For such a request, the HTTP response you return must meet the following requirements:

- The response is in JSON format.
- If the request succeeds, the HTTP status code is 200.
- The origin server addresses are included in the `url` field in the response body:
   ```json
   {
       "url": "rtmp://cdna.example.com/live/testedge"
   }
   ```
