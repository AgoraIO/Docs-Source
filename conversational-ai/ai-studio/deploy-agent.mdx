After testing your agent pipeline and confirming it works as expected, you can deploy it to production. Deploying an agent makes it available for use in your selected Agora projects.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure:

- Your pipeline is fully configured with valid ASR, LLM, and TTS credentials
- You have tested your agent and verified it responds correctly

## Deploy your agent

To deploy your agent:

1. Click the **Deploy Agent** button at the bottom of the pipeline editor to open the Deploy panel.

1. Review and configure the deployment settings:

   - **Note**: Add a description for this deployment for your reference. This helps you identify the purpose or version of the deployment.
   - **Deploy To**: Select the Agora project(s) where you want to deploy the agent. You can deploy to multiple projects simultaneously.
   - **Cost Overview**: Review the billing breakdown for ASR, LLM, TTS, and agent hosting services. This shows how agent use is billed.

1. Click the **Deploy** button to continue.
1. Review the deployment summary, then click **Deploy** to confirm.

Your agent is now deployed and available for use in the selected projects.

## Manage deployed agents

To view and manage your deployed agents:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Agents** from the sidebar.
1. The Agents page displays all your deployed agents with their project name, App ID, and current status.

From the Agents page, you can:

- Monitor agent status and availability
- Pause or resume an agent

    Pausing a deployment immediately stops the agent from serving requests in the associated projects. Ensure no active integrations or services depend on this agent before pausing.
    </Admonition>

## Update a deployed agent

To update a deployed agent with changes from its pipeline:

1. Make your desired changes to the pipeline in the pipeline editor.
1. Click **Deploy Agent** and select the same project(s) as the original deployment.
1. Click **Re-deploy**
1. Confirm the deployment.

The updated configuration replaces the existing deployment in the selected projects.
