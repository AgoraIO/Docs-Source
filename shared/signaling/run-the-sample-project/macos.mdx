Refer to the following steps to integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> into the sample project:

1.  Download the [<Vg k="SIG" />](https://github.com/AgoraIO/RTM) repository on Github, and locate the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS` folder or the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS-Objective-C` folder.

    Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS is implemented in Swift; Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS-Objective-C is implemented in Objective-C.

2.  Download the latest version of [Real time Messaging SDK (macOS)](../reference/downloads.html) and extract the files.

3.  Integrate per your SDK version:

    -   (1.4.3 or earlier) Copy the `.framework` file in `libs` to `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS\Agora-RTM-Tutorial` or `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS-Objective-C\Agora-RTM-Tutorial` .

    -   (1.4.4 or later)
        &lt;ol&gt;

        1.  Copy the `.framework` file in `libs` to `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS\Agora-RTM-Tutorial` or `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS-Objective-C\Agora-RTM-Tutorial` .

        2.  Open Xcode, navigate to **TARGETS &gt; Project Name &gt; General &gt; Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** and click **-** to remove the following libraries

            -   libc++.tbd

            -   libresolv.tbd

            -   SystemConfiguration.framework

            -   CoreWLAN.framework

        3.  Change the **Embed** property of `AgoraRtmKit.framework` to **Embed & Sign**.

### 4. Run the sample project

Refer to the following steps to run the sample project:

1.  (Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS) Enter your App ID in `AppId.swift`; (Agora-RTM-Tutorial-macOS-Objective-C) Enter your App ID in `AppId.m`.

2.  Compile and run the sample project.

3.  Enter any string as the user ID (such as `userA`) and click **Login** to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />.

    You need to specify the user ID yourself. The user ID supports the following character set:

    -   All lowercase English letters: a to z

    -   All uppercase English letters: A to Z
