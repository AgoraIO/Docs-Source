When interacting with conversational AI in real time, you can enable real-time transcripts to display the conversation content. This page explains how to implement real-time transcripts in your app.

## Understand the tech

<Tech />

The toolkit receives transcript content through the `onTranscriptUpdated` callback and supports monitoring the following types of transcript data:

* **Agent transcript**: Transcribes the agent’s speech. Includes real-time updates and final results.

* **User transcript**: Transcribes the user’s speech. Supports real-time display and status management.

* **Transcript status**: Reports status updates such as in progress, completed, or interrupted.

The following diagram outlines the step-by-step process to integrate live transcript functionality into your application:
