Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> to join <Vpd k="NAME"/>. Each token is valid for a limited period and works only for a specific channel. For example, you cannot use the token generated for a channel called `AgoraChannel` to join the `AppTest` channel.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use it to connect securely to a specific <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel.

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel.

When users attempt to connect to an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:


-   The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The [App certificate](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The channel name

-   The user ID of the user to be authenticated (optional)

-   The privilege of the user, either as a publisher or a subscriber

-   The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

-  Implemented the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk)
-  Created a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account

<Prerequisites />

## Project setup

To integrate token authentication into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

1.  Open the project you created in the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk).

2.  Log in to your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.

## Implement the authentication workflow

In the *Get Started* project you implemented, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an authentication token obtained manually from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to join a channel. In a production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1.  [Create and run a token server](#create-and-run-a-token-server)

2.  [Retrieve and use tokens from a token server](#retrieve-and-use-tokens-from-a-token-server)

### Create and run a token server

This section shows you how to deploy a token server on Heroku.

1.  [Click here and deploy a token server to Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service).

    Heroku retrieves the project code and necessary files from Github and takes you to a **Create New App** page. On this page, fill in the following information:

    1.  `app-name`: A name for your token server, containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.

    2.  `APP_CERTIFICATE`: The <Vg k="APP-CERTIFICATE-LINK" /> obtained from <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Console

    3.  `APP_ID`: The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) obtained from <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Console

2.  Click **Deploy app**. Heroku configures and builds the token server.

    You see a message 'Your app was successfully deployed.'

3.  Click **View**.

    Heroku opens the token server URL in your browser. The URL is of the form `<app-name>.herokuapp.com` where `<app-name>` is the name you chose for your token server.

    Don’t worry if you see `404 page not found` in your browser. Follow the next steps and test your server.

4.  Test your server

    1.  Ping the server

        Load the following URL in a browser tab. Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your server.
            ```text
            https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com/ping
            ```
        You see the following message in your browser:
            ```json
            {"message":"pong"}
            ```
    2.  Retrieve a token

        To retrieve an RTC token, send a request to the token server using a URL based on the [Token server GET request structure](#token-server-get-request-structure):

        ```text
        /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
        ```

        For example: `https://my-token-server.herokuapp.com/rtc/MyChannel/1/uid/0/?expiry=300`

        Your token server returns the following JSON object to your browser:

        ```json
        {"rtcToken":"ThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleToken"}
        ```

### Authentication using <Vg k="VSDK" />

To retrieve tokens from the token server and use them to authenticate your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> using  <Vg k="VSDK" />

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token authentication workflow in your app:

1.  [Generate a token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

    Users communicate securely using channels in the same project. The *App ID* you use to generate this token must be the same one you supplied to Heroku.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

{ props.TYPE === "UIKIT" ? <ProjectTestUIKit /> : <ProjectTest /> }

Your <Vpl k="PLATFORM" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> magically connects to the same channel you used in web demo. You don’t need to hardcode a token in your app; each channel is secured with a specific token, and each token is refreshed automatically. That’s pretty cool!

#### Source code for a token server

The token server RESTful web service used in this page is written in Golang using the Gin framework. Want to use the code in your authentication service? [Download](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service/releases/tag/v1.1.1) the token server source code and binaries for various platforms from Github.

To see how to create a token generator inside your IAM system, see [Integrate a token generator](../develop/integrate-token-generation).

#### Token server GET request structure

A token server GET request has the following structure:

    ``` html
    /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
    ```

-   `:channelName` is the name of the Agora Channel you wish to join

    A channel name may contain numbers with both upper and lower case letters. The name length must be less than 64 characters.

-   `:role` is the user role

    Use `1` for publisher, `2` for subscriber.

-   `:tokentype` is the type of token

    <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> supports both integer user IDs and string user accounts for token generation. To ensure smooth communication, all the users in a channel must use the same type of ID, that is, either the integer `uid`, or a string `userAccount`. Best practice is to use the `uid`.

-   `:uid` is the user ID

    User Id can be any 32-bit unsigned integer. It can be set to 0, if you do not need to authenticate the user based on the user ID.

-   `expireTime` (optional) is the number of seconds after which the token will expire

    By default, a token expires after 24 hours unless a shorter life span is explicitly specified in the token request.
