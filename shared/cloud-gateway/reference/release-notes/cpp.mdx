## Version 4.2.30

v4.2.30 was released on January xx, 2024.

### New Features

- Multipath network transmission

This release adds the multipath network transmission feature, which allows simultaneous transmission of audio and video streams over multiple network paths. For example, when you insert two IoT SIM cards in the device, the SDK can transmit audio and video streams through the network of both SIM cards, thereby improving the stability and reliability of audio and video transmission. Contact support@agora.io to enable and use this feature.

- Hardware encoding acceleration

This release supports utilizing NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration for video encoding, which reduces the power consumption of CPU and improves hardware encoding efficiency and performance. Contact support@agora.io to enable and use this feature.

### Improvements

- Audio sending timestamp

To set the timestamp at which you send the audio data, this release adds the `presentation_ms` parameter in the `sendAudioPcmData` method. In scenarios such as video conferences and remote collaboration, this parameter allows you to achieve audio and video synchronization.

### Bug Fixes

This release fixed the following issues:

- App memory growth caused by receiving H.264 video raw data.
- Garbled data stream when using both string-type user IDs and data stream functions simultaneously.

## Version 4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on January xx, 2023.

### New features

- Pushing streams to a CDN directly

This release supports pushing media streams to a CDN directly. Hosts can convert the protocol of media streams to the RTMP protocol and push media streams to CDN directly. Audience members can subscribe to media streams by clicking the corresponding URL.

This release provides the `IRtmpConnection` and `IRtmpLocalUser` classes to connect the SDK and CDN, set audio and video encoding configurations, and push media streams to CDN. To get the connection state to CDN and the push state of media streams, you can register `IRtmpConnectionObserver` and `IRtmpLocalUserObserver` objects to listen for the related callbacks.

- Stream message

To support sending and receiving messages in digital scenarios such as an avatar, this release adds the stream message function. A sender can call the `createDataStream` and `sendStreamMessage` methods in sequence to create a stream and send a stream message; a receiver can get data in the `onStreamMessage` callback when the reception is successful.

### Improvements

- Custom background of custom video renderer

To make video interactions more fun, users sometimes want to modify the background of a remote user to match their own preferences. To meet such requirements, this release adds the `alphaBuffer` parameter in the `ExternalVideoFrame` class. In a custom video renderer scenario, you can use this parameter to render the video background into various effects, such as transparent, solid color, picture, or video. Multiple users can render different video backgrounds locally for the same remote user without affecting each other.

- Audio quality of experience


This release adds the `qoe_quality` and `quality_changed_reason` parameters in the `RemoteAudioTrackStats` class to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the local user when receiving a remote audio stream and to provide the reason for poor QoE.

- Meeting scenarios


To improve the user experience in meeting scenarios, this release adds `AUDIO_SCENARIO_MEETING(8)` in `AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE`.

- Domain restrictions for IoT SIM cards


Some scenarios with high security requirements use targeted Internet of Things (IoT) SIM cards and restrict the network domains that IoT SIM cards can access. This release adds the `domainLimit` parameter in the `AgoraServiceConfiguration` class. You can enable domain restrictions and set the SDK to only access networks with the specified domain name, so that you can ensure that devices using a targeted IoT SIM card are interoperable with other devices.
