- After calling `renewToken` to renew the token, some services were not functioning correctly, resulting in unexpected disconnection.

### v2.1.9

v2.1.9 was released on February 14, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release improves message publishing options as follows:

- Removes the `sendTs` parameter and adds the `channelType` parameter in `PublishOptions`. See details in [`PublishOptions`](../reference/api/#messagepublishpropsag_platform).
- Modifies the type of the `options` parameter in the `publishTopicMessage` method from `PublishOptions` to `TopicMessageOptions`. See details in [`TopicMessageOptions`](../reference/api/#topicpublishpropsag_platform).

Make sure to modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

#### Improvements

This release adds the following improvements:

- Adds error codes: `INVALID_CHANNEL_TYPE`, `RTM_ERROR_INVALID_ENCRYPTION_PARAMETER`, and `RTM_ERROR_OPERATION_RATE_EXCEED_LIMITATION`. For error code descriptions and solutions, see [Error Codes](../reference/api#error-codes-table).
- Optimizes the handling logic for expired user status data during reconnection.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the occasional crash issue when calling the `getOnlineUsers` method to retrieve paginated results.

### v2.1.7

v2.1.7 was released on January 22, 2024.

#### New features

1. Stream Channel

    Experience seamless, delay-free data flow from one point to another. Stream channel solution refers to a real-time data pipeline that enables the uninterrupted flow of data from one point to another without delay or latency.

2. Pub/Sub

    Embrace asynchronous messaging, enabling instant communication between publishers and subscribers without the need for immediate responses. The pub/sub model is a messaging pattern used in real-time messaging solutions where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive messages from the channels they are subscribed to.

3. Topic

    Effectively manage data streams with topics, enabling seamless communications between users. Topic serves as a data flow management mechanism in the stream channel. It enables users to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events of data streams. Topics allow users to register as message publishers, send messages, and receive messages from subscribed publishers in a channel.

4. Storage

    Storage is important in signaling solutions to ensure reliable message delivery and prevent message loss or drop.

5. Removing Event Listeners

    This release adds the removeEventListener method. You can use it to remove a specified event listener.

6. Interval Mode

    This release supports the interval mode of presence function. When the number of online users in a channel exceeds the specified Announce Max value, the channel enters the interval mode. The SDK triggers the presence event notification at regular intervals and provides aggregated incremental information about user join, leave, timeout, and state changes in the interval property. For more details, see [Interval Mode](../reference/api#presence-event-types).

7. Locks

    Implement locks to maintain the sequence of messages, ensuring your data is processed in a specific order, preventing any data conflicts. When a client accesses a resource, it can acquire a lock on that resource to prevent other clients from accessing it.
