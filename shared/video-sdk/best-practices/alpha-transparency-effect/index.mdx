Portrait segmentation involves separating the broadcaster from their background, to facilitate dynamic background changes and effects in video streams. In various real-time audio and video interaction scenarios, applying portrait segmentation makes interactions more engaging, enhances immersion, and improves the overall experience. 
<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, windows">
Consider the following sample scenarios:

* **Broadcaster background replacement**: The audience sees the broadcaster's background in the video replaced with a virtual scene, such as a gaming environment, a conference, or a tourist attractions.

* **Animated virtual gifts**: Display dynamic animations with a transparent background to avoid obscuring live content when multiple video streams are merged.

* **Chroma keying during live game streaming**: The audience sees the broadcaster's image cropped and positioned within the local game screen, making it appear as though the broadcaster is part of the game.
