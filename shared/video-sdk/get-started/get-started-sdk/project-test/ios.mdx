Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In your code update the `appId` and `token`, with the app ID and temporary token you obtained from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channelName` you filled in when generating the temporary token.

1. Connect your iOS device to your computer.

    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video window; the audience can see the host in the remote video window and hear the host.
