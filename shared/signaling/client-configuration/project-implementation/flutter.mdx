### Geographical area configuration

To specify geographical areas for Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ connections, refer to the following code:

```dart
// Create a Set containing specific RtmAreaCode values
Set<RtmAreaCode> areaCodes = {RtmAreaCode.na, RtmAreaCode.eu};

// Use the areaCodes in RtmConfig
RtmConfig config = RtmConfig(
  areaCode: areaCodes 
);
```

### Proxy configuration

In some environments with restricted network services, you may need to set up a proxy service to access external resources. <Vg k="SIG" /> supports configuring a proxy service. You enable this feature during the the <Vg k="SIG" /> instance initialization.

```dart
RtmProxyConfig proxyConfig = new RtmProxyConfig()

// Set proxy type as HTTP.
proxyConfig.proxyType = RtmProxyType.HTTP;
// Set your proxy server address.
proxyConfig.server = "192.168.11.101";
// Set your listener port.
proxyConfig.port = 8080;
// Set your proxy account
proxyConfig.account = "your_account";
// Set your proxy password
proxyConfig.password = "your_password"

RtmConfig config = new RtmConfig();
// initialize proxyConfig
config.proxyConfig = proxyConfig;

try {
    mRtmClient = RtmClient.create(rtmConfig);
} catch(Exception e) {
    log(INFO, "create rtm client failed with exception: " e.toString());
}
```

### Private deployment configuration

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> is committed to offering its customers flexible, secure, and customizable solutions. Since version `2.2.0`, <Vg k="SIG" /> supports private deployments. This feature enables you to deploy and manage the <Vg k="SIG" /> environment yourself, giving you more control over your data and systems. 

<Vg k="SIG" /> provides `MESSAGE` and `STREAM` services. Choose one or both services based on your needs and budget. The following code shows you how to configure a private environment that deploys both services simultaneously:

```dart
final userId = 'your_userId';
final appId = 'your_appId';
late RtmClient rtmClient;

var privateConfig = RtmPrivateConfig(
    serviceType: { RtmServiceType.message, RtmServiceType.stream },
    accessPointHosts: ['private.hostname.com']);

var rtmConfig = RtmConfig( privateConfig:privateConfig );

try {
    final (status,client) = await RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig:rtmConfig);
    if (status.error == true) {
        print(status);
    } else {
        rtmClient = client;
        print('Initialize success!');
    }
} catch (e) {
    print('Failed to create RTM client: $e');
}
```

### Connection protocol

To ensure connection stability and continuous service availability, the RTM client establishes two transmission links for each service (`MESSAGE` service and `STREAM` service) when connecting to the edge server. By default, these links use the TCP and UDP protocols, respectively. This design ensures that network issues on one link do not affect the overall transmission. Compared to other WebSocket-based message transmission solutions, RTM's redundant link design maximizes transmission stability and message delivery rate.

In some cases, users may find that their network does not support UDP port transmission, either temporarily or permanently. To ensure the dual-link design operates effectively, the SDK allows users to configure both links to use the TCP protocol. This can be done by setting the `protocolType` field in the `RtmConfig`. Below is a code example that configures both links to use the TCP protocol:

```dart
late RtmClient rtmClient;
const protocolType = RtmProtocolType.tcpOnly;
const rtmConfig = RtmConfig(protocolType:protocolType);
try {
    final (status,client) = await RTM("myAppId", "Tony", rtmConfig:rtmConfig);
    if (status.error == true) {
        print(status);
    } else {
        rtmClient = client;
        print('Initialization success!');
    }
} catch (e) {
    print('Failed to create RTM client: $e');
}
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
The SDK does not support configuring both links to use the UDP protocol simultaneously.

### Log configuration

In the development and testing phase of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you may need to output more detailed information to locate and fix problems. Enable log output of the SDK and set the log information level by configuring `level` when initializing the <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance. 

```dart
const logConfig = RtmLogConfig(
    filePath: './rtm_logfile/',
    fileSizeInKB: 1024,
    level: warn );

const rtmConfig = RtmConfig( logConfig:logConfig );
```

Choose the log level from the following: 

| Enumeration value | Description   |
|----------|------------------------|
| `none`      | `0x0000`: Do not output any logs.    |
| `info`      | `0x0001`: Output logs of levels `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, and `info`. Best practice is to set the log level to this option. |
| `warn`      | `0x0002`: Only output logs of levels `fatal`, `error`, and `warn`.  |
| `error`     | `0x0004`: Only output logs of levels `fatal` and `error`. |
| `fatal`     | `0x0008`: Only output logs at the `fatal` level.   |

When your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is released to production, set the log level to `info`.
