To use <Vpd k="SDK" /> for audio communication, you implement a simple workflow in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a new or an existing channel using an app ID and an authentication token. If a channel of the given name exists within the context of the app ID, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel. If the named channel does not exist, a new channel is created that other users may join. Once the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel, it subscribes to one or more of the audio streams published in the channel. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> also publishes its own audio stream that other users in the channel subscribe to. Each user publishes streams that share their microphone or audio data.

The basics of joining and leaving a channel are presented in the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>. This document explains the common workflows you need to handle in your app.


## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the typical workflow you integrate into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in order to publish and subscribe to audio streams.

This page shows you how to add the following features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

* **Volume control**

    Users in a channel often need to adjust the volume for local and remote audio. For example, they may want to increase the input volume from remote users and decrease the local audio recording volume. You use <Vpd k="SDK" /> to enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to adjust recording and playback volumes. <Vpd k="SDK" /> also provides methods to mute local audio, audio from a particular remote user, or audio from all remote users. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides several methods to manage local and remote audio volumes. These methods enable the user to control:

        * **Recording signal volume**: The volume of the signal recorded by the local user.
        <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
        * **Playback signal volume**: The playback audio level, after audio mixing, for all remote users, or for a specific remote user.
        * **In-ear monitoring volume**: The volume of their own voice, users hear through wired earphones.
        </PlatformWrapper>
        * **Audio mixing volume**: The mixing volume for local playback and for sending to other users.
        * **Muting audio streams**: Stop or resume playing a specified remote or local audio.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to implement call quality best practice into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement volume control

This section shows how to use <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement volume control in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
