### Implement a user interface

In a real-word application, you report your local spatial position to a server in your environment and retrieve positions of remote users in the channel from your server. In this simple example, you use a slider to change the spatial position of a remote user. 

To add the Slider to the UI, in `/lib/main.dart`, add the following code to the `build` method after `ListView(...children: [`:

```dart
const Text('Move the slider to update spatial position'),
Slider(
    min: 0,
    max: 50,
    value: distance,
    onChanged: _isJoined ? (value) => {onDistanceChanged(value)} : null,
),
```

### Implement spatial audio

To implement spatial audio features in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. **Declare the variables you need**

    You create an instance of `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` to configure spatial audio parameters and set self and remote user positions. In `/lib/main.dart`, add the following declarations to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ```dart
    late LocalSpatialAudioEngine localSpatial;
    double distance = 0; // Used to manage spatial position
    ```

1. **Create and configure the spatial audio engine**

    To set up an instance of `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` at startup, take the following steps:

    1. When a user launches the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you create an instance of `LocalSpatialAudioEngine`, configure it and update the user's self position. To do this, add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class:

        ```dart
        void configureSpatialAudioEngine() async {
            // Enable spatial audio
            await agoraEngine.enableSpatialAudio(true);

            // Get the spatial audio engine
            localSpatial = agoraEngine.getLocalSpatialAudioEngine();

            // Initialize the spatial audio engine
            localSpatial.initialize();

            // Set the audio reception range of the local user in meters
            localSpatial.setAudioRecvRange(50);

            // Set the length of unit distance in meters
            localSpatial.setDistanceUnit(1);

            // Define the position of the local user
            var pos = [0.0, 0.0,0.0];
            var axisForward = [1.0, 0.0,0.0];
            var axisRight = [0.0, 1.0,0.0];
            var axisUp = [0.0, 0.0,1.0];

            // Set the position of the local user
            localSpatial.updateSelfPosition(
                position: pos, // The coordinates in the world coordinate system.
                axisForward: axisForward, // The unit vector of the x axis
                axisRight: axisRight, // The unit vector of the y axis
                axisUp: axisUp // The unit vector of the z axis
            );
        }
        ```

    1. To execute this method at startup, add the following line to `setupVideoSDKEngine();` after `await agoraEngine.enableVideo();`:

        ```dart
        configureSpatialAudioEngine();
        ```

1. **Set the spatial position of a remote user**

    To update the spatial position of a remote user, define the `RemoteVoicePositionInfo` and call `updateRemotePosition`. Add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class:

        ```dart
        void updateRemotePosition(double distance) {

            // Define the remote user's spatial position
            RemoteVoicePositionInfo positionInfo = RemoteVoicePositionInfo(
                position: [distance, 0.0, 0.0],
                forward: [distance, 0.0, 0.0],
            );

            // Update the spatial position of a remote user
            localSpatial.updateRemotePosition(
                uid: _remoteUid ?? 0, posInfo: positionInfo);
        }
        ```

1. **Change the spatial position when a user moves the slider**

    To update the spatial position of a remote user, you handle the `onChanged` callback of the slider. In `_MyAppState` class, add the following method:

        ```dart
        onDistanceChanged(double newValue) {
            setState(() {
            distance = newValue;
            updateRemotePosition(distance);
            });
        }
        ```
