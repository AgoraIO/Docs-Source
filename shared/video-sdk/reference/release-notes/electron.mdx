## Compatibility changes

**Integration change**

This release has changed the SDK package name from `electron-agora-rtc-ng` to `agora-electron-sdk`, and optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v3.7.0. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

    * Multiple channel
    * Media stream publishing control
    * Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see <Link to = "./develop/migration-guide"> Migrate from v3.x to v4.0.0 RC </Link>.

## New features

1. **Multiple media tracks**

    This release supports one `IRtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions`.

    After calling joinChannel to join the first channel, call joinChannelEx multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
    You can simultaneously publish multiple sets of video streams captured by multiple cameras or screen sharing by setting `publishSecondaryCameraTrack` and `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions`.
    This release adds `createCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured video in the channel:

    1. Create a custom video track: Call this method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
    
    1. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.

    1. Pushing an external video source: Call `pushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in step 2 in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

    You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

    * Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
    * Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
    * Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

2. **Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

    In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and now supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes.

    Additionally, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 × 2160) and the frame rate to 60 fps when calling `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

    > :warning: This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To experience this feature, contact technical support.

3. **Agora media player**

    To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

    * Plays local and online media files.
    * Preloads media files.
    * Changes the CDN route for playing media files according your network conditions.
    * Shares the audio and video streams being played with remote users.
    * Caches data when playing media files.

4. **Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

    The SDK supports a new version of Noise Suppression (in comparison to the basic Noise Suppression in v3.7.0). The new AI Noise Suppression has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option.

    > **_NOTE:_** This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To experience this feature, contact technical support.

5. **Ultra-high audio quality**

    To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `UltraHighQualityVoice` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

6. **Real-time chorus**

    This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

    * Two or more choruses are supported.
    * Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
    * Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

    This release adds the `AudioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AudioScenarioType`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

7. **Enhanced channel management**

    To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

    * Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
    * Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
    * Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
    * Controls audio publishing delay.

    Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.

8. **Screen sharing**

    This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function in the following ways.

    * Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.
    * Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method after joining a channel, and then call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.


9. **Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

    This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blocklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `IRtcEngineEx` interface:

    * `SetSubscribeAudioBlocklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
    * `SetSubscribeAudioAllowlist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.
    * `SetSubscribeVideoBlocklist`：Set the video subscription blocklist.
    * `SetSubscribeVideoAllowlist`：Set the video subscription allowlist.

    If a user is added in a blocklist and a allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

10. **Set audio scenarios**

    To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `SetAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AudioScenarioDefault` to `AudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

11. **Replace video feeds with images**

    This release supports replacing video feeds with images when publishing video streams. You can call the `enableVideoImageSource` method to enable this function and choose your own images through the options parameter. If you disable this function, the remote users see the video feeds that you publish.

12. **Local video mixing**

    This release adds a series of APIs supporting local video mixing functions. You can mix multiple video streams into one video stream locally. Common scenarios are as follows:

    * In interactive live streaming scenarios with cohosts or when using the Media Push function, you can merge the screens of multiple hosts into one view locally.
    * In scenarios where you capture multiple local video streams (for example, video captured by cameras, screen sharing streams, video files or pictures), you can and merge them into one video stream and then publish the mixed video stream in the channel.

    You can call the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to start local video mixing and call the `stopLocalVideoTranscoder` method to stop local video mixing. After the local video mixing starts, you can call `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` to update the local video mixing configuration.

13. **Video device management**

    Video capture devices can support multiple video formats, each supporting a different combination of video frame width, video frame height, and frame rate.

    This release adds the `numberOfCapabilities` and `getCapability` methods for getting the number of video formats supported by the video capture device and the details of the video frames in the specified video format. When calling the `startPrimaryCameraCapture` or `startSecondaryCameraCapture` method to capture video using the camera, you can use the specified video format.

    > **_NOTE:_**: The SDK automatically selects the best video format for the video capture device based on your settings in `VideoEncoderConfiguration`, so normally you should not need to use these new methods.

## Improvements

1. **Fast channel switching**

    This release can achieve the same switching speed as `SwitchChannel` in v3.7.0 through the LeaveChannel and `JoinChannel` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `SwitchChannel` method.

2. **Push external video frames**

    This releases supports pushing video frames in `I422` format. You can call the `pushVideoFrame`[1/2] method to push such video frames to the SDK.

3. **Voice pitch of the local user**
   
    This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.

4. **Video preview**

    This release improves the implementation logic of `startPreview`. You can call the `startPreview` method to enable video preview at any time.

5. **Video types of subscription**

    You can call the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method to choose the video stream type when subscribing to streams.
