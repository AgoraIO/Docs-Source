The list of known issues page is continuously updated as the systems evolve. Agora suggests you regularly upgrade to the
 latest version of the SDK, which includes new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

 - Blueprint SDK v4.2.1

    **Audio module incompatibility (iOS)**

    The audio module of the Agora Blueprint SDK is incompatible with the AudioMixer module in Unreal Engine 5.3 and 5.4. If you use Unreal Engine 5.3 or 5.4, you need to add the following code to the `/Config/IOS/IOSEngine.ini` file in your project to disable Unreal Engineâ€™s AudioMixer module and avoid conflicts.

    ```ini
    [Audio]
    AudioMixerModuleName=
    ```
