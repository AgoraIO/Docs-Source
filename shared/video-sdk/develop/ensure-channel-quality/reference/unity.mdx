#### How video is oriented on the playing device

The way video is displayed on the playing device depends on `orientationMode` used on the encoding device, orientation of the capturing device, orientation of the playing device, and whether screen rotation is enabled on the playing device. The following images show how the video is finally oriented based on these factors.

#### Orientation mode: _Adaptive_

* Screen rotation: _Disabled_
* Capturing device orientation: _Landscape_
