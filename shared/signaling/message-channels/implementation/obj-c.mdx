### Subscribe to a channel

Use the `subscribeWithChannel` method to subscribe to a message channel. After you subscribe, you receive `didReceiveMessageEvent` and other event notifications within the channel.

```objc
[rtm subscribeWithChannel:@"you_channel" option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"subscribe success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"subscribe failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
```

To subscribe to multiple channels, call `subscribeWithChannel` multiple times:

```objc
[rtm subscribeWithChannel:@"chats.room1" option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"subscribe success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"subscribe failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];

[rtm subscribeWithChannel:@"chats.room2" option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"subscribe success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"subscribe failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
```

<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> allows a single client to subscribe to up to 50 message channels simultaneously. However, to optimize client performance and bandwidth usage, best practice is to limit subscriptions to 30 channels. If you have very large or highly active channels, consider further reducing the number of simultaneous subscriptions.

### Send a message

To send messages in a message channel, simply call the `publish` method without subscribing to the channel. This method sends messages to one channel at a time. To send messages to multiple channels, call this method multiple times. <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> does not limit the number of channels to which you can send messages, or the number of users who can send messages to a channel. However, there are certain restrictions on the frequency at which you can send messages to a channel simultaneously. See [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations) for details.

<Admonition type="alert" title="Info">
The `publish` method can only be used with a message channel and a user channel; it does not apply to a stream channel.
</Admonition>

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```objc
    // Send a string message
    NSString* message = @"Hello Agora!";
    NSString* channel = @"your_channel";
    [rtm publish:channel message:message option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
        if (errorInfo == nil) {
            NSLog(@"publish success!!");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"publish failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
        }
    }];

    ```

* Binary message

    ```objc
    // Sending string message
    NSString* message = @"Hello Agora!";
    NSString* channel = @"your_channel";
    [rtm publish:channel message:message option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
        if (errorInfo == nil) {
            NSLog(@"publish success!!");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"publish failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
        }
    }];
    ```

<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> currently supports only string and binary message formats. To send other types of data such as a JSON, object, or data from third-party data construction tools such as protobuf, serialize the data before sending the message. For information on how to effectively construct the payload data structure and recommended serialization methods, refer to [Message payload structuring](../best-practices/message-payload-structuring).

### Customize channel subscription

By default, you receive message events for all channels you subscribe to. If you don't wish to receive messages from specific channels, while still receiving other types of event notifications from these channels, avoid setting the `AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions` parameter to include `AgoraRtmSubscribeChannelFeatureMessage`. Refer to the following code snippet:

```objc
AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions* opt = [[AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions alloc] init];
opt.features = AgoraRtmSubscribeChannelFeaturePresence;
[rtm subscribeWithChannel:@"you_channel" option:opt completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"subscribe success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"subscribe failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
```

### Unsubscribe from a channel

To stop receiving messages and all event notifications from a channel, call the `unsubscribeWithChannel` method.

```objc
[rtm unsubscribeWithChannel:@"chats.room1" completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"unsubscribe success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"unsubscribe failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
```
This method only unsubscribes from one channel at a time. To unsubscribe from multiple channels, call this method multiple times.
