import * as data from '@site/data/variables';

**The RESTful API for <Vg k="MPULL" />** enables you to inject an online media stream into the Agora channel as a live video source. After the injection succeeds, the online media stream automatically plays in the Agora channel, and remote users can see the content of the media stream.

## Working principle

Injecting an online media stream into the Agora channel creates a <Vg k="MPULL" /> task (shown as "cloud player" in the rest of the article) in the Agora channel. You can control the cloud player through the RESTful API and accomplish the following functions for <Vg k="MPULL" />:

- `Create`: Creates a cloud player in the project.
- `Delete`: Destroys the cloud player in the project.
- `List`: Queries and lists all the cloud players in the project.

<Vg k="MPULL" /> supports the following formats:

- Video codec formats: H.264, H.265, and VP8
- Audio codec formats: AAC and OPUS
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, and RTMP
- Container formats: FLV, MP4, MPEG-TS, Matroska (MKV), and HLS

## Authentication

The RESTful APIs require basic HTTP authentication. You need to set the `Authorization` parameter in every HTTP request header. For how to get the value for Authorization, see [RESTful API authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).


## Create API

This API creates a cloud player in the project.

### HTTP request

```shellscript
POST https://api.agora.io/{region}/v1/projects/{appId}/cloud-player/players
```

#### Path parameters

- `appId`: (Required) String. Agora provides the [App ID](../reference/glossary#app-id) when you create a **project** in Agora Console. The App ID identifies each project.
- `region`: (Required) String. The region that the cloud player was created in. Agora supports the creation of cloud players in different regions. Currently, it supports four regions:
 - `cn`: China Mainland
 - `ap`: Asia Pacific
 - `na`: North America
 - `eu`: Europe
<div class="alert note">Please ensure that the region you set is the same region as where your media stream originates is located.</div>



#### Query parameters

A sample request URL when using query parameters:

```shellscript
https://api.agora.io/{region}/v1/projects/{appId}/cloud-player/players?streamIp={streamIp}
```

`streamIp`: (Optional) String. The IP address of the media stream's origin server. Must be a valid IPv4 address. Use this parameter to ensure the transmission quality of the media stream when the media stream is only available in some regions. Otherwise, ignore this parameter.

#### Request header

The request header contains the following fields:

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- `Authorization`: See [Authentication instructions](../reference/restful-authentication).
- `X-Request-ID`: UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify this request. After passing in the field, Agora's server returns it in the response header.

  > Agora recommends using this field. If you do not pass in any value, Agora's server automatically generates a UUID to pass in.

#### Request body

If the status code is 2XX, the request succeeds. The response body is a JSON Object called `player`, containing the following fields:

> - You must set the cloud player's username, which can be Number type or String type. Otherwise, the cloud player cannot be created, and Agora's server returns the `400(Bad Request)` status code. Ensure that you have read [How can I use a username in string type?](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/string) when using a username in String type.
> - To avoid the failed request, do not pass `null` or `""` in the required fields.



- `audioOptions`: (Optional) JSON Object. The audio transcoding configuration of the cloud player. Setting this field to empty or not set means that the audio is not transcoded.
 - `Profile`：Number. Audio profile. Sets the audio profile sample rate, bitrate, encoding mode, and the number of channels.
   - `0`: Default audio profile.
     - In the communication profile, the default audio profile represents a sample rate of 32 kHz, audio encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 18 Kbps.
     - In the live broadcasting profile, the default audio profile represents a sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 64 Kbps.

   - `true`: Enable portrait and landscape adaptive mode. After you enable the adaptive mode, if the source media stream is in landscape mode, the output video width and height are 1280 × 720; if the source media stream is in portrait mode, the output video width and height are 720 × 1280.
   - `false`: (Default) Do not enable portrait and landscape adaptive mode.
 - `frameRate`: The frameRate (fps) of the output video. The value range is [1,30]. The default value is 15. For details, see [Video profile table](/cloud-recording/develop/recording-video-profile#video-profile-table).
 - `bitrate`: Number. The bitrate (Kbps) of the output video. The value range is [1,10000]. For details, see [Video profile table](/cloud-recording/develop/recording-video-profile#video-profile-table).
 - `codec`: String type. The encoding format of the output video. The following settings are supported:
   - VP8: Standard VP8.
   - H.264: (Default) Standard H.264.
     If set to other value, the default is H.264 video encoding format.
 - `fillMode`: String. The fill mode of the output video:
   - `fit`: (Default) Scales the video proportionally until it is fully displayed in the viewport.
   - `fill`: Scales the video proportionally until it fills the viewport.
- `streamUrl`: (Required) String. The RTMP/HTTP/HTTPS URL of the online media stream. The maximum length of this field is 1024 bytes.
> To injetct an image to the Agora channel, set `streamUrl` to the URL of the image you want to inject, and the cloud player will convert the image to a video and inject it to the Agora channel. Images in JPEG and PNG formats are currently supported. You can set video transcoding parameters through `videoOptions`.

- `channelName`: (Required) String. The channel name. The maximum length of this field is 64 bytes. Supported character scopes are:
  - All lowercase English letters: a to z.
  - All uppercase English letters: A to Z.
  - All numeric characters: 0 to 9.
  - The space character.
  - Punctuation characters and other symbols, including: "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "\<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "|", "~", ",".
- `uid`: (Optional) Number. The User ID of the cloud player in the channel. The value ranges from 0 to (2<sup>32</sup>-1). When passing in `0`, Agora's server automatically assigns a User ID to the player.


  > Ensure that the value is different from any other User IDs of other users and players in the channel.
- `account`: (Optional) String. The User Account of the cloud player in the channel. The maximum length of this field is 255 bytes. Ensure that you set this parameter and do not set it as null. Supported character scopes are:
  - All lowercase English letters: a to z.
  - All uppercase English letters: A to Z.
  - All numeric characters: 0 to 9.
  - The space character.
  - Punctuation characters and other symbols, including: "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "\<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "|", "~", ",".

  > Ensure that the value is different from any other User Accounts of other users and players in the channel.

- `token`: (Optional) String. The authentication token used by the cloud player in the channel. If you do not enable the App Certificate in Agora Console, ignore this field. If you enable the App Certificate in Agora Console, you must pass a value in this field:
  - For low-security requirements: Use the temporary token generated in Agora Console. For details, see [Generate an <Vg k="VSDK" /> temporary token](manage-your-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token).
  - For high-security requirements: Use the token generated at your server. For details, see [Implement authentication workflow](/interactive-live-streaming/develop/authentication-workflow).

    > When generating a token at your server, the value of `uid` or `account` must be the same as the User ID or User Account of the cloud player, and `privilegeExpiredTs` is recommended to be `0` to ensure that the token is valid for 24 hours at most.

- `idleTimeout`: (Optional) Number. The maximum length of time (in seconds) that the cloud player is idle. The "idle" state means that the media stream is not playing. When the idle state exceeds `idleTimeout`, the cloud player is automatically destroyed. The value ranges from 5 to 600. The default value is 300. If the value is less than 5, Agora's server automatically adjusts it to 5; if the value is greater than 600, Agora's server automatically adjusts it to 600.
- `playTs`: (Optional) Number. The Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the cloud player starts playing the online media stream. The value range of playTs is [`createTs`-86400, `createTs`+300]. The default value is 0, which means the cloud player starts playing the online media stream when the cloud player is successfully created. If the value of `playTs` is not `0`, the following behavior occurs:
 - `playTs` > `createTs`: The cloud player starts playing the online media stream when the time is `playTs`. This is suitable for timing playback with other elements.
 - `playTs` < `createTs`: If the online media stream is a live stream, the cloud player starts playing the live stream when the cloud player is successfully created. If the online media stream is an on-demand stream, the cloud player starts playing the online media stream at the specified time in the stream prior to the creation of the cloud player. This is suitable for error recovery. For example, if the cloud player experiences an error during operation, you can create a new cloud player and set the `playTs` field of new cloud player to the unix timestamp when the old cloud player started to play the online media stream.
- `name`: (Optional) String. The name of the cloud player. The maximum length of this parameter is 64 bytes. Supported character scopes are:
  - All lowercase English letters: a to z.
  - All uppercase English letters: A to Z.
  - All numeric characters: 0 to 9.
  - "-", "_".
  `name` is null if you do not pass any value. Multiple cloud players using null name parameters can exist in one project at the same time; multiple cloud players with the same name cannot exist in one project at the same time. When trying to create a cloud player with the same name as an existing cloud player in the project, you will receive the `409(Conflict)` status code.

  > To avoid repeatedly creating multiple cloud players to inject the same online media stream into the same channel, use the `name` parameter to manage all the cloud players in your specified project. Agora recommends that you pass a value in `name` using a combination of the channel name (`channelName`) and the username (`uid` or `account`) of the cloud player, such as `class32_101` and `class33_teacher101` in the sample code.

- `encryptMode`: (Optional) String. Encryption mode. Agora recommends using either the `aes-128-gcm2` or `aes-256-gcm2` encryption mode, both of which support adding a salt and are more secure.
 - `aes-128-xts`: 128-bit AES encryption, XTS mode.
 - `aes-256-xts`: 256-bit AES encryption, XTS mode.
 - `aes-128-ecb`: 128-bit AES encryption, ECB mode.
 - `sm4-128-ecb`: 128-bit SM4 encryption, ECB mode.
 - `aes-128-gcm`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
 - `aes-256-gcm`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
 - `aes-128-gcm2`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode. Compared to `aes-128-gcm` encryption mode, `aes-128-gcm2` encryption mode is more secure and requires you to set the salt (`encryptKdfSalt`).
 - `aes-256-gcm2`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode. Compared to `aes-256-gcm` encryption mode, `aes-256-gcm2` encryption mode is more secure and requires you to set the salt (`encryptKdfSalt`).
- `encryptKey`: (Optional) String. Encryption key with unlimited length. Agora recommends using a 32-byte key.
 <div class="alert note">If you do not set an encryption key or set it as null, you cannot use the built-in encryption. </div>
- `encryptKdfSalt`: (Optional) String. The salt with the length of 32 bytes. Agora recommends using OpenSSL to generate the salt on your server. For details, see [Media Stream Encryption](/interactive-live-streaming/develop/media-stream-encryption).
 <div class="alert note">This parameter is only valid when you set the encryption mode as aes-128-gcm2 or aes-256-gcm2. In this case, ensure that this parameter is not 0. </div>
- `repeatTime`: (Optional) Int. Number of media streams played. This parameter applies only to on-demand streams. It can be set to:
 - `1`: (Default) Plays a media resource once.
 - `-1`: Plays media resources in a loop.
 - `N`: User-defined number of media resources to be played. It is an integer and cannot be set to `0`.
- `seekPosition`: (Optional) Number. Specifies the playback position (seconds) of the on-demand file. The default value is 0, which means play from the beginning of the on-demand file. It must be less than the media resource duration.
- dataStreamOptions: (Optional) JSON Object. The data stream configuration, which is used to set the SEI information carried by the video frame. This parameter applies only to on-demand streams.
 - `enable`: Set whether to inject the SEI information of Agora DataStream type.
   - `true`: Inject the SEI information of Agora DataStream type.
   - `false`: (Default) Do not inject the SEI information of Agora DataStream type.
    Agora DataStream is a data stream format of JSON type, the example is as follows:

	  ```json
	  message PositionData {
		# The length of the on-demand file
      int32 duration = 1;
		# The playback position of the on-demand file
      int32 position = 2;
		# The user ID of the host playing the on-demand file
      int32 uid = 3;
      }

	 ```

## List API

This API queries and lists all the cloud players in the project.

### HTTP request

```shellscript
GET https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/cloud-player/players
```

#### Path parameters

`appId`: (Required) String. Agora provides the [App ID](glossary#app=id) when you create a **project** in Agora Console. The App ID identifies each project.

#### Query parameters

A sample request URL when using query parameters:

```shellscript
https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/cloud-player/players?filter={filter}&pageSize={pageSize}&pageToken={pageToken}
```

- `filter`: (Optional) String. The filter. Agora's server only lists the cloud players that meet the filter criteria in the project. The current filter is the value of `channelName` when creating the cloud player.

  Assuming the channel name is `class32`, replace `filter={filter}` in the sample request URL with `filter=channelName eq class32`; Assuming the channel name is `bigclass`, replace `filter={filter}` in the sample request URL with `filter=channelName eq bigclass`.

  > Spaces exist before and after `eq` and require URL encoding.

- `pageSize`: (Optional) Number. The maximum number of cloud players to return on one page. The value ranges from 1 to 500. The default value is 200, which means that for a single page, Agora's server lists up to 200 cloud players if you do not pass in any value.
- `pageToken`: (Optional) String. The page number to indicate the order of the pages. If you do not pass in any value, Agora's server returns to the first page.

  > Recommended usage: When using the `List` API for the first time, do not pass any value in the `pageToken` query parameter. You can get the query results of the first page and the value of the `nextPageToken` field. The next time you use the `List` API, pass this value in the `pageToken` query parameter to query the cloud players on the next page.

After using the above parameters, Agora's server queries and lists the cloud players according to the following steps:
1. Query the cloud players that meet the filter criteria in the specified project.
2. Set the space size of each page.
3. List the cloud players in the specified page.

> Agora's server lists the cloud players in ascending order by `createTs`.

#### Request header

## RESTful API callback service

After using these RESTful APIs, Agora's notification server sends the callback notification to your server through HTTP or HTTPS request.
For details, see [Message Notification Service](../reference/ncs-events).

## Considerations
This section summarizes some important considerations when using the <Vg k="MPULL" /> RESTful API.

| Item                                                         | Impact |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Ensure that the channel profile is set as `LIVE_BROADCASTING`. | ★★★☆☆  |
| If the channel needs only one cloud player, ensure that you have set the `name` parameter. For details, see the description of `name`. | ★★★☆☆  |
| If the channel needs more than one cloud player, ensure that each player has a unique user ID/account. For details, see the description of `uid` and `account`. | ★★★★★  |
| Please ensure that the region you set is the same region as where your media stream originates is located. For details, see the description of `region`. | ★★★★★  |
| The cloud player may be deleted automatically due to server errors. Agora recommends that you enable the Message Notification Service to listen for events of <Vg k="MPULL" />. For details, see the [<Vg k="MPULL" /> Message Notification Server](../reference/enable-ncs/). | ★★★★★  |
| When using the `List` API, the `players` field in the response body might only include `id`, `name`, and `CreateTs`. Ensure that your app logic can handle this situation. | ★★★★★  |
| If using the `Create` or `Delete` API results in a status code of `504 Gateway Timeout`, call the `List` API to query the actual state of the cloud player to make sure an unmanaged cloud player does not exist. | ★★★☆☆  |
| If your request fails, ensure that you print out the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` fields in the response header in the log for later use in troubleshooting. | ★★★☆☆  |
| After creating a cloud player and receiving a response message, you need to wait about 10 seconds before using the `List` method to query, otherwise you may not get any information. | ★★★☆☆  |
| The default maximum number of concurrent tasks is 50, which means that a maximum of 50 <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks are allowed to run simultaneously for each project. You can contact [sales@agora.io](mailto:sales@agora.io) to get a higher quota. | ★★★★☆  |
