### Install required library through `vcpkg`

You can also install required library & Packages using the vcpkg package manager by following these steps:

1. **Install vcpkg** by following the instructions on the [official vcpkg GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
    ```

1. To complete the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where vcpkg is
cloned and run `bootstrap-vcpkg.sh`:

    ```sh
    cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ```

1. **Install the libraries**

    1. Install the **OpenSSL** libraries (**libssl.lib** and **libcrypto.lib**)

        ```sh
        vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
        ```

    1. Install the **zlib** library (**zlib.lib**)

        ```sh
        vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows
        ```
        Note: x64-windows is for 64-bit Windows. For 32-bit, use x86-windows.

    1. Once the installation is complete, in your Visual Studio project:

        1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project name and select **Properties** from the context menu.
        1. From the left-hand side menu, in the Property Pages, select **VC++ Directories** .
        1. Add the  `vcpkg installed directory include` path to the **Include Directories** field.

            For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you you have installed openssl & zlib, the path to the
            include directory is be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include\`

    1. In the Property Pages, select **Linker** from the left-hand side menu.

        1. Add the  `vcpkg installed directory lib` path to the **Library Directories** field.

             For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the library directory would be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib`.

    1. In the Property Pages, select **Linker > Input** from the left-hand side menu.
    1. Add **zlib.lib,libssl.lib** and **libcrypto.lib** to the **Additional Dependencies** field.

    1. In the  Property Pages, select **Debugging** from the left-hand side menu. then add the vcpkg directory
   containing the Dll files `vcpkg installed directory bin` path to the **Environment** field.

        For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the library directory would be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib`.

        **Note** : If this does not work, copy the require DLLs (**libssl-3-x64.dll,
        libcrypto-3-x64.dll** and **zlib1.dll**) from  vcpkg installed path bin directory (like `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin`)  to your project debug folder (like `<project name>\x64\Debug`)

  1. Save your changes and rebuild your project.
