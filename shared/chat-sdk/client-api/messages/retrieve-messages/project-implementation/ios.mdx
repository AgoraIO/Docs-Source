### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```objective-c
pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. Doesn't store offline messages. However, by default, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, and this number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

After the GA release of Agora Chat 1.3, you can log in to Agora Console and enable the chatroom message history retrieval feature. After that, Agora Chat servers will stop automatically pushing chatroom messages to new members and you can follow the guidance below to retrieve chatroom message history.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

Refer to the following code sample:

```objective-c
AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption* option = [[AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption alloc] init];
    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager fetchMessagesFromServerBy:@"conversationId" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeGroupChat cursor:@"" pageSize:20 option:option completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatMessage *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

        }];
```


### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager pinConversation:@"conversationId" isPinned:YES completionBlock:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Pin a message

You can call `AgoraChatManager#pinMessage:completion:` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `MessagePinInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.pinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in pinning messages.
     }
})
```

### Unpin a message

You can call `AgoraChatManager#unpinMessage:completion:` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, `MessagePinInfo` is returned empty and the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.unpinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in unpinning messages.
    }
})
```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `AgoraChatManager#getPinnedMessagesFromServer:completion` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note"><ul><li>If a message expires on the server or the user deletes it unilaterally from the server after pinning, such user will not be able to pull it when pulling roaming messages. However, this user and other users will be able to pull this message from the pinned message list.</li><li>If the user withdraws a message after pinning, the message will be removed from the server; other users will not be able to pull it when they pull the pinned message list from the server.</li></ul></Admonition>

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getPinnedMessages(fromServer: "conversationId", completion: { pinnedMessages, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in getting pinned messages from the server.
    }
})
```

### Get pinned details of a single message

You can call `AgoraChatMessagePinInfo` to get the pinned details of a single message.

- If the message is pinned, this class returns the time of pinning and the user ID of the user who has pinned it.
- If the message is not pinned, this class is returned empty.

```objective-c
if let message = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getMessageWithMessageId("messageId") {
    let pinnedInfo = message.pinnedInfo
}
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

You can use the `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` method to unidirectionally delete historical messages on the server side based on message time or message ID. Up to 50 messages can be deleted at a time. Once deleted, the user cannot retrieve the message from the server. This operation does not affect other users.

Other devices logged in to the account will receive the `MultiDevicesDelegate` callback `multiDevicesMessageBeRemoved`, and the deleted messages will be automatically removed from the device locally.

```objc
// Delete messages by timestamp
[self.conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:message.timestamp completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

}];

// Delete messages by message ID
[self.conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"123314142214"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

}];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```

### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addConversationMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. Each conversation can have up to 20 tags. This feature applies only to private chats and chat groups.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `getConversationsFromServer` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `marks` property.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations per user), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.addConversationMark(["conversationId"], mark: .type0, completion: { err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in marking conversations.
    }
})
```

To use customized tags, use the following code:
```objective-c
NSDictionary* mapping = @{
        @(EMMarkType0): @"important",
        @(EMMarkType1): @"normal",
        @(EMMarkType2): @"unimportant",
        @(EMMarkType3): @"boys",
        @(EMMarkType4): @"girls",
    };
```

### Remove conversation tag

To remove a conversation tag, call `removeConversationMark`. Tags can be removed for up to 20 conversations at a time. Calling this method removes tags from both the local and server-side conversation.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.removeConversationMark(["conversationId"], mark: .type0, completion: { err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in untagging a conversation.
    }
})
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `getConversationsFromServer` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (For an unpinned conversation, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationsFromServer(withCursor: "", filter: AgoraChatConversationFilter(mark: .type0, pageSize: 20), completion: { conversations, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Successfully retrieved conversations by tag.
    }
})
```

### Query local conversations by the conversation tag

For local conversations, you can use the `getAllConversations` method to retrieve all local conversations and then perform  filtering as needed. The following example demonstrates how to query all local conversations marked with `EMMarkType0:`

```objective-c
let markType: AgoraChatMarkType = .type0
let marked0Conversations = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getAllConversations()?.filter { $0.marks.contains(NSNumber(value: markType.rawValue))
}
```

### Get all tags of a local conversation

To retrieve all tags associated with a local conversation, first use the `getConversationWithConvId` method to obtain the local conversation. Then, access the `marks` property of the conversation object to view all its tags. Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating this process:

```objective-c
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationId") {
    let marks = conversation.marks
}
```
