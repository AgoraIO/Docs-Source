Instant messaging enhances user engagement by enabling users to connect and form a community within the app. Increased engagement can lead to increased user satisfaction and loyalty to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. An instant messaging feature can also provide real-time support to users, allowing them to get help and answers to their questions quickly. The <Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to embed real-time messaging in any app, on any device, anywhere.

This page guides you through implementing peer-to-peer messaging into your app using the <Vpd k="SDK"/> for <Vpl k="NAME" />.


## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of sending and receiving peer-to-peer messages using <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

1. Clients retrieve an authentication token from your app server.
1. Users log in to <Vg k="CHAT_SERVER" /> using the app key, their user ID, and token.
1. Clients send and receive messages through <Vg k="CHAT_SERVER" /> as follows:
	1. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to  <Vg k="CHAT_SERVER" />.
	1. The server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives a message, the SDK triggers an event.
	1. Client B listens for the event to read and display the message.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow the procedure on this page, you must have:

- A valid [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> account](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account).
- An [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> project](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-project) for which you have [enabled <Vg k="CHAT" />](enable#enable-).
- The [App Key](enable#get-chat-project-information) for the project.
- Internet access.

	Ensure that no firewall is blocking your network communication.

## Implement peer-to-peer messaging
This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK"/> to implement peer-to-peer messaging in your app, step by step.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

### Next steps

In a production environment, best practice is to deploy your own token server. Users retrieve a token from the token server to log in to  <Vg k="CHAT_SERVER" />. To see how to implement a server that generates and serves tokens on request, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../develop/authentication).
