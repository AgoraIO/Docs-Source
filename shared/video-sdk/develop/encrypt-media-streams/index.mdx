Media stream encryption refers to encrypting audio and video streams in an app using a unique [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) controlled by the app developer. Encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel see and hear each other. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides built-in encryption methods that you can use to guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.

This article describes how to integrate <Vg k="COMPANY" /> built-in media stream encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed={['ios','macos']}>
The following figure illustrates the process of data transfer with media stream encryption enabled. Best practice is to choose the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode and set a key and salt for enhanced security.

The following figure illustrates the process of data transfer with media stream encryption enabled. Best practice is to choose the `AgoraEncryptionModeAES128GCM2` or `AgoraEncryptionModeAES256GCM2` encryption mode and set a [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) for enhanced security.
