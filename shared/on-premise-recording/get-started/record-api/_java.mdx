The Agora server recording SDK supports recording [using the command line](../get-started/record-cmd) and calling the API. Choose a method based on your development scenario. This page shows you how to record by calling the API.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have [integrated the recording SDK](../get-started/integrate-sdk) and copied the following files to your project:

- Compiled `librecording.so` files
- Files in the `bin` folder of the `AgoraCoreService` SDK package.
- Java files in the SDK package, located in the `samples/java/src/io/agora/recording` folder:
    - `RecordingEventHandler.java`
    - `RecordingSDK.java`
    - `/common/Common.java`
    - `/common/RecordingConfig.java`
    - `/common/RecordingEngineProperties.java`

For example, if the top-level directory of your project is `ROOT_DIR`, copy the `librecording.so` files to the `ROOT_DIR/lib` folder, `AgoraCoreService` to the `ROOT_DIR/bin` folder, and the Java files to the` ROOT_DIR/src/io/agora/recording` folder.

When running the Java program, set the `-Djava.library.path=ROOT_DIR/lib` parameter to specify the directory address of the dynamic library. Additionally, set the `appliteDir` parameter in `RecordingConfig` to `ROOT_DIR/bin` when you start recording.

## Implement recording

Call the following methods to start and stop recording:

### Join a channel and start recording

Call the `createChannel` method with the following parameters to create and join a channel, and then start recording.

- `appId`: The App ID of the project. This must be the same as the App ID you passed to the <Vg k="VSDK" />.
- `channelKey`: If the channel to be recorded uses a token, pass the token in this parameter. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/on-premise-recording/develop/authentication-workflow) for details.
- `name`: (required) The name of the channel to be recorded.
- `uid`: (required) The user ID used for recording. A 32-bit unsigned integer, ranging from 1 to (2<sup>32</sup>-1); must be unique.
- `config`: (optional) Recording configuration parameters. If not filled in, the default configuration is used. See `RecordingConfig` for details.

By default, after the recording instance joins a channel, it starts recording when it detects users in the channel.

If `triggerMode` is set to `MANUALLY_MODE` in `RecordingConfig`, call `startService` to start recording. After you start recording, you can call `stopService` to stop recording.

### Get the recording file path
After joining the channel, call `getProperties` to get the storage path of the recording file. The `onUserJoined` callback, triggered when a user joins the channel, also returns the storage path of the recording file.

### End recording

After recording is complete, call `leaveChannel` to leave the channel and stop recording.

<Admonition type="info">
To start recording again after recording is complete, create and join the channel again.
</Admonition>

By default, when the channel is idle (no user in the channel) for more than 300 seconds, the recording instance automatically exits the channel and stops recording. You can modify this time interval by setting the `idleLimitSec` parameter in `RecordingConfig`.

## Reference

Refer to the following documents for additional information and troubleshooting:

- After recording is complete, use the transcoding script to synthesize the recorded files. For details, see [Use transcoding scripts](../develop/transcoding-scripts).
- To learn how to record using the command line, refer to [Recording using the command line](../get-started/record-cmd).
- If the recording file or status is abnormal, refer to [Recording file issues](/help/quality-issues/record_file_issue) and [Recording status errors](/help/quality-issues/record_status_error) to identify and troubleshoot the problem.
