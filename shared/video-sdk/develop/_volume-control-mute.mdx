This article explains how to configure the volume settings for audio collection and playback, as well as for the playback of music files.
</ProductWrapper>

## Understand the tech

The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK supports adjusting the audio volume for both collection and playback to meet the practical application scenarios of users. For example, during a two-person call, if there is a need to mute the remote user, the playback volume can be adjusted to set the volume to 0.

The figure below shows the workflow of adjusting the volume.

### Playback
**Playback** refers to the process in which the audio signal enters from the sending end to the receiving end and is then played back using a playback device.

### In-Ear Monitoring
**In-ear monitoring** refers to the process of audio being collected by the playback

### Acquisition 
**Acquisition** refers to the process in which audio signals are collected by the acquisition device and then transmitted to the transmitter.
