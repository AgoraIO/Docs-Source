## Understand the tech

When you create a local audio or video track, select the capture device by specifying the `cameraId` or `microphoneId`.

<Vpd k="SDK" /> also supports dynamically switching audio and video capture devices after creating a track through `CameraVideoTrack.setDevice` and `MicrophoneAudioTrack.setDevice`. Refer to the following code:

```js
// Switch camera
videoTrack.setDevice("<NEW_DEVICE_ID>").then(() => {
  console.log("set device success");
}).catch(e => {
  console.log("set device error", e);
});
```

Where `videoTrack` refers to the local video track you created using `AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack`.

You can call `setDevice` to change the audio or video capture device even after publishing a track. However, on certain mobile devices, this operation may fail due to hardware or browser limitations.

## Hot-swap capture devices

<Vpd k="SDK" /> provides the `onMicrophoneChanged` and `onCameraChanged` callbacks to monitor changes in the plug-in status of audio and video devices. To automatically switch to a newly connected device, implement listeners for these callbacks and invoke the corresponding `setDevice` function to use the audio or video capture device.

```javascript
AgoraRTC.onMicrophoneChanged = async (changedDevice) => {
  // When a new device is detected, switch to the new device
  if (changedDevice.state === "ACTIVE") {
    microphoneTrack.setDevice(changedDevice.device.deviceId);
  } else if (changedDevice.device.label === microphoneTrack.getTrackLabel()) {
    // Switch to an existing device when the unplugged device is the current device
    const oldMicrophones = await AgoraRTC.getMicrophones();
    oldMicrophones[0] && microphoneTrack.setDevice(oldMicrophones[0].deviceId);
  }
};

AgoraRTC.onCameraChanged = async (changedDevice) => {
  // When a new device is detected, switch to the new device
  if (changedDevice.state === "ACTIVE") {
    cameraTrack.setDevice(changedDevice.device.deviceId);
  } else if (changedDevice.device.label === cameraTrack.getTrackLabel()) {
    // Switch to an existing device when the unplugged device is the current device
    const oldCameras = await AgoraRTC.getCameras();
    oldCameras[0] && cameraTrack.setDevice(oldCameras[0].deviceId);
  }
};
```

<Admonition type="caution">
If the user adds a virtual or a faulty device, hot-swap routing logic may result in no picture or no sound when the device is plugged-in or unplugged.
