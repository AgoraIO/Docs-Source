## v4.1.0 Beta 1

v4.1.0 Beta 1 was released on February 27, 2023.

This release is the first version of RTC Unreal SDK, including the following features:

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `IRtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions.`

- After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
- You can simultaneously publish multiple sets of video streams captured by multiple cameras or screen sharing by setting `publishSecondaryCameraTrack` and `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions`.

This release adds `createCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured video in the channel:

1. Create a custom video track: Call this method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
2. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.
3. Pushing an external video source: Call `pushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in step 2 in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
- Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**2. Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and now supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes.

Additionally, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 × 2160) and the frame rate to 60 fps when calling `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

> **Note**: This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To experience this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.

**3. Build-in media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.


**4. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function in the following ways.

- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as true.
- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method after joining a channel, and then call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as true.


**5. Spatial audio**

  > **Note**: This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:sales-us@agora.io ">sales@agora.io</a>. Contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a> if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the remote user.

You can also set the spatial audio for the media player as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.

This release also adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense of presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listner experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user, respectively, by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation paramter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`, and the receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the hearing of the headphones.

**6. Media Stream Encryption**

This release adds support for media stream encryption, which encrypts your app’s audio and video streams with a unique key and salt controlled by the app developer. While not every use case requires media encryption, Agora provides the option to guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.


 **7. Media push**

This release adds support for sending the audio and video of your channel to other RTMP servers through the CDN:
- Starts or stops publishing at any time.
- Adds or removes an address while continuously publishing the stream.
- Adjusts the picture-in-picture layout.
- To send a live stream to WeChat or Weibo.
- To allow more people to watch the live stream when the number of audience members in the channel reached the limit.


**8. Brand-new AI noise reduction**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (in comparison to the basic AI noise reduction in v3.7.0). The new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option.

**9. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS` enumeration in `AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

**10. Extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace**

In order to enhance the real-time audio and video interactive activities based on the Agora SDK, this release supports the one-stop solution for the extensions from the [Agora extensions marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/marketplace):

- Easy to integrate: The integration of modular functions can be achieved simply by calling an API, and the integration efficiency is improved by nearly 95%.
- Extensibility design: The modular and extensible SDK design style endows the Agora SDK with good extensibility, which enables developers to quickly build real-time interactive apps based on the Agora extensions marketplace ecosystem.
- Build an ecosystem: A community of real-time audio and video apps has developed that can accommodate a wide range of developers, offering a variety of extension combinations. After integrating the extensions, developers can build richer real-time interactive functions.
- Become a vendor: Vendors can integrate their products with Agora SDK in the form of extensions, display and publish them in the Agora extensions marketplace, and build a real-time interactive ecosystem for developers together with Agora. For details on how to develop and publish extensions.

**11. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.


**12. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your whitelist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blacklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `IRtcEngineEx` interface:

- `SetSubscribeAudioBlacklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeAudioWhitelist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoBlacklist`：Set the video subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoWhitelist`：Set the video subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blacklist and a whitelist at the same time, only the blacklist takes effect.


**13. Replace video feeds with images**

This release supports replacing video feeds with images when publishing video streams. You can call the enableVideoImageSource method to enable this function and choose your own images through the options parameter. If you disable this function, the remote users see the video feeds that you publish.

**14. Local video mixing**

This release adds a series of APIs supporting local video mixing functions. You can mix multiple video streams into one video stream locally. Common scenarios are as follows:

- In interactive live streaming scenarios with cohosts or when using the Media Push function, you can merge the screens of multiple hosts into one view locally.
- In scenarios where you capture multiple local video streams (for example, video captured by cameras, screen sharing streams, video files or pictures), you can and merge them into one video stream and then publish the mixed video stream in the channel.

You can call the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to start local video mixing and call the `stopLocalVideoTranscoder` method to stop local video mixing. After the local video mixing starts, you can call `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` to update the local video mixing configuration.

**15. Video device management**

Video capture devices can support multiple video formats, each supporting a different combination of video frame width, video frame height, and frame rate.

This release adds the `numberOfCapabilities` and `getCapability` methods for getting the number of video formats supported by the video capture device and the details of the video frames in the specified video format. When calling the `startPrimaryCameraCapture` or `startSecondaryCameraCapture` method to capture video using the camera, you can use the specified video format.

> **Note**: The SDK automatically selects the best video format for the video capture device based on your settings in <code>VideoEncoderConfiguration</code>, so normally you should not need to use these new methods.

**16. In-ear monitoring**


This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

After successfully enabling the in-ear monitoring function, you can call `registerAudioFrameObserver` to register the audio observer, and the SDK triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback to report the audio frame data. You can use your own audio effect processing module to pre-process the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. Agora recommends that you choose one of the following two methods to set the audio data format of the in-ear monitoring:

- Call the `setEarMonitoringAudioFrameParameters` method to set the audio data format of in-ear monitoring. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the parameters in this method, and triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.
- Set the audio data format in the return value of the `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the return value of the callback, and triggers the onEarMonitoringAudioFrame callback based on the sampling interval.

> **Note**: To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call <code>setInEarMonitoringVolume</code>.


**17. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports 3 audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; you can contact support@agora.io to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Meanwhile, Agora supports publishers to choose whether or not the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered will bypass this filter mechanism and transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios where there are a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reducing the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.


> **Note**: To enable this function, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.

**18. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.
