### Add an event listener

<Vg k="SIG"/> uses an `IRtmEventHandler` instance to process messages and event notifications. Each message and event notification has a corresponding event handler, where you implement your own processing logic. Refer to the following code to create and use an instance of `IRtmEventHandler`:

```cpp
class RtmHandler: public IRtmEventHandler {
    void onMessageEvent(const MessageEvent &event) {}
    void onTopicEvent(const TopicEvent &event) {}
    void onConnectionStateChanged(const char *channelName, RTM_CONNECTION_STATE state, RTM_CONNECTION_CHANGE_REASON reason) {}
    void onLoginResult(RTM_ERROR_CODE errorCode) {
        if (errorCode != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
            printf("login rtm failed error is %d reason is %s\n", errorCode, getErrorReason(errorCode));
        } else {
            printf("login rtm success\n");
        }
    }
    void onStorageEvent(const StorageEvent &event) {}
    void onLockEvent(const LockEvent &event) {}
}

RtmConfig cfg;
cfg.appId = "your_appid";
cfg.userId = "your_name";
// Specify the event listener in the client configuration
cfg.eventHandler = new RtmHandler();

// Create an IRtmClient instance
IRtmClient* rtm_client = createAgoraRtmClient();
int ret = rtm_client->initialize(cfg);
```

### Remove event listeners

To avoid performance degradation caused by memory leaks, errors, and null pointer exceptions, best practice is to unregister the event handler when you no longer need to use it. For example, if you don't want to use the `void onLockEvent(const LockEvent &event) {}` event, just delete the definition of the function.

### Signaling events

<Vpd k="SDK" /> offers the following events:  

| Event Listener | Description  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| `onMessageEvent`| Receive message notifications from all the message channels you have subscribed to, or topic message notifications subscribed to from all the stream channels you have joined.  |
| `onPresenceEvent`  | Receive online status event notifications from remote users in all the message channels you have subscribed to and stream channels you have joined. |
| `onTopicEvent`  | Receive notifications of topic change events in all the stream channels you have joined. |
| `onStorageEvent`| Receive all channel metadata event notifications in all message channels you have subscribed to and stream channels you have joined, as well as user metadata event notifications from all subscribed users. |
| `onLockEvent`| Receive all lock event notifications in the message channels you have subscribed to and stream channels you have joined.  |
| `onConnectionStateChanged`| Receive event notifications for client network connection status changes.  |
| `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` | Receive event notifications that the client token is about to expire.   |

For details on the parameters passed in by each event, refer to [Event listeners](../reference/api?#event-listeners) in the API reference.
