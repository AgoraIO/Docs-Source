## Play audio files

The media player functionality was not implemented in this version of the Web <Vpd k="SDK" />. Use the following method to implement playing audio files in a channel.

1. **Update the user interface** 
    
    In this simple example, you add a button to the user interface to play an audio file. To add the button, in `index.html`, add the following code after `<button type="button" id="leave">Leave</button>`:

    ```html
    <button type="button" id="playAudioFile">Play audio file</button>
    ```

1. **Add an audio file to your project**

    Create a `resources` folder in your project and copy an audio file to the folder in one of the following formats:

    - MP3
    - AAC
    - Other audio formats supported by the browser

1. **Create an audio track from a source file**

    When a user presses the button, you create an audio track by calling the `createBufferSourceAudioTrack` method. To do this, add the following code to `main.js`:

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("playAudioFile").onclick =
    async function localPlayerStart() {
        
        // Create an audio track from a source file
        const track = await AgoraRTC.createBufferSourceAudioTrack({
            source: "./resources/<your audio file.mp3>",
        });
    };
    ```

1. **Play the audio track**

    To publish and play the audio track, add the following code to `localPlayerStart()` after you create the audio track:

    ```javascript
    // Play the track
    track.startProcessAudioBuffer({loop: false});
    track.play();
    ```
