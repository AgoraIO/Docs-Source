1. Before joining a channel, call `AgoraRTCClient.enableDualStream` on the host to activate dual stream mode.

2. On the receiving end, call `AgoraRTCClient.setStreamFallbackOption` to configure the fallback behavior for receiving media streams and set the `fallbackType` parameter to one of the following values:

   - `LOW_STREAM: = 1`: Automatically subscribe to the low-video stream under poor network conditions.

   - `AUDIO_ONLY: = 2`: Subscribe to the low-quality video stream when the network conditions worsen, and subscribe to audio only when the conditions become too poor to support video transmission.

   Additionally, when dual-stream mode is enabled on the host, the audience can call the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method to specify receiving only the low resolution video stream by setting `streamType` to `1`.

4. During the session, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-fallback")` callback when a remote video stream falls back to an audio stream or switches back to video after the network conditions improve, providing users with information regarding the current stream reception status. Similarly, the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-type-changed")` callback is triggered when the remote video stream switches between high and low resolutions.

In the following sample code, `client` refers to the local client object created using `AgoraRTC.createClient`.

- **Host configuration**
  
    Enable dual stream mode

    ```javascript
    client.enableDualStream().then(() => {
      console.log("Enable dual stream success!")
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log(err)
    });
    ```

- **Audience configuration**

    - In a weak network environment, first attempt to receive the low resolution stream; if video display is not feasible due to poor network conditions, only the audio stream is received.

        ```javascript
        // Set fallback option to low resolution video or audio-only
        client.setStreamFallbackOption(remoteUid, 2)
        ```

    - To ensure call quality, you can also manually switch the subscribed video stream to low resolution.

        ```javascript
        // Manually switch to low resolution
        client.setRemoteVideoStreamType(remoteUid, 1);
        ```
