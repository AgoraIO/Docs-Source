Use <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. <Vg k="SIG" /> also helps you enhance the user experience in <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" /> applications.

This page shows you how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to rapidly build a simple application that sends and receives messages. It shows you how to integrate the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project and implement pub/sub messaging. For information and implementation details about stream channels, where users communicate using topics in a channel, see [Stream channels](../core-functionality/stream-channel).

## Understand the tech

Pub/sub is the simplest form of messaging. <Vg k="SIG" /> creates a channel when a user subscribes to it. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for events which contain messages users publish to a channel.

You use an authentication token to authenticate a user with <Vg k="SIG" /> and join a channel. Each token is bound to a single user ID. To create a pub/sub session for <Vg k="SIG" />, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

### Token authentication

In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from a [Token Generator](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/). To understand how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow#implement-the-authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/get-started/integrate-token-generation).
