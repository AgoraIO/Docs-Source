You can subscribe to the following <Vg k="MPULL" /> events from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />:

| eventType | Event name|  Description |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| `1` | [Player Created](#player-created) | Cloud player successfully created. |
| `3` | [Player Destroyed](#player-destroyed) | Cloud player destroyed. |
| `4` | [Player Status Changed](#player-status-changed) | State of the cloud player changed at runtime. |

#### **Player Created**

When you successfully create a cloud player by calling the `Create` API, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends a notification for this event to your server.

The `eventType` is `1(Player Created)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
   "lts":1575508644149,
   "player":{
      "channelName":"class32",
      "createTs":1575508644,
      "id":"2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
      "idleTimeout":300,
      "name":"teacher101",
      "status":"connecting",
      "streamUrl":"rtmp://example.agora.io/live/class32/teacher101",
      "token":"2a784467d6",
      "uid":101
   },
   "xRequestId":"7bbcc8a4acce48c78b53c5a261a8a564"
}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields:
  - `channelName`: String. The name of the Agora channel.
  - `createTs`: Number. The Unix timestamp (in seconds) when creating the cloud player.
  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `idleTimeout`: Number. The maximum length of time (in seconds) that the cloud player is idle. The "idle" state means that the media stream is not playing. When the idle state exceeds `idleTimeout`, the cloud player is automatically destroyed.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
  - `streamUrl`: String. The RTMP URL of the online media stream.
  - `token`: String. The authentication token used by the cloud player in the channel.
  - `uid`: Number. The User ID of the cloud player in the channel.
  - `account`: String. The User Account of the cloud player in the Agora channel.
  - `status`: String. The state of the cloud player at runtime:
    - `"connecting"`: Agora's server is connecting to the address of the media stream or detecting the audio and video data.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `xRequestId`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify this request. It is the same as the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header.

#### **Player Destroyed**

When the cloud player is destroyed, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends a notification for this event to your server. The reason for destruction is mentioned in the `destroyReason` field.

The `eventType` is `3(Player Destroyed)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
   "destroyReason":"Delete Request",
   "fields":"player.name,player.channelName,player.id",
   "lts":1575508644149,
   "player":{
      "channelName":"class32",
      "id":"2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
      "name":"teacher101"
   }
}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields:
  - `channelName`: String. The name of the Agora channel.
  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `destroyReason`: String. The reason why the cloud player is destroyed:
  - `Delete Request`: You call the `Delete` API to successfully destroy the cloud player.
  - `Internal Error`: The error occurs when setting the parameters and fields related to the Agora channel, such as the `token` is invalid or expires.
  - `Idle Timeout`: Within the specified `idleTimeout`, Agora's server for the cloud player function cannot connect the address of the media stream or the media stream cannot be played.
  - `Stream Stopped`: Media stream playback ends.
- `fields`: String. The field mask to represent a set of symbolic field paths. The field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are separated by a comma. It specifies a subset of fields that should be returned. In the sample code, `fields` specifies to return the `name`, `channelName`, and `id` fields.

#### **Player Status Changed**

When the state of the cloud player at runtime changes, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends a notification for this event to your server.

The `eventType` is `4(Player Status Changed)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
  "player": {
    "channelName": "class32",
    "id": "2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
    "name": "teacher101",
    "status": "running"
  },

}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields:

  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
  - `status`: String. The state of the cloud player at runtime:
    - `"connecting"`: Agora server for the cloud player function is connecting to the address of the media stream or detecting the audio and video data.
    - `"success"`: Agora server is successfully connected to the address of the media stream.
    - `"running"`: Playing.
    - `"failed"`: Agora's server cannot connect to the address of the media stream, or the media stream cannot be played.
    - `stopped`: Media stream playback ends.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `fields`ï¼šString. The field mask to represent a set of symbolic field paths. The field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are separated by a comma. It specifies a subset of fields that should be returned. In the sample code,`fields` specifies to return the `name`, `channelName`, `id` and `status` fields.
