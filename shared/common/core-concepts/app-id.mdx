#### App ID

The App ID is a random string generated within <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> when you create a new project. You can create multiple projects in your account; each project has a different App ID. This App ID enables your app users to communicate securely with each other. When you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, you pass the App ID as an argument. The App ID is also used to create the authentication tokens that ensure secure communication in a channel. You <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">retrieve your App ID</Link> using <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses this App ID to identify each app, provide billing and other statistical data services.

Without an authentication token, your environment is open to anyone with access to your App ID.
