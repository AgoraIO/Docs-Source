## v2.16.37

v2.16.37 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Whiteboard tool updates**

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Ellipse: Press the `Alt` or `option` button to draw a circle with the cursor as the center.
- Pencil:
  - Draw straight lines: The user can press `shift` to draw a straight line.
  - Draw dotted lines: Add `dottedLine: true` in `room.memberState` to enable this feature.
  - Writing performance: Adds support for adjusting the balance between the performance and the quality of the pencil
  tool by modifying the `NewPencilWritingQuality` enum.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by adding `textCanSelectText: true` in `room.memberState`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Screenshot to canvas**

This release adds the `screenshotToCanvas` method to take a screenshot and write it to canvas.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The recall and redo function sometimes got reset after the user switched pages or reconnected.
- Some fields in `room.setMemberState()` could not be saved locally.
- The `floatBar` did not work properly on some touch devices.

#### API changes

**Added**

- New properties in the `MemberState` class: `dottedLine` and `textCanSelectText`
- `NewPencilWritingQuality`
- `screenshotToCanvas`
- New value in the `ApplianceNames` enum: `pencilEraser`

## v2.16.24

v2.16.24 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Text editing**

To support custom text editing options, this release adds the following APIs.

- `insertText`: Inserts text at a specified position.
- `updateText`: Modifies the specified text.
- `updateSelectedText`: Modifies the font style of the currently selected text, including font size, color, bold style, and italic style.

You can use these APIs to customize the text input box and editing toolbar.

This release also adds the `textColor`, `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, and `lineThrough` properties to `MemberState` to provide richer text editing options. When you use the `text` tool provided by the Whiteboard SDK but want to customize the text editing toolbar, you can set the `floatBar` property in `JoinRoomParams` as `false` and edit the text using the new properties in `MemberState`.

<div class="alert note">This release deletes the <code>updateTextFontSize</code> method. Instead, you can use <code>updateSelectedText</code> or <code>textSize</code> in <code>MemberState</code>.</div>

**2. Image rotation**

This release adds the `disableRotation` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable image rotation. The SDK enables image rotation by default, which allows users to rotate the selected image by any angle. If you want to disable the rotation, you can set `disableRotation(true)`.

**3. Tween animation**

This release adds the tween animation feature for the `pencil` tool. When a user draws or writes with the pencil, the SDK automatically inserts frames between keyframes so that to remote users see a smoother drawing process, but this feature increases latency.

This release also adds the `disableCurveAnimes` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` for enabling or disabling the the tween animation feature. The tween animation feature is enabled in the SDK by default. To disable it, you can set `disableCurveAnimes(true)`.

<div class="alert note">Tween animations take effect only when <code>disableNewPencil</code> is set as <code>false</code>.</div>

**4. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `disableNewPencilStroke` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of `disableNewPencilStroke` is `true`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you set `disableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `disableNewPencil(false)`, you can call `disableNewPencilStroke(true)`.

<div class="alert note">The stroke effect takes effect only when <code>disableNewPencil</code> is set as <code>false</code>.</div>

**5. Getting the scene information**

This release adds the `getScene` method to the `Displayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

**6. Scene callbacks**

This release adds the `createScenesCallback` method for creating a listener object for a scene directory. After the listener object is successfully created, when the scenes and subdirectories in the specified scene directory change, the SDK triggers the callbacks you have registered in `ScenesCallbacks` to report the scene events.

**7. Reporting exceptions that occur when playing the media file in a dynamic PPT slide**

This release adds the `onPPTMediaPlayError` callback to report exceptions that occur during the playing of the media file in a dynamic PPT slide.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Optimizes the writing performance on Android browsers.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- Rendering exceptions and errors occurred when using the SDK on an early version of React.
- The virtual keyboard did not pop up when clicking `text` on iOS browsers.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.
