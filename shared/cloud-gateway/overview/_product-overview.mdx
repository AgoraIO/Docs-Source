Deployed on your server, the Agora <Vpd k="NAME" /> communicates with clients integrated with the [Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />](../reference/glossary#agora-video-sdk). You can use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> to transmit video and audio streams between the server and the client through [SD-RTN™](../reference/glossary#agora-sd-rtn).

The following diagram shows typical application scenarios of the <Vpd k="NAME" />, including playing local media files, pushing streams to CDN, and communicating with enterprise call centers. The <Vpd k="NAME" /> implements media stream transmission by the following means:

- Converting incoming media streams from SD&#8209;RTN™ to a specified format.
- Encoding and sending local media streams to SD&#8209;RTN™.

<div class="alert note">When you use the <a href="../reference/glossary#agora-video-sdk">Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /></a> to communicate with the <Vpd k="NAME" />, set the channel scenario of the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to <code>LIVE_BROADCASTING</code>.</div>

<div class="alert note">The <Vpd k="NAME" /> does not support SIP transcoding.</div>

## Advantages

The Gateway Server SDK has the following advantages:

| Feature  | Description                                                         |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reliability   | Supports cluster deployment, dynamic scalability, and high availability.                         |
| Smoothness  | Low-latency media transmission from the server to the client based on the packet loss reduction feature of SD-RTN™.  |
| High concurrency | You can simultaneously send and receive hunderds of video streams.|
| Security   | Provides end-to-end security measures for video and audio chat, data transmission, and storage. See [Information Security Policy](../reference/security). |

## Platform Compatibility

The Gateway Server SDK supports the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu (14.04 or higher)
- CentOS (6.6 or higher)

The Gateway Server SDK supports the following architectures:

- arm64
- x86-64

If you need to use the SDK on other architectures, contact sales@agora.io.

## Application scenarios

The Gateway Server SDK supports the following scenarios:

|  Scenario    | Description                                                     |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI interactive class | An AI interactive class is a custom online class that uses AI to analyze student performance and recommend appropriate video class content. You use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> to send different video content to different user IDs in a channel. |
| Network test | Prior to the start of an online class, you use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> to join the channel as a robot to test the end-to-end network status by communicating with teachers and students. |
| Call center    | You use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> to create audio connections for traditional enterprise call centers (VoIP/PTSN). Users can conveniently call customer service from an app. |

## Functions

The Gateway Server SDK supports the following functions:

| Function                           | Description                                                         |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sending and receiving audio and video data in various formats.	 | Supports sending and receiving audio and video data in various formats. See [Send and Receive Media streams](../develop/send-receive-media-streams). |
| Independent audio/video and sending/receiving processes.     | You can send and receive media streams simultaneously, or choose to only send or receive audio or video streams. |
| Using user ID in string format to join a channel.              | Supports joining a channel with a user ID in string format. See [Using String User ID](../develop/stringuid). |
| Specifying remote streams by user ID.           | Supports receiving media streams from a specified user ID.                               |
| Starting a single process with multiple SDK instances.                 | Supports sending and/or receiving media streams to and from multiple channels simultaneously.                       |
| Audio mixing.                           | Supports mixing multiple audio streams.                              |
| Media encryption. | Supports media encryption. See [Media Encryption](../develop/media-stream-encryption).  |
| Cloud proxy. | Supports cloud proxy service. You need to add specified IPs and ports to your firewall allowlist to access Agora services from restricted networks. See [Cloud Proxy](../develop/cloud-proxy).|
| Network Geofencing | Supports network geofencing. After enabling geofencing, the Agora SDK only connects to Agora servers within the specified region. See [Network Geofencing](../develop/network-geofencing).|
