## v4.0.0-beta.1

v4.0.0-beta.1 was released on April 11, 2022.

### Compatibility changes

This release has optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v3.6.2. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:
- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Custom video capture and renderer (Media IO)
- Error codes and warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to the business scenarios. For details, see [Migration guide](../develop/migration-guide).

### New features

**1. Extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace**

In order to enhance the real-time audio and video interactive activities based on the Agora SDK, this release supports the one-stop solution for the extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace:

-   Easy to integrate: The integration of modular functions can be achieved simply by calling an API, and the integration efficiency is improved by nearly 95%.

-   Extensibility design: The modular and extensible SDK design style endows the Agora SDK with good extensibility, which enables developers to quickly build real-time interactive apps based on the Agora extensions marketplace ecosystem.

-   Build an ecosystem: A community of real-time audio and video apps has developed that can accommodate a wide range of developers, offering a variety of extension combinations. After integrating the extensions, developers can build richer real-time interactive functions. For details, see [Integrate an Extension into your app](../develop/use-an-extension).

-   Become a vendor: Vendors can integrate their products with Agora SDK in the form of extensions, display and publish them in the Agora extensions marketplace, and build a real-time interactive ecosystem for developers together with Agora. For details on how to develop and publish extensions, see [Become a Vendor](../../extensions-marketplace/develop/vendor-workflow).

**2. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `RtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users, adapting to various business scenarios, including the following:

-   Simultaneously publish a video stream from a media player, a screen sharing stream, a video stream captured by the front camera and the rear camera.

-   Simultaneously publish the audio stream captured by a single-channel microphone, self-captured, and the audio stream of the media player.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

-   Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).

-   Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

-   Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**3. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

-   Sets or switches the release of multiple audio and video sources.

-   Sets or switches channel profile and user role.

-   Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.

-   Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to actively subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.

**4. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK’s package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

**5. Streaming module**

This release introduces the streaming module that supports the SDK directly pushing media streams published by the hosts to a CDN. During this process, media streams are pushed in the RTMP protocol, and you can set the video and audio profiles according to your scenarios. The streaming module also supports media enhancement supplementary information (SEI), customizing the live streaming watermark, and adjusting video encoder configurations based on your network conditions. You can try this feature in live streaming events where there is only one host, such as fashion show, game, and e-commerce live streaming.

**6. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

-   Two or more choruses are supported.

-   Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.

-   Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the following APIs to set extremely low latency:

-   The `getAudioDeviceInfo` method

-   The `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS` enumeration in `AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE`

You need to call `getAudioDeviceInfo` first to get whether the audio device supports ultra-low-latency capture and playback. As long as the audio device supports ultra-low latency `(isLowLatencyAudioSupported = true)`, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus after setting `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS`.

**7. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `ULTRA_HIGH_QUALITY_VOICE` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**8. Stereo processing**

In scenarios that require enhanced realism, such as concerts, local users might need to capture stereo audio and send stereo signals to remote users.
To meet the requirement for stereo audio, this release adds the `setAdvancedAudioOptions` method. Agora recommends the following settings:

1.  Preprocessing: Call `setAdvancedAudioOptions`, and set `audioProcessingChannels` to `AUDIO_PROCESSING_STEREO(2)` in `AdvancedAudioOptions`.

2.  Post-processing: Call `setAudioProfile`, and set profile to `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD_STEREO(3)` or `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO(5)`.

### Improvements

1.  **Fast channel switching**

    This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannel` in v3.6.2 by switching channels through `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel`, without additionally calling `switchChannel`.

2.  **External video source**

    This release adds the `pushExternalEncodedVideoFrame` method and the `sourceType` parameter in the `setExternalVideoSource` method, so that you can push the encoded external video data to the SDK.

3.  **Voice pitch of the local user**

    This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user’s voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.
