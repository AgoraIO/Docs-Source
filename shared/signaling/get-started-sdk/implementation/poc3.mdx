1.  **Declare the variables to hold a <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance**

    You use these objects to communicate with <Vg k="SIG" />.

    <EngineInstance />

1.  **Declare configuration variables**

    Best practice is to keep these variables separate from your code. For example, in the <Vg k="SIG" /> reference app, we use the following `JSON` configuration file.

    <DeclareVariables />

3.  **Configure a <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance**

    Your code reads the parameters from the configuration file, initializes the SignalingEngine instance and adds the event listeners.

    <ConfigureEngine/>

4.  **Handle and respond to  <Vg k="SIG" /> events**
    <a id="handle-events"></a>

    <RespondToEvents/>
    
1.  **Login to <Vg k="SIG" />**

    In <Vg k="SIG" />, each token is specific to a user ID. If `uid` and `token` do not match, your user cannot initiate <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" />.

    <Login/>    

1. **Subscribe to a channel**

    To start receiving messages and event notifications from a channel, you call `subscribe`.

    <Subscribe/>

1.  **Send a message**

    Messages are sent directly to a channel.

    <Publish/>

    You setup the event handlers for messages received from other users during <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> initiation.

1. **Unsubscribe from a channel**

    When you no longer need to receive channel notifications, call `unsubscribe`.

    <Unsubscribe/>

1.  **Logout of <Vg k="SIG" />**

    Had enough of the conversation? Just logout.

    <Logout/>

You have just implemented the <Vg k="SIG" /> workflow. Yes, it's as easy as that.
