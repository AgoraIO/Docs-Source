  Use TEN Designer for customizing and debugging AI Agents in the TEN Framework.
---

TEN Framework provides a flexible architecture with support for the TEN Cloud Store, package management, multiple programming languages, and cross-platform deployment. These features enable advanced customization of AI Agents but may involve a steeper learning curve and higher technical proficiency.

To streamline development, TEN Framework includes a command-line tool called TEN Manager. This tool enables direct configuration and customization of AI Agents built with the framework.

For users who prefer a graphical interface, TEN Manager also integrates TEN Designer, a web-based visual development environment. TEN Designer provides tools for creating, editing, and debugging TEN Apps and TEN Extensions within a browser-based UI.

Installing TEN Manager provides access to both the command-line interface and the TEN Designer UI, forming a complete development environment for working with the TEN Framework.

You can download TEN Designer from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten_framework/releases).

TEN Designer supports the following operating systems and architectures. Use the appropriate version for your platform:

- Windows
  - x86_64
- Linux
  - x86_64
- MacOS
  - x86_64
  - arm64

After downloading and extracting, use the following command to start TEN Designer:

```shell
tman designer
```

You can execute this command in the root directory of any TEN App or from another location. If executed in the root directory of a TEN App, TEN Designer loads that app by default. You can also manually load any TEN App in TEN Designer.

Starting TEN Designer in the root directory of a TEN App is not required, but it simplifies the process of manually loading an app.

After startup, TEN Designer displays output similar to the following, indicating that it runs on the default port, `49483`:

```text
üèÜ  Starting server at http://0.0.0.0:49483
```

To interact with TEN Designer, use the following URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:49483/
```

## Working with TEN apps

This section guides you through working with TEN apps in the TEN designer.

### Load an existing TEN app

Load an existing TEN App using the **Load App** button in the **App** menu. After clicking the button, you see the following interface:

![Loading an Existing TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_load_app.png)

To load an existing TEN App, use the file browser to specify the app's root directory.

### Manage loaded TEN apps

To manage loaded TEN apps, use the **Manage Loaded App(s)** button in the **App** menu. Click the button to open the following **Apps Manager** interface:

![Managing Loaded TEN Apps](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_manage_loaded_apps.png)

You can use this dialog to:

- Unload loaded TEN Apps
- Reload specified TEN Apps
- Reload all loaded TEN Apps
- Install all dependencies for specified Apps
- Run functions for specific Apps

### Installing dependencies for an app

Use the **Apps Manager** to install various TEN packages in a TEN app. The `manifest.json` file records all TEN packages that a TEN App depends on. Following is an example of a `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "type": "app",
  "name": "aaa",
  "version": "0.8.18",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime",
      "version": "0.8.18"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_muxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_demuxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_client",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "protocol",
      "name": "msgpack",
      "version": "^0.8.18"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python3 tools/run_script.py start",
    "build": "python3 tools/run_script.py build"
  }
}
```

The sample configuration shows that this TEN App depends on the following TEN packages:

- `ten_runtime`: The system package of TEN Framework
- `ffmpeg_demuxer`: A TEN Extension package for decoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_muxer`: A TEN Extension package for encoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_client`: A TEN Extension package for processing audio and video using the other two ffmpeg extension packages
- `msgpack`: A TEN Protocol package for message serialization and deserialization using the MessagePack protocol

After installation of all dependencies for this TEN App, the TEN package file structure in the system is as follows:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_client
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_demuxer
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_muxer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protocol
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ msgpack
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_runtime
```

It's worth noting that even though it's not explicitly declared in the `manifest.json`, there is an additional `ffmpeg` package in the system. This is because `ffmpeg_demuxer` and `ffmpeg_muxer` depend on the `ffmpeg` system package, and TEN Manager automatically identifies and installs these transitive dependencies.

Through the **Apps Manager** interface in TEN Designer, use the **Install All** operation on a specified app to easily complete the installation of all dependencies. After clicking the button, you see the following interface showing the installation progress:

![Installing All Dependencies for an App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_install_all.png)

### Installing TEN extensions from the Cloud Store

To install TEN extensions to the current TEN app, open the TEN Cloud Store using the **Open Extension Store** button in the **Graph** menu. You see the following interface:

![TEN Cloud Store](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_store.png)

Search for the required TEN extensions and click the **Install** button to install the selected extension to the current TEN App. After installation, you can see the extensions in the current TEN App.

### Running a TEN app

Using the **Apps Manager**, you can perform preset runtime operations on the specified app. After clicking the **Run** button in the **Apps Manager**, you see the following interface:

![Running a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_run.png)

In the dialog, select the preset operation to execute from the dropdown menu. These typically include the following operations:

- Run App: Start the app and display the app's output information in the TEN Designer message window.
- Build App: Compile the app. Since TEN Framework supports multiple programming languages, some languages need to be compiled while others do not. For example, TEN apps developed in C++ need to be compiled, while TEN apps developed in Python do not.

Following is the build interface for a TEN app developed in C++:

![Building a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_build.png)

After the build is complete, continue with the startup operation for the TEN App. The system displays a window showing the TEN app's runtime logs in real-time:

![Starting a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_start.png)

## Working with TEN graphs

### Loading an existing TEN graph

To load an existing TEN graph, use the **Open Existing Graph** button in the **Graph** menu. After the graph loads, you see an interface similar to the following:

![TEN Graph](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_graph_overview.png)

This sample graph contains three TEN Extensions:

- `ffmpeg_demuxer`
- `ffmpeg_muxer`
- `ffmpeg_client`

Each TEN extension has inputs and outputs. For example, `ffmpeg_demuxer` has the following inputs and outputs:

- 2 cmd inputs
- 1 cmd output
- 1 audio_frame output
- 1 video_frame output

Clicking on the number buttons for inputs and outputs opens a dialog similar to the following. Use this interface to manage input and output connections:

![TEN Message Input/Output Dialog](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_msg_info_dialog.png)

### Auto-layout graph

After manually adjusting the positions of TEN extensions in the TEN graph, click the **Auto Layout** button in the **Graph** menu to automatically arrange the TEN extensions in the TEN graph.

### Opening the context menu for TEN extensions

In the graph, right-clicking a TEN extension opens the extension's context menu:

![TEN Extension Context Menu](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_context_menu.png)

The context menu makes it convenient to modify and customize TEN extensions. Using the context menu, you can open the TEN extension's `manifest.json` file, `property.json` file, or directly start a terminal in the root directory of the TEN extension.
