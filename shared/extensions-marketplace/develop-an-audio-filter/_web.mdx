This page shows you how to use the APIs provided by the Agora SDK v4.0.0 to build an audio filter extension for macOS.

## Understand the tech

Agora provides the following abstract classes for developing an audio extension:

- Required basic classes:
 - `AudioExtension`: This class implements initialization-related functions, including creating an extension, setting log reports, and setting event reports.
 - `AudioProcessor`: This class implements audio processing capabilities, including receiving, processing, and delivering audio data.
- Optional auxiliary classes:
 - `Ticker`: This class helps manage periodic tasks.
 - `Logger`: This class uploads logs to the Agora SDK.
 - `Reporter`: This class reports events to the Agora SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- A Windows or macOS computer that meets the following criteria:
   - A browser that matches the [supported browser list](../overview/supported-platforms). Agora highly recommends using [the latest stable version]( https://www.google.com/chrome/) of Google Chrome.
   - Physical media input devices, such as a built-in camera and a built-in microphone.
   - Access to the Internet. If your network has a firewall, follow the instructions in [Firewall Requirements]( ../reference/firewall) to access Agora services.
   - An Intel 2.2GHz Core i3/i5/i7 processor (2nd generation) or equivalent
- [Node.js and npm ](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Project setup

Integrate the extension development module ([agora-rte-extension ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-rte-extension)) into your project via npm:

1. To install the required module, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install --save agora-rte-extension
   ```

2. To import the required module, add the following code to your `.js` file:

   ```
   import {AudioExtension, AudioProcessor} from 'agora-rte-extension'
   ```

## Develop an audio extension

This section introduces the APIs you must implement in order to develop an audio extension. Optionally, based on the actual needs, you can implement certain auxiliary APIs to optimize the design and performance of your extension. For details, refer to [See also](#ref).



### Sample project




Agora provides a Web sample project [ExtensionDemo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web/tree/main/ExtensionDemo) for developing audio and video extensions.


The following code sample shows how to develop an audio extension:

```typescript
class YourExtension extends AudioExtension<YourProcessor> {
    // Create a Processor
    protected _createProcessor(): YourProcessor {
        return new YourProcessor();
    }
}

class CustomAudioProcessor extends AudioProcessor {
    // Receive audio data from the previous AudioNode
    onNode(node: AudioNode, context: IAudioProcessorContext) {
        // Create an AudioNode
        const audioContext = context.getAudioContext();
        const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();

        // Connect to the previous AudioNode
        node.connect(gainNode);
    }

    process() {
        // TODO: Add the audio processing logic for your extension

        // Output the processed audio
        this.output(gainNode, context);
    }
}
```

This section describes the auxiliary APIs for developing an audio extension.

### AudioProcessor

#### name

```
name: string;
```

The name of the` Processor`.

#### enabled

```
enabled :boolean;
```

Whether the` Processor` is enabled.

#### ID

```
public readonly ID:string;
```

The identifier of the` Processor`.

#### kind

```
public get Kind():'video' | 'audio';
```

The type of the ` Processor`, which is categorized as video or audio.

#### context

```
protected context?: IProcessorContext;
```

This property allows the `Processor` to request and recapture the original media stream.

#### onPiped

```
abstract onPiped?(context: IProcessorContext): void;
```

Reports that a `LocalVideoTrack` connects to the current media processing pipeline.

**Note**: This callback is not triggered if only `Processor`s are connected``. For example: The app client calls `processorA.pipe(processorB)`.

#### onUnpiped

```
abstract onUnPiped?(): void;
```

Reports that the `Processor` disconnects from the media processing pipeline.

#### onEnableChange

```
abstract onEnableChange?(enabled: boolean): void | Promise<void>;
```

Reports that the `Processor` is enabled or disabled.

#### inputNode

```typescript
protected inputNode?:AudioNode;
```

Audio received by the `Processor`.

#### outputNode

```typescript
protected outputNode?:AudioNode;
```

Audio output by the `Processor`.

### AudioProcessorContext

```typescript
interface IAudioProcessorContext extends IProcessorContext {
    getAudioContext(): Promise<AudioContext>;
}
```

This class allows the `AudioProcessor `to request and recapture the original audio stream.

### Ticker

#### constructor

```typescript
public constructor(type:"Timer" | "RAF" | "Oscillator", interval: number):Ticker;
```

The constructor of the ` Ticker` class.

**Parameters**

- `type`: The following types are supported:
   - `Timer`: Using `setTimeout` as the internal ` timer` of the extension.
   - (Recommended) `RAF`: Using `requestAnimationFrame` as the internal timer of the extension. In most cases, this type of `Ticker` has the best rendering performance.
   - `Oscillator`: Using `Web Audio's ``OscillatorNode` as the internal timer of the extension. This type of `Ticker` keeps running when the browser page is not being viewed.
- `interval`: The `interval `between two recurring callbacks.  The `Ticker` tries its best to execute at this interval, but might not be 100% accurate.

#### Ticker.add

```typescript
public add(fn: Function): void;
```

Adds a timer task.

#### Ticker.remove

```typescript
public remove():void;
```

Removes the added timer task.

#### Ticker.start

```typescript
public start():void;
```

Starts the timer.

#### Ticker.stop

```typescript
public stop():void;
```

Stops the timer.

### Logger

```
interface IExtensionLogger {
    debug(...args: any): void;
    error(...args: any): void;
    info(...args: any): void;
    warning(...args: any): void;
}
```

This class provides four levels of logs.

If the app client chooses to upload the logs when calling `AgoraRTC.registerExtension`, the status of the extension that implements the `Logger` class is updated.

### Reporter

#### Reporter.reportApiInvoke

```typescript
public reportApiInvoke<T>(params: ReportApiInvokeParams): AgoraApiExecutor<T>;
```

Reports events related to API calls to the SDK.

The definitions of `ReportApiInvokeParams` and `AgoraApiExecutor` are as follows:

```typescript
interface ReportApiInvokeParams {
    // The API name
    name: string;
    // Parameters or options related to the API
    options: any;
    // Whether to report the result of the API call
    reportResult?: boolean;
    // How long is counted as timeout for the API call
    timeout?: number;
}
interface AgoraApiExecutor<T> {
    // The API call succeeds
    onSuccess: (result: T) => void;
    // The API call fails
    onError: (err: Error) => void;
}
```
