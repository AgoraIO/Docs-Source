To streamline the use of token authentication and RESTful APIs within your infrastructure, Agoraâ€™s developer community offers the open-source [Agora Go Backend Middleware](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-go-backend-middleware). The backend provides RESTful APIs for tasks such as token generation, cloud recording management, and real-time transcription. This guide shows you how to implement a token server using the community middleware.
