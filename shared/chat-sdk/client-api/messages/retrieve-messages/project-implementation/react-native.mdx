### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `fetchConversationsFromServerWithCursor` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```typescript
// pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
// cursor: If `cursor` is an empty string, the SDK retrieves from the latest conversation.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchConversationsFromServerWithCursor(cursor, pageSize)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("get conversions success");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get conversions fail.", reason);
  });
```

If you do not support `fetchConversationsFromServerWithCursor`, call `fetchConversationsFromServerWithPage` to retrieve the conversations from the server. Altogether, the SDK can retrieve the last 100 conversations in the past seven days. To adjust the time limit or the number of conversations retrieved, contact support@agora.io.

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

You can call `fetchHistoryMessagesByOptions` based on the `ChatFetchMessageOptions` class to pull message history of a one-to-one or group chat from the server. To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull 20 messages at a time, with a maximum of 50. If the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the `pageSize` value, then only the `pageSize` number of messages will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the `pageSize` value.

Using the `ChatFetchMessageOptions` class, you can pull message history with the following conditions:

- message sender,
- message type,
- message time period,
- message search direction,
- whether to save the pulled messages to the database.

For group chats, you can set the `from` parameter to pull messages sent by individual members of the group.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note">
<ul><li>To use this API, upgrade to v1.3.0 or above.</li>
<li>By default, you can retrieve message history of one-to-one and group chats. To obtain message history of a chat room, contact support@agora.io.</li>
<li>The storage time of message history and offline messages on the server is defined by your pricing package. See [Pricing plan details](../../reference/pricing-plan-details).</li>
<li>For event notifications, if the receiving user is offline, the storage time of the event notification is consistent with the storage time of the offline message, which also depends on your pricing package.</li></ul>
</Admonition>

Refer to the following code sample:

```typescript
// convId Conversation ID: The other party's user ID for a one-to-one chat, group ID for a chat group, and chat room ID for a chat room.
// convType Conversation type: PeerChat, GroupChat, or RoomChat.
// The starting message ID of the cursor query. If this parameter is set to an empty string, start from the latest message.
// pageSize The number of messages expected to be pulled per page. The value range is [1,50], and the default value is 10.
// option
// option.from Message sender
// option.msgTypes Filters the types of the pulled messages
// option.startTs Filter the message start time
// option.endTs Filters the message end time
// option.direction Message search direction
// option.needSave Whether to save the message
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.fetchHistoryMessagesByOptions(convId, convType, {
     cursor: cursor,
     pageSize: pageSize,
     options: options as ChatFetchMessageOptions,
   })
   .then((res) => {
     console.log("fetchHistoryMessagesByOptions is success.", res);
   })
   .catch();
```

You can also call `fetchHistoryMessages` to pull messages of a specified conversation from the server.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull a maximum of 50 messages at a time and do multiple iterations, if necessary. After pulling, the SDK will automatically update the message to the local database.

```typescript
// Conversation ID.
const convId = "convId";
// Conversation type. See the `ChatConversationType` enumeration type for details.
const convType = ChatConversationType.PeerChat;
// The maximum number of pulled messages.
const pageSize = 10;
// Start message ID for search.
const startMsgId = "";
// Message search direction.
const direction = ChatSearchDirection.UP;
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.fetchHistoryMessages(convId, chatType, {
     pageSize,
     startMsgId,
     direction,
   })
   .then((messages) => {
     console.log("get message success: ", messages);
   })
   .catch((reason) => {
     console.log("load conversions fail.", reason);
   });
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```typescript
// isPinned: Sets whether to pin a conversation.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.pinConversation(convId, isPinned)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("pin conversions success");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("pin conversions fail.", reason);
  });
```


### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```typescript
// pageSize: The number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50]。
// cursor：The cursor position to start getting data.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor(cursor, pageSize)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("get conversions success");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get conversions fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Pin a message

You can call `ChatManager#pinMessage` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `MessageListener#onMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `MessageListener#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `ChatMessagePinInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.pinMessage(
     messageId // message ID
   )
   .then(() => {
     // Operation completed
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed
   });
```

### Unpin a message

You can call `ChatManager#unpinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `MessageListener#onMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `MessageListener#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, `Message#pinnedInfo` is returned empty and the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.unpinMessage(
     messageId // message ID
   )
   .then(() => {
     // Operation completed
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed
   });
```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `ChatManager#fetchPinnedMessages` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.fetchPinnedMessages(
     convId, // Conversation ID
     convType // Conversation type
   )
   .then((res) => {
     // Operation is completed, the specified message list is obtained
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed
   });
```

### Get pinned details of a single message

You can call `ChatMessagePinInfo` to get the pinned details of a single message.

- If the message is pinned, this class returns the time of pinning and the user ID of the user who has pinned it.
- If the message is not pinned, this class is returned empty.

```typescript
// ...
const msg: ChatMessage;
const info = await msg.getPinInfo;
// todo: Get the pin information of the message
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimestamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerWithMsgIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```typescript
// Delete messages by message ID
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeMessagesFromServerWithMsgIds(convId, convType, msgIds)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("test:success:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.warn("test:error:", error);
  });
// Delete messages by timestamp
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeMessagesFromServerWithTimestamp(
    convId,
    convType,
    timestamp
  )
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("test:success:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.warn("test:error:", error);
  });
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeConversationFromServer` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```typescript
// convId: conversation ID
// convType: conversation type.
// isDeleteMessage: Whether to delete historical messages from the server with the conversation.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeConversationFromServer(convId, convType, isDeleteMessage)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("remove conversions success");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("remove conversions fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. Each conversation can have up to 20 tags. This feature applies only to private chats and chat groups.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `fetchConversationsByOptions` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `marks` property.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations per user), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.addRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark(
     convIds, // Session ID collection
     ChatConversationMarkType.Type0 // Mark type 0
   )
   .then(() => {
     // Operation successful
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed.
   });
```

### Remove conversation tag

You can call `deleteRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark` to remove tag of a conversation. Tags can be removed for up to 20 conversations at a time. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side tags.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.deleteRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark(
     convIds, // Conversation ID
     ChatConversationMarkType.Type0 // Mark type 0
  )
   .then(() => {
     // Operation successful
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed.
   });
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `fetchConversationsByOptions` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```typescript
// Create a search criteria object
const option = ChatConversationFetchOptions.withMark(
   ChatConversationMarkType.Type0
);
// Search the conversation list for tags that match the criteria.
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.fetchConversationsByOptions(option)
   .then((res) => {
     // The operation is completed and the conversation list that meets the conditions has been obtained.
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed.
   });
```

### Query local conversations by the conversation tag

For local conversations, you can call the `getAllConversations` method to obtain all local conversations and then perform conversation filtering yourself. The following is an example of querying all local conversations marked with `ChatConversationMarkType#Type0`:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
   .chatManager.getAllConversations()
   .then((res) => {
       for (const conv of res) {
         if (conv.marks && conv.marks.length > 0) {
           // Tagged conversation
         }
       }
     });
   .catch((error) => {
     // Operation failed.
```

### Get all tags of a local conversation

You can call `ChatConversation#marks` to get all the tags of a local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.getConversation(convId, convType)
  .then((res) => {
    // Get marks：res?.marks
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Operation failed
  });
```
