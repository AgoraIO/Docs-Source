## Understand the tech





## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 9.0 or later.
- An iOS device running iOS 8.0 or later.

## Project setup

Follow these steps to integrate the SDK into your project:

1. Download the [Video SDK v4.0.0 Beta](./downloads) and unzip.
2. Copy the header files in the `rtc/sdk/low_level_api/include` directory and save them under the directory of your project file.

## Implement a video filter extension
This section describes the APIs required for implementing a video filter extension.

### Implement a video filter





#### Sample code




### Encapsulate into an extension





#### Sample code




## Package the video filter extension



After encapsulating the filter into an extension, you need to register and package it into a `.framework` or `.xcframework` file, and submit it together with a file that contains the extension name, vendor name and filter name to Agora.




Register the extension with the macro `REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER`, which is in the `AgoraExtensionProviderEntry.h` file.

Use this macro at the entrance of the extension implementation. When the SDK loads the extension, this macro automatically registers it to the SDK. For example:

```objc
REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER(ByteDance, agora::extension::ExtensionProvider);
```

## Sample project



Agora provides an iOS sample project [SimpleFilter](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/tree/main/iOS/APIExample/SimpleFilter) for developing audio and video filter extensions.
