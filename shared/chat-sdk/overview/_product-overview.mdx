### One-to-one chat

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat provides online and offline messages in conversations. This entire message history can be downloaded. Users can acknowledge message receipt and recall and delete messages. They can also customize the name of the other participant in the conversation. 

### Multi-device login

One account logs your users in to <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat on multiple devices concurrently. All messages are synchronized between all devices.

### User management

Each user manages their own account, as follows:

- Profile: Add a personal avatar, nickname, mail address, birthday, signature, and custom properties.
- Contacts: Invite, add, and remove friends. Control a block list that prevents users in the list from adding you as a contact or sending you messages. 
- Group memberships: Accept and decline group invitations. Join and leave groups.

### Groups and chat rooms

Apart from [one-to-one-chat](#one-to-one-chat), the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> {props.SDK} provides group and chat room support as well. This includes the following features:

- Lifecycle: Create and delete groups, and update the group name, description and subject.
- Membership: set a group to be invitation only, or open to everyone. Add users to or remove them from a group, and stop unwanted users from joining the group.
- Roles: Each user in a group is either a member, an admin, or an owner. Permissions differ by role.   
- Announcements: Publishing announcements to the group or chat room.
- Block list: Block users in a group. 

When a member of the group is offline, new messages to the group are sent to the offline member using push notifications. 


### Message recall

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat enables users to recall a message from one-to-one, chat room, and group conversations.

### Push notifications

When your app is either running in the background or the process has terminated, or the user is offline, incoming messages are forwarded to a third-party push server. As soon as the user comes back online, all undelivered messages are pushed to mobile devices the app is installed on.

Push notifications for Android are implemented using [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging); iOS notifications are sent using the [Apple Push Notification service (APNs)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_apns).

### Message synchronization between multiple devices

All messages are stored in <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat servers. Messages sent and received from multiple devices that use the same account are completely synchronized.
