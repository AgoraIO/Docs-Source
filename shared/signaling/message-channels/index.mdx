<Vg k="SIG" /> provides message channels for implementing publish-subscribe, or pub/sub messaging in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. In a message channel, you subscribe to a channel to receive messages. However, you do not need to join the channel to publish messages. This page shows you how to use <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> pub/sub messaging to implement various communication model into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. 

## Understand the tech

Pub/sub is the simplest form of messaging. <Vg k="SIG" /> creates a channel when a user subscribes to it. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for events which contain messages users publish to a channel.

<Vg k="SIG" /> allows thousands of message channels to exist in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> at the same time. However, due to client-side performance and bandwidth limitations, a single client may only subscribe to a limited number of channels concurrently. For details, see [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations).

### Communication models in message channels

<Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> enables you to implement a variety of communication models using message channels. A communication model refers to the data flow relationship between the message sender and receiver within a channel. Using the pub/sub message distribution mechanism, you can seamlessly implement the following communication models:

**1-to-1 channel**: This model facilitates communication between two users. It is ideal for creating private chat channels, one-on-one customer service support, and personal interactions.

**Group channel**: A group channel facilitates many-to-many communication, making user groups within the channel visible to each other. This model is suitable for workgroups, family discussions, and community interactions. Access control options in <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> enable you to implement open or invitation-based participation.

**Broadcast channel**: A broadcast channel enables one-to-many communication, where a single sender broadcasts messages to multiple recipients. This model is useful for group announcements, surveys, and disseminating information to a large audience.

**Unicast channel**: This model allows many users to send messages to a single recipient. This model is beneficial for scenarios such as questionnaire feedback collection, IoT sensor data aggregation, and centralized data collection.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project, and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.
