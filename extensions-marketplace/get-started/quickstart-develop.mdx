Extensions are add-ons designed to extend the functionality of the <Vpd k="SDK" /> [Extensions Marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/) is home to extensions that make your app more fun. Extensions provide features such as Audio effects and voice changing, Face filters and background removal, and Live transcription and captioning.

In the Agora Extensions Marketplace:
- Vendors create and publish extensions to provide functionality such as audio and video processing.
- App developers use extensions to quickly implement fun and interactive functionality.

This page shows Vendors how extensions work and the steps you take to develop and publish your extension to Extensions Marketplace.

## Understand the tech

An extension accesses voice and video data when it is captured from the user's local device, modifies it, then plays the updated data to local and remote video channels.

A typical transmission pipeline consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, pre-processing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and play. Audio or video filter extensions are inserted into either the pre-processing or post-processing procedure, in order to modify the voice or video data in the transmission pipeline.

You can currently implement the following extension types:

- **Audio**: for voice effects and noise cancellation. Audio filters work as follows:

- **Video**: features such as face filters and background removal. Video filters work as follows:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequisites />

## Project Setup

To become a vendor, fill in the [vendor application form (This doc is not migrated yet)](https://www.agora.io/en/extensions-marketplace/vendor-application/) and click **APPLY NOW** to submit it.

Agora reviews your application in 7 working days and sends you the result through an email.


## Step 2: Develop your extension

Once your application to become a partner is approved, you can start developing your extension. Agora provides the following documentation for your reference:

- To develop an audio or video extension for iOS, Android, macOS, or Windows, refer to:
  - [Understand extensions](./plugin?platform=Android)
  - [Audio filter extensions](./audio_filter_android)
  - [Video filter extensions](./video_filter_android)
- To develop an audio or video extension for Web, refer to:
  - [Understand extensions](./plugin_web_ng)
  - [Audio extensions](./audio_processor_web_ng)
  - [Video extensions](./video_processor_web_ng)
- To share provisioning, usage, and billing information with Agora, refer to:
  - [Provisioning API](./provisioning)
  - [Usage and billing API](./usage)
- To improve user experience of your extension through clear documentation, refer to:
	- [Implementation guides](./implementation-guide)

## Step 3: Test your extension

When your extension is almost developed, you need to test the functionality and performance of your extension. You also need to validate the user interface of your extension in a test environment.

To test your extension, submit an application for testing. For details, see [Test Your Extension](./test_extension).

Agora processes your application in 7 working days and informs you through an email when it's done.

## Step 4: Publish your extension

When your extension is thoroughly developed and tested, you need to submit it for Agora review and provide the finalized version of your extension listing assets. For details, see [Publish Your Extension](./publish-extension).

Agora reviews your extension in 7 working days. If your extension passes the review, Agora updates the listing of your extension and informs you through an email. If your extension fails the review, Agora sends an email to report the issues you need to address.

Once you are ready to go, Agora publishes your extension in the [Extensions Marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/) and everyone can see it.
