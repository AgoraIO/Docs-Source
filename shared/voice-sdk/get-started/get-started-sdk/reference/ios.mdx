### Complete source code

For a more complete example, see the [open source <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> example project](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/tree/master/iOS) on GitHub.

### Install <Vpd k="SDK" /> using CocoaPods

1.	Ensure that you have installed *CocoaPods* before performing the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2.	In terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3.	Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project and replace `version` with the version of the SDK that you want to integrate.

	```bash
	# platform :ios, '9.0'
	target 'Your App' do
		pod 'AgoraAudio_iOS', 'version'
	end
	```

4.	Return to terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install <Vpd k="SDK" />. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5.	Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.
