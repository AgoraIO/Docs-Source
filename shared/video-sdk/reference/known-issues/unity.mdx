The list of known issues page is continuously updated as the systems evolve. Agora suggests you regularly upgrade to the latest version of the SDK, which includes new features, bug fixes and improvements.

- Unity SDK v4.4.0

    **MacOS 15 Sequoia beta system issue**

    When the app path (including the App name) contains non-English characters (such as Chinese characters), the compiled `Metal shader library` may not contain any methods, causing the app to crash. See [this article](../../help/other-issues/macos_15_beta) for the workaround.

- Unity SDK v4.2.6

    **AirPods Pro Bluetooth connection issue (iOS)**

    AirPods Pro does not support A2DP protocol in communication audio mode, which may lead to connection failure in that mode.

- Unity SDK v4.2.3

    **Android 14 screen sharing issue**

    Due to changes in the screen sharing behavior of Android 14 system, using devices with this version for screen sharing may entail the following issues:

    - Switching between the landscape and portrait mode during screen sharing can interrupt the current screen sharing process and a window will pop up asking if you want to start recording the screen. Once confirmed, screen sharing can be started.

    - When integrating the SDK, setting the Android `targetSdkVersion` to 34 may cause the screen sharing feature to be unavailable or even cause the application to crash.
