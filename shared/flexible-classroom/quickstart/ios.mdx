## Project setup

To set up your <Vg k="FC" /> project, download the source code.

The source code for Flexible Classroom is located in the Github [Flexible-classroom-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-ios.git) and [apaas-extapp-ios](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/apaas-extapp-ios) repositories. To download the source code, take the following steps:

1. Clone the `Flexible-classroom-iOS` repository locally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-ios.git
   ```

1. After the download is complete, navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd flexible-classroom-ios
   ```

1. Agora recommends switching the branch to the latest release. To switch the branch version, run the following command. Remember to replace `{VERSION}` with a specific version number:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/{VERSION}
   ```

   For example, if you want to switch to the branch for version `2.8.0`, run the command:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/2.8.0
   ```

   The following image shows how to see the latest release branch in the GitHub repository:
