    1.  Take the following steps to setup a new Electron project:

        1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.

        2.  Execute the following command in the terminal:

            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
            ```
            This command clones the Electron quick-start project that you use to implement <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />.

    2.  Install the <Vpd k="SDK" />

        Open a terminal window in your project folder and execute the following command to download and install the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

        ```bash
        npm i agora-electron-sdk
        ```
        Make sure the path to your project folder does not contain any spaces. This might cause error during the <Vpd k="SDK" /> installation.
