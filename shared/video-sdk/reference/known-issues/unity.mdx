### Unity SDK v4.2.3

**Android 14 screen sharing issue**

Due to changes in the screen sharing behavior of Android 14 system, using devices with this version for screen sharing may entail the following issues:

- Switching between the landscape and portrait mode during screen sharing can interrupt the current screen sharing process and a window will pop up asking if you want to start recording the screen. Once confirmed, screen sharing can be started.

- When integrating the SDK, setting the Android `targetSdkVersion` to 34 may cause the screen sharing feature to be unavailable or even cause the application to crash.
