Client configuration enables you to customize the behavior of your <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance according to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>'s requirements. 

## Understand the tech

When initializing a <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance, configure any or all of the following features:

- **Geographical area access**  
    When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of Agora SD-RTN™. However, to comply with local laws and regulations, you may want to specify or restrict connections to a specific geographical area. Agora enables you to control and customize data routing in your app by specifying the Agora SD-RTN™ region users connect to.

- **Enable proxy connection**  
    You use a proxy connection to ensure reliable connectivity for your users when they connect from an environment with a restricted network. This helps in maintaining a stable connection even in environments with network restrictions.
</PlatformWrapper>

- **Private deployment**  
    Private deployment enables you to deploy and manage the <Vg k="SIG" /> environment on your own infrastructure rather than using Agora services. This feature is fully supported since version 2.2.0.
</PlatformWrapper>

- **Logging**  
    Logging enables you to output detailed information from the SDK for locating and fixing problems during the development and testing phases. By configuring logging settings, you can control the amount and type of information logged by the SDK.

- **Data encryption**  
    Enabling encryption ensures that only authorized users are able to read messages sent through <Vg k="SIG" />. Signaling provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission. For implementation details, see [Data encryption](../core-functionality/data-encryption).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.

## Configure the client instance

This section explains how to set up and customize various features when you initialize a <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance.
