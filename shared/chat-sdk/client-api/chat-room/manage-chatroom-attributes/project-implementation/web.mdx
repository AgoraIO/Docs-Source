### Modify the chat room attributes

All chat room members can retrieve the detailed information of the current chat room, including the subject, announcements, description, member type, and admin list.

The chat room owner and admins can also set and update the chat room information.

```javascript
// Chat room members can call getChatRoomDetails to get the information of the specified chat room.
AgoraError *error = nil;
let option = {
    chatRoomId: 'chatRoomId'
}
conn.getChatRoomDetails(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat room owner and admins can call modifyChatRoom to update the chat room attributes.
let option = {
    chatRoomId: 'chatRoomId',
    chatRoomName: 'chatRoomName', // The name of the chat room
    description: 'description',   // The description of the chat room
    maxusers: 200                 // The maximum number of chat room members
}
conn.modifyChatRoom(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```

### Manage chat room announcements

All chat room members can retrieve the chat room announcements.

The chat room owner and admins can set and update the chat room announcements. Once the announcements are updated, all the chat room members receive the `updateAnnouncement` callback.

```javascript
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomAnnouncement to retrieve the chat room announcements.
var option = {
    roomId: 'roomId'                        
};
conn.fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat room owner and admins can call updateChatRoomAnnouncement to set or update the chat room announcements.
let option = {
    roomId: 'roomId',  
    announcement: 'hello everyone'                  
};
conn.updateChatRoomAnnouncement(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```
