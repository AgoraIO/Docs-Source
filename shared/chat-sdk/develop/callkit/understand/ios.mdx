1. Initialize `AgoraChatCallKit` by calling `init`.
2. Call `startSingleCallWithUid` or `startInviteUsers` on the caller's client to send a call invitation for one-to-one or group calls.
3. On the callee's client, accept or decline the call invitation after receiving `callDidReceive`. Once a user accepts the invitation, they enter the call.
4. When the call ends, the SDK triggers the `callDidEnd` callback.
