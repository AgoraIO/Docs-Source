Netless Whiteboard is acquired by Agora and now fully integrated into the Agora product suite. This guide shows how to migrate all the projects under your Netless account to Agora Console. 

## Prerequisites

To follow the procedure in this document, you must have an existing Netless account.


- Before the migration completes, do not enable the whiteboard feature in Agora Console; otherwise, the migration may fail.
- If you do not have a Netless account, you can skip the migration procedure and directly enable the whitebaord feature. See [Enable and Configure Interactive Whiteboard](../develop/enable-whiteboard).

## Migration procedure

To migrate the projects under your current Netless account to Agora Console, follow the steps for the account case that matches your situation.

### A Netless account only

  1. Login to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io ) using the email address linked with your Netless account.

  1. Click **Send Email**. 

  1. Follow the instructions in the email you receive to reset your password. 

The reset process automatically creates a new Agora account using the email address linked with your Netless account. Then you can use the following steps to migrate your projects:

  1. Login to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io ) again using your new password.

  1. Follow the on-screen instructions, then click **Migrate**. 

 Agora automatically migrates all your projects from Netless to Agora Console.

### A Netless account and an Agora account that use the same email address

  1. Login to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io) using the email address linked with both accounts.

  1. Follow the on-screen instructions, then click **Migrate**. 

Agora automatically migrates all your projects from Netless to Agora Console.


### A Netless account and an Agora account that use different email addresses

To migrate to the existing Agora account, contact sales at sales@agora.io.

To create a new Agora account and migrate Netless projects to that account, follow the steps in <a href="#netlessaccount">A Netless account only</a>.
