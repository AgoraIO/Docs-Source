In <Vg k="SIG" />, the built-in functionality enables you to send only string and binary messages. Although the SDK does not provide a built-in parsable and extensible message data structure, you can build your own structured message payload according to your business needs.

Some commonly used message types in <Vg k="SIG" /> scenarios are:

- **Plain text message**: Contains text only.
- **Text message**: Contains text and attachment URLs for images or files.
- **Video file message**: Contains text description, video address, thumbnail address, and other related information.
- **Questionnaire and answer messages**: Contains a question and preset answer options.
- **Invitation message**: Invitation to join a private or group chat.
- **Signaling message**: Invitation containing instructions to initiate a video or audio chat.
- **Command message**: A control command message to a device in parallel driving, or a device status message uploaded by a sensor or an IoT application.
- **State synchronization messages**: Position, viewpoint, or current status messages of a player in a game or metaverse.

## Understand the tech

The message payload structure should be readable and extensible to reduce the cost of building and maintaining the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. A well-designed payload structure also facilitates compatibility between old and new versions during upgrades. 

Consider an example where you send and receive the following types of message payloads through your <Vg k="SIG" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

- `"This is a message!"`
- `{message: "https://cdn.agora.io/assets/avatar.png"}`
- `{message: { x = 10, y = 100, z = 55 } }`

If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> receives a large number of such messages, it becomes difficult to determine if a particular message contains just text, a URL, or location information. If you scan all messages and check for substrings like `https` or `x = `, this approach becomes inefficient as the number of app users, message types, and the number of messages increase. To solve this problem, introduce predefined fields into your message payload structure to increase parsability and scalability. For example, add a `type` and other relevant fields to each message structure as follows:

| Original message | Structured message |
|:---|:---------------|
| `"Hello, this is a message!"` | `{type: "text", message: "Hello, this is a message!"}` |
| `{message: "https://cdn.agora.io/assets/avatar.png"}` | `{type: "image", url: "https://cdn.agora.io/assets/avatar.png"}` |
| `{message: { x = 10, y = 100, z = 55 }}` | `{type: "position", coordinates: { x: 10, y: 100, z: 55 }}` |
