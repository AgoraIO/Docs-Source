Agora Chat supports logging in to the same account from up to 4 devices at the same time by default. You can increase the number of
devices per platform up to 10 by going to **Agora Console > Project management > Relevant project > Agora Chat configuration > Features > Multi Device**.

In cases of multiple device login, all logged-in devices synchronize the following information and operations:

- Messages, including online messages, offline messages, push notifications (if the third-party push service is enabled, the offline device receives it), the corresponding receipts and read status, and so on;
- Friends and group-related operations;
- Message-thread-related operations;
- Conversation-related operations.

The following table summarizes the strategy of forcing other devices to log out and the automatic login security check in the single-device and multi-device login use-cases:

## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed='web'>
During initialization, the SDK generates a login ID to identify the device when multiple devices log in and push messages, and sends this ID to the server. The server automatically sends new messages to the user's logged-in device, monitors operations on other devices, and synchronizes multiple devices. The SDK provides the following multi-device use-case functions:

- Get the login ID list of the other logged-in devices of the current user;

- Get the list of online logged-in devices of the specified account;

- Force the specified account to log out from a single device;

- Force the specified account to log out from all devices;

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed={['react-native','ios','unity','windows']}>
- Get friend or group operations on other devices.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform={['ios','unity','windows']}>
- Get operations on other devices.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform='react-native'>
- Set the name of the login device;

- Set the platform of the login device;

- Get notified about multi-device synchronization.
</PlatformWrapper>
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform='web'>

Chat SDK generates a new unique login ID every time a user logs in and sends the ID to the server. The server automatically sends new messages to the device where the user logs in, and can automatically monitor friend or group operations on other devices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, initialize and connect the SDK to the server. See [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) for details.
