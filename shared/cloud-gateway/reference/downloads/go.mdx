   ```

1. Run the following commands in sequence to compile the project:

    # Execute compilation
    make build
    ```

 1. In the project's `go.mod./builds` file, add the following lines to add the required dependencies for the SDK:

    ```bash
    # Change /path/to/go_rtc_sdk to the actual path of the SDK you downloaded in step 1
    replace github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 => /path/to/go_rtc_sdk
    # Change version_number to the actual version number of the SDK. You can get the version number in the release notes, such as v2.2.4
    require github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 version_number
    ```
