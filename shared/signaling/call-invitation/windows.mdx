## Send a call invitation

The steps to send a call invitation are as follows:

1.  The caller creates the `LocalInvitation` by calling `createLocalInvitation`; at the same time, the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` begins.

2.  The caller sends a call invitation by calling `sendLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` begins as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationReceived` callback, and then the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationReceivedByPeer` callback.

The sample code for sending a call invitation is as follows:
    ```cpp
    // The sample code is based on Qt.

    // Get call manager.
    bool CAgoraRtmInstance::InitCallManager()
    {
        if(!m_callService)
            return false;
        m_callManager =m_callService->getRtmCallManager(m_callEventHandler.get());
        return m_callManager != nullptr;
    }

    bool CAgoraRtmInstance::CallRemoteUser(QString remoteUserId)
    {
        if(!m_callManager)
            return false;
        m_remoteUserId   = remoteUserId;
            // Create the LocalInvitation.
        m_callInvitation = m_callManager->createLocalCallInvitation(remoteUserId.toUtf8());
        if(m_callInvitation){
                // Send a call invitation.
            int ret = m_callManager->sendLocalInvitation(m_callInvitation);
            return ret == 0 ? true : false;
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```
## Cancel a call invitation

The caller cancels the call invitation by calling `cancelLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationCanceled` callback. And then the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationCanceled` callback.

The sample code for canceling a call invitation is as follows:
    ```cpp
    // The sample code is based on Qt.


    // Cancel a call invitation.
    bool CAgoraRtmInstance::CancelLocalInvitation()
    {
        if(!m_callManager || !m_callInvitation)
            return false;
        int ret = m_callManager->cancelLocalInvitation(m_callInvitation);
        return ret == 0 ? true : false;
    }
    ```
## Accept a call invitation

The callee gets RemoteInvitation from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and accepts the call invitation by calling `acceptRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationAccepted` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationAccepted` callback.

![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1598604394009)

The sample code for accepting a call invitation is as follows:
    ```cpp
    // The sample code is based on QT

    // Accept call invitation
    bool CAgoraRtmInstance::AcceptRemoteInvitation(IRemoteCallInvitation* invitation)
    {
        int ret = m_callManager->acceptRemoteInvitation(invitation);
        return ret == 0 ? true : false;
    }
    ```

## Refuse a call invitation

The callee gets RemoteInvitation from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and refuses the call invitation by calling `refuseRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationRefused` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationRefused` callback.

![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1598604400671)

The sample code for refusing a call invitation is as follows:
    ```cpp
    // The sample code is based on QT

    // Decline call invitation
    bool RefuseRemoteInvitation(IRemoteCallInvitation* invitation)
    {
        int ret = m_callManager->refuseRemoteInvitation(invitation);
        return ret == 0 ? true : false;
    }
    ```
