### Create a project

To create a new ReactJS project with the necessary dependencies:

1. Ensure that you have installed [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) and `npm`.

1. Open a terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest agora-sdk-quickstart — — template react-ts
    ```

    This creates a folder named `agora-sdk-quickstart`.

### Integrate the SDK

Use one of the following methods to integrate the project dependencies:

* **npm**

    To install the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK using `npm`, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i agora-rtc-react agora-rtc-sdk-ng
    ```
  
* **CDN**

    To integrate React JS dependencies and the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK using CDN, add the following code to your HTML file:

    ```html
    <!-- Include the React development libraries (must be introduced in this order) -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <!-- If the above React libraries have already been integrated through npm, skip them and include only the Agora RTC React SDK -->
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/agora-rtc-react.2.1.0.js"></script>
    ```
