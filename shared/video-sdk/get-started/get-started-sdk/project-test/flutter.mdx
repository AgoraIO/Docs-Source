<PlatformWrapper platform = "flutter">
Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Connect a target device to your development computer.

1. Open Terminal and execute the following command in the project folder to run the sample project:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

1. Launch the App, grant microphone and camera permissions. If you set the user role to host, you see yourself in the local view.

1. On a second target device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Test the following scenarios:

    * If both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one device joins as the host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video frame. The audience can see the host in the remote video frame and hear the host's voice.

    On an Android device, the app UI appears similar to the following:
