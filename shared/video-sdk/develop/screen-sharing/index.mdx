During <Vpd k="NAME"/> broadcasts or video calls, hosts or video call users can use the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> feature in the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="VSDK" /> to share their screen content with other users or viewers in the form of video.

## Understand the tech

This section explains how you can integrate <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Screen sharing can be used in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|:---|:---------------|
| Online education | Teachers share their screens, teaching materials, drawing software or programming software with students for classroom demonstrations. |
| Game live broadcast | Hosts share their game footage with the audience. |
| Interactive live broadcast | Anchors share their screens and interact with the audience. |
| Videoconference | Meeting members share the screen to view PPT or documents. |
| Remote control | The controlled terminal displays its desktop to the master terminal. |

### Functionality

The <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> feature of the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the following functions suitable for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in various scenarios:

    ![Screen Sharing Functionality](/images/screen-sharing/tmp_screen-sharing-functionality.jpg)

- **Share the whole screen**: Share your entire screen, including all the information on the screen. This feature supports collecting and sharing information from two screens at the same time.
- **Share app window**: If you don't want to share the entire screen's content with other users, you can share only the screen within an app window.
- **Share designated areas**: If you only want to share a portion of the screen or app window, you can set a sharing area when turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> so that only the screen in that area will be shared.

#### Advanced features

In addition to the above functions, you can also get the following advanced sharing functions by adjusting the parameters when turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

    - **Shield a specified app window**: When sharing the screen, if you don't want to expose a specific app window, you can choose to shield it so that the window will not appear in the shared screen.
    - **Stroke**: If you need to outline the area being shared, you can stroke a specified app window or screen and customize the width, color, and transparency of the stroke.
    - **Pin an app window to the front**: If you share multiple app windows at the same time, the windows may block each other. You can specify an app window and bring it to the front to prevent it from being blocked by other windows.
    - **Set the sharing scenario**: The SDK automatically adjusts the QOE (Quality of Experience) policy according to the scenario you set:
        - When sharing documents, slides, tables, or remote control, you can set the sharing scene to **document** scene or **remote control** scene. Then, the SDK will give priority to ensuring image quality and reducing the delay of the receiving end watching the shared video.
        - When sharing games, movies, or live video broadcasts, you can set the shared scene to a **game** scene or **video** scene, and the SDK will prioritize ensuring smoothness.

    The availability of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> functions on each platform are as follows:

        - **Desktop (Windows and macOS)**: Supports all <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> features listed above.
        - **Mobile (Android and iOS)**: Only supports sharing the entire screen.

### Advantages

The <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> feature provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> has the following advantages:

    - **Ultra HD quality experience**: Supports Ultra HD video (4K resolution, 60 fps frame rate), giving users a smoother, high-definition, ultimate picture experience.
    - **Multi-app Support**: Compatible with many mainstream apps such as WPS Office, Microsoft Office Power Point, Visual Studio Code, Adobe Photoshop, Windows Media Player and Scratch. This makes it convenient for users to directly share specific apps during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> improving the function's ease of use.
    - **Multi-device support**: Supports multiple devices sharing at the same time and is compatible with Windows 8 systems, devices without independent graphics cards, dual graphics card devices, external screen devices, etc., to meet the needs of device usage in various scenarios.
    - **Multi-platform adaptation**: Supports iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Web, Unity, Flutter, React Native, Unreal Engine and other platforms.
    - **High security**: Supports sharing only the app or part of the screen, and supports blocking specified app windows, effectively ensuring user information security.

### Technical principles

Since Apple doesn't support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you need to create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream, use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the main process to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

    ![Screen Sharing iOS Tech](/images/screen-sharing/tmp_screen-sharing-ios-tech.jpg)

Depending on the actual business scenario, you can choose any of the following methods to call the API to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

    - Call `startScreenCapture` before joining the channel, then call `joinChannelByToken [2/4]` to join the channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
    - Call `startScreenCapture` after joining the channel, then call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to update the channel media options and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

#### Additional notes

In addition to the technical principles above, be aware of the following limitations:

    - After turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the resolution of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as the billing standard. Please see the billing instructions for details. The default resolution is **1280 Ã— 720**, but you can adjust it according to your business needs.
    - Due to system limitations, <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> only supports iOS 12.0 and above.
    - This feature requires a high level of device performance. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that you use an iPhone X or above.
    - After the user turns on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on an iOS device, the audio routing will automatically switch to the earpiece due to system limitations.
        - If you are currently using **call volume**, you can manually switch the audio routing, for example, you can switch the audio routing to speaker as desired.
        - If you are currently using **media volume**, you cannot manually switch audio routing in this scenario due to system limitations.
