A subscription package is a prepaid billing method. You can purchase a package in the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io) to cover usage for the current month.

This page explains how to purchase, and manage subscription and top-up packages.

### Purchase and upgrade

By default, each project is assigned the **Starter Package** upon creation. You can upgrade at any time to the **Basic**, **Standard**, **Premium**, or **Enterprise** package. Higher-tier packages provide greater discounts and lower unit prices. For details, see [Pricing](pricing).

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- All packages, except the Enterprise package can be purchased directly from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To upgrade to the Enterprise package, contact [Agora sales](mailto:sales@agora.io).
- You can upgrade sequentially or skip levels. For example, you may upgrade from Starter to Premium directly.
- Package upgrades take effect immediately on the day of the upgrade. If multiple upgrades are made on the same day, the last upgrade is applied.

#### Upgrade rules

* **Price amortization**: If you upgrade in the middle of a month, the upgrade cost is calculated based on the remaining days in the month.

  *Example*: Upgrading from Standard to Premium on August 15:
  *Upgrade Fee = (Premium Price − Standard Price) / 31 × 17*

* **Quota amortization**: The monthly quota is prorated based on the days before and after the upgrade.
  *Example*: Upgrading from Standard to Premium on August 16, with 100,000 minutes used:
  *Quota = (150,000 × 15/31) + (400,000 × 16/31) = 279,032 minutes*

### Renewal

To avoid service disruption, Agora recommends enabling auto-renewal. When enabled, your package renews automatically on the 25th of each month. Make sure your account has sufficient balance to avoid renewal failure.

If renewal fails:

* The system sends a notification and retries the renewal.
* If renewal fails by the end of the month, your package is downgraded to Starter.
* To restore the previous package, refer to [Purchase and Upgrade](#purchase-and-upgrade).

If auto-renewal is disabled, the package automatically downgrades to Starter after the current subscription package expires.

### Downgrade

You can downgrade by selecting and purchasing a lower-tier package. Downgrades take effect on the next renewal date, depending on when the request is made.

#### Examples:

* **Requested on August 15**: Downgrade takes effect on **August 25**, changing September’s plan.
* **Requested on August 26**: Downgrade takes effect on **September 25**, changing October’s plan.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- You can cancel a downgrade request before it takes effect.
- While a downgrade request is pending, you cannot make further upgrade/downgrade changes.
</Admonition>

### Cancel subscription

Direct cancellation of a subscription package is not supported. To cancel, [downgrade](#downgrade) to the Starter package.

## Top-up package

A top-up package is a pay-as-you-go plan. You can purchase a top-up package from the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io/v2) to cover usage that exceeds your monthly package quota.

### Purchase

You can purchase multiple top-up packages. They are deducted in the order of purchase.

#### Example:

* Purchased 250,000-minute top-up packages on **August 15** and **August 16**. On **September 1**, the first package is used before the second.

### Validity

Each top-up package is valid for one year, starting from the purchase date to the end of the same month of the following year.

#### Example:

* Purchased on **August 15, 2025** → valid until **August 31, 2026**

Unused minutes expire after the validity period and cannot be carried forward.

### Cancel top-up package

Cancelling a top-up package is not supported.
