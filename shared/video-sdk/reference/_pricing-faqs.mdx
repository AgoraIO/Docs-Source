This article describes common billing-related issues and their solutions.

## Free minutes

<details>
<summary>If I purchase a paid package, will I still get 10,000 free minutes each month?</summary>

**Answer**: No.

When you purchase a paid package, the free minutes are included in the package itself. Higher-tier packages offer more free minutes. The default 10,000 free minutes per month no longer apply.

For details, see [Pricing](pricing-strategy) listed in the package.
</details>

## Billing
<details>
<summary>If a user doesn’t publish or subscribe to any audio or video streams in a channel, will they be charged?</summary>

**Answer**:
Yes. Audio subscription fees will apply.

There is no charge for publishing audio or video streams. However, even if a user does not actively subscribe to any streams, audio usage time is still generated in the channel, which results in audio subscription fees.
</details>

## Duration and usage
<details>
<summary>How is usage duration calculated in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**:

Agora tracks usage in seconds and then converts it to minutes for billing. At the end of each month, it calculates the total audio and video usage in seconds, divides each by 60, and rounds up to the nearest whole minute.

For example:

* If you use 59 seconds of audio, it is billed as **1 minute**.
* If you use 61 seconds of video, it is billed as **2 minutes**.

The rounding error per month is within **1 minute**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I view individual user usage in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**: No.

The bill only shows the total audio and video usage for all users across all projects under your Agora developer account.

To check usage for an individual user, use the statistics reported by the SDK:

* **Android:** `onRtcStats` callback → `totalDuration` property
* **iOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **Windows:** `onRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **macOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property

<Admonition type="Note" info="info">
If the client disconnects due to a weak network, the call duration reported by the Agora RTC SDK might be inaccurate.
To improve accuracy, implement a heartbeat mechanism using the Agora RTM SDK or another signaling system. Subtract the disconnection time from the RTC-reported duration to get a more precise call duration for the user.

## Video resolution

<details>
<summary>Why is my billing rate set to ultra-high-definition when all users subscribe to 360 × 640 video streams?</summary>

**Answer**:

Billing is based on the aggregate resolution, which is the total resolution of all subscribed video streams combined.

Even if each individual stream is **360 × 640**, subscribing to multiple streams can cause the aggregate resolution to exceed **1,280 × 720**, which qualifies as ultra-high-definition (UHD) under Agora’s billing rules.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How is video stream resolution calculated in dual-stream mode?</summary>

**Answer**:

In dual-stream mode, a user's video resolution is calculated based on the type of stream received:

* If subscribed to the high-quality (large) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the resolution set by the sender.
* If subscribed to the low-quality (small) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the actual resolution received.
* If the high-quality stream is requested but the low-quality stream is delivered—for example, due to a weak network—the resolution is still calculated based on the actual resolution of the stream received.

<summary>How can I determine the resolution of a screen sharing video stream?</summary>

**Answer**:

The resolution of a screen sharing video stream is determined by the video resolution you set in the relevant API or class. If no resolution is specified, the default resolution is used for billing.

| **Platform** | **Class or Configuration**                 | **Default Resolution** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Android      | `ScreenCaptureParameters`                  | 1280 × 720             |
| iOS          | `AgoraScreenCaptureParameters2`            | 1280 × 720             |
| Windows      | `ScreenCaptureParameters`                  | 1920 × 1080            |
| macOS        | `AgoraScreenCaptureParameters`             | 1920 × 1080            |
| Web          | `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig.encoderConfig` | 1920 × 1080            |

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
On the Web, due to device and browser limitations, some browsers may not support the resolution you set. In such cases, billing is based on the actual captured resolution, not the configured value.

<details>
<summary>What is resolution calibration?</summary>

**Answer**:

Resolution calibration refers to adjusting the resolution of a video stream to a standard value when calculating aggregate resolution.

For example, a video stream with a resolution of **640 × 352** (225,280 pixels) is rounded up and treated as **640 × 360** (230,400 pixels) for billing purposes.

## Arrears

<details>
<summary>What should I do if my account is frozen due to an outstanding balance?</summary>

**Answer**:

If your account is frozen, you need to recharge it promptly. Once your balance meets or exceeds the minimum required amount, the account will be automatically unfrozen.

To avoid service interruptions, we recommend monitoring deduction emails, recharge reminders, and account freeze warnings sent by Agora.
