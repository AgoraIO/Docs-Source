Online proctoring refers to supervision of examinees through their web cameras, microphones, and by
sharing their screens during online exams. This can be useful in the following cases:

- College exams
- Professional/certification exams
- Recruitment

<Vg k="FC"/> provides <Vg k="FC_PROCTOR_SDK"/> to implement such supervision. Agora recommends a scenario where one examiner
proctors 25 to 50 examinees at the same time. This page illustrates how the proctoring feature works for an examiner
and an examinee using the [<Vg k="FC"/> web demo](./overview/downloads?platform=web).

## Prerequisites

- Examiner:
    - Appropriate test equipment:
        - Desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or a mobile device
        - Camera and microphone to broadcast to all examinees and transmit video
        - Speaker to monitor the sound of the examinees' environment
        - Chrome browser
    - Stable network connection: The device needs to monitor 6 students, 3 video streams per each at the same time. The recommended downlink bandwidth is 100M or more

- Examinee:
    - Appropriate test equipment:
        - Desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or a mobile device
        - Camera and microphone to monitor the examinee's surrounding environment

## How to use online proctoring

Examiners supervise examinees during an exam and can pay special attention to those who are suspected of cheating.
Examinees take the exam in a fully supervised environment that includes identity verification, streams from primary and secondary camera with sound, and
screen sharing.

### Examiner role

Take the following steps to join and proctor an exam:

1. Open the [<Vg k="FC"/> web demo](./overview/downloads?platform=web) and click **Create** to create a room.

   ![flexible_classroom_web_demo](/images/flexible-classroom/fc_web_demo.png)

2. Enter the classroom name, class start and end time, then select **Online Proctoring** in **Class mode** and click **Create**.

   ![create_classroom_web_demo](/images/flexible-classroom/create_classroom_web_demo.png)

    In the <Vg k="FC"/> demo, the room creator holds the examiner role by default. You have now successfully created a classroom under the proctoring scenario.

3. Test your hardware before entering the room to ensure that you can monitor the exam.

   ![online_proctoring](/images/flexible-classroom/online_proctoring.png)

4. Once hardware is successfully tested, click **Next step** to enter the room. After you enter the room, the exam starts
automatically at the preset time. You can also click **Start Exam** to start the exam manually.

5. During the exam you can see monitor screens, or surveillance walls, for examinees. You can do the following:
    - Switch the layout and filter surveillance walls.

    ![start_exam](/images/flexible-classroom/start_exam.png)

    - Broadcast video and audio to all examinees.

    ![broadcast_video_audio](/images/flexible-classroom/broadcast_video_audio.png)

    - Click the surveillance wall of an examinee to enter the monitoring details page.

    ![monitoring_details](/images/flexible-classroom/monitoring_details.png)

    On the monitoring details page, you can see the recording view and the monitoring view:

        - The recording view shows the examinee's video and screen recordings from the start of the exam to the current time. You can drag the time axis to jump to a specific time, or click a submitted abnormal event to jump to the time point of the event.

        - The monitoring view shows the real-time video and screen sharing of the examinee. If the examinee demonstrates abnormal exam behavior (cheating), you select the corresponding event and submit it. Preset abnormal events include multiple people on camera, cheat sheets, identity verification, and use of electronic devices. Abnormal events are customizable.

   If there are examinees that you suspect of cheating without solid evidence, you can pay closer attention to them. To do so,
   click the focus icon on the monitoring details page to add them to the corresponding list. You can then filter surveillance
   walls in the main proctoring page to show only those that require your special attention.

The test ends automatically when the test time is over, or you can manually click **End Test** to end the test in advance.
