The Internet of things (IoT) connects physical objects with sensors, processors, and software to enable data exchange with other devices. In related applications, such as apps for smart door bells and remote monitoring, IoT devices send or receive audio and video streams to perform their function. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK" /> gives you the ability to enable live voice and video streams on IoT devices on a variety of platforms and for many use cases, while also offering a compact SDK size, low memory usage, and low power consumption. Some typical application scenarios for <Vpd k="SDK" /> include:

* **Real-time monitoring**:  Integration into smart cameras and smart doorbells enables mobile device users to receive video feed from one or more cameras.

* **Two-way audio communication between mobile devices**: With <Vpd k="SDK" /> integrated into smart watches, users perform two-way audio communication between mobile devices.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate audio and video communication features into your IoT devices using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

The lightweight <Vpd k="SDK" /> is ideal for IoT applications due to its low power consumption. The SDK provides the following performance benefits:

* **Small SDK size**: The increase in app size is less than 400 KB after integration.
* **Low memory usage**: When the SDK is simultaneously sending and receiving 320x240 `H.264` video data, memory usage is less than 2 MB.
* **High connectivity**: Under normal conditions, connectivity is greater than 99%.
* **Data transfer speed**: A maximum of 50 Mbps for a user in a channel.
* **Network adaptability**:	Non-aware recovery from up to 50% packet loss.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

## Project setup

<ProjectSetup />

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To test your implementation, take the following steps:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
