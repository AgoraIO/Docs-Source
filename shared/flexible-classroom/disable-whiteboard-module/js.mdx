The Whiteboard interface is packaged in the file `packages/agora-classroom-sdk/src/infra/stores/common/base.ts`, and the whiteboard-related interface is in the file `packages/agora-classroom-sdk/src/infra/protocol/board.ts`.

```js
get boardApi() {
    return EduUIStoreBase._boardApi;
}
```

To enable or disable the Whiteboard, you monitor the status change of the Whiteboard caused by the teacher client and adjust the UI accordingly.

Call the Whiteboard-related interfaces `boardApi.enable()` and `boardApi.disable()` to turn the Whiteboard on or off.

```js
// Enable the Whiteboard
this.boardApi.enable();
...

// Disable the Whiteboard
this.boardApi.disable();
```
