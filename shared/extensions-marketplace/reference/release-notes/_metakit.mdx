### v2.1.0

v2.1.0 was released on March 6, 2024.

#### Improvements

This update optimizes the performance of the <Vg k="RTEE_MK"/> extension and adds support for two new `keys` in `setExtensionProperty`: [`requestTexture`](../develop/integrate/metakit#enable-texture-request) and [`switchTextureAvatarMode`](../develop/integrate/metakit#switch-texture-scene). These replace the original `addSceneView` and `switchAvatarMode` functions, respectively. The new interface supports automatic generation and return of texture data, which is then directly rendered, previewed, encoded, and transmitted through the SDK. This enhancement improves rendering performance, reduces latency, and ensures more efficient operation and a better user experience.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`requestTexture`](../develop/integrate/metakit#enable-texture-request)
- [`switchTextureAvatarMode`](../develop/integrate/metakit#switch-texture-scene)
