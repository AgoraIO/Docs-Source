Before running the Agora-live Android project, you need to set RTC and Media Pull(Cloud Player) parameters as below 

```Kotlin

# Project-wide Gradle settings.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
android.injected.testOnly=false
android.useAndroidX=true
# Automatically convert third-party libraries to use AndroidX
android.enableJetifier=true
# application build version code
APP_VERSION_CODE=1
# application version name
APP_VERSION_NAME=0.1.0
 
#----------- Server Host Config --------------
TOOLBOX_SERVER_HOST=https://toolbox-overseas-prod.sg3.agoralab.co
 
#----------- Config Agora Keys -----------
# RTM RTC SDK key Config
AGORA_APP_ID=
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=
 
 
# Cloud Player Config
CLOUD_PLAYER_KEY=
CLOUD_PLAYER_SECRET=


```

After creating an Agora project, you can obtain the values of these parameters from the Agora Console. Here are the details:


| Parameter | Description | How to Obtain |
| :-------  | :---------- | :------------ |
| AGORA_APP_ID | Agora project's App ID | Obtain App ID |
| AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE | Agora project's App Certificate  | Obtain App Certificate |
| CLOUD_PLAYER_KEY | Customer ID required for Agora's RESTful service to input online media streams | Obtain Customer ID and Secret |
| CLOUD_PLAYER_SECRET | Customer secret required for Agora's RESTful service to input online media streams | Obtain Customer ID and Secret |


To obtain these parameters:

1. AGORA_APP_ID: Log in to the Agora Console, navigate to your project, and find the App ID on the project overview page or in the project settings.

2. AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE: This is an optional parameter, but if you're using Agora's security features, you can generate an App Certificate from the Agora Console. This usually involves selecting a role and a timestamp expiration policy.

3. CLOUD_PLAYER_KEY and CLOUD_PLAYER_SECRET: These are credentials for authenticating your access to Agora's RESTful services, such as for retrieving media streams. You might need to create a customer account or an API key pair specifically for this purpose. The exact steps to obtain these depend on your Agora service plan and whether you have an existing account for this purpose. Typically, you'll find the customer ID and secret in the Agora Console's API credentials section or in the documentation related to the specific service you're using.

Make sure to keep these credentials secure and never share them publicly.
