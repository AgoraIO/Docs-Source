<PlatformWrapper platform="web">

To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, call `setArea` and pass in the region you want to exclude or include. In `main,js`, add the following code after `const agoraEngine = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });`:
```javascript
// Your app will only connect to Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
AgoraRTC.setArea({
  areaCode:"NORTH_AMERICA"
})
// You can use [] to include more than one region.
```
If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

* Whitelist certain domains
* Allow all IP addresses 
* Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to="{{global.AGORA_DOCS_URL}}/{{platform.NAME}}/cloud_proxy_web_ng?platform=Web">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>.
