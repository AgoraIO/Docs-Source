To improve data security, Agora supports encrypting media streams during real-time engagement. 

Agora <Vpd k="NAME" /> supports built-in encryption methods.

## Implementation

Before enabling media-stream encryption, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project.

Agora recommends using the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode and setting the key and salt.

To generate and set the `key` and `salt` parameters, refer to the following steps.

<div class="alert note"><li>All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt.</li>
<li>Compared to other encryption modes, the <code>GCM2</code> encryption modes use a more secure KDF (Key Derivation Function) and support setting the salt. If you choose other encryption modes, you only need to set the encryption mode and key.</li></div>

#### Generate and set the key

1. Refer to the following command to randomly generate a 32-byte key in the string format through OpenSSL on your server.

 ```shell
 # Randomly generate a 32-byte key in the string format, and pass the string key in the encryptionKey parameter of enableEncryption.
 openssl rand -hex 32
 dba643c8ba6b6dc738df43d9fd624293b4b12d87a60f518253bd10ba98c48453
 ```

2. The client gets the `key` in the string format from the server and passes it to the SDK in the `enableEncryption` method.

#### Generate and set the salt

1. Refer to the following command to randomly generate a Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt through OpenSSL on the server. You can also refer to the [C++ sample code](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools/blob/master/DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey/cpp/sample/RtcChannelEncryptionSaltSample.cpp) provided by Agora on GitHub to randomly generate a salt in the byte array format and convert it to Base64 on the server.

 ```shell
 # Randomly generate a 32-byte salt in the Base64 format. Convert the salt from Base64 to uint8_t, and pass the uint8_t salt in the encryptionKdfSalt parameter of enableEncryption.
 openssl rand -base64 32
 X5w9T+50kzxVOnkJKiY/lUk82/bES2kATOt3vBuGEDw=
 ```

2. The client gets the Base64 salt from the server.

3. The client converts the salt from Base64 to byte[], and then passes it to the SDK in the `enableEncryption` method.

#### Call `enableEncryption` to enable built-in encryption

Before connecting to a channel, call `enableEncryption` to enable built-in encryption. You also need to set encryption mode and encryption key. All users connected to the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key.
