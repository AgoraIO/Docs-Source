5. **Choose this sample in the reference app**

    From the main screen of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, choose **<Vpd k="NAME" />** from the dropdown and then select **Custom video and audio**.

6. **Test the custom audio source**

    Press **Join**. You hear the audio file streamed to the web demo app. 

    To use this code for streaming data from your particular custom audio source, modify the `readBuffer()` method to read the audio data from your source, instead of a raw audio file.

7. **Test the custom video source**

    Add code to the basic framework presented above, to do the following:

    1. In `onSurfaceTextureAvailable` enable the video source and set its parameters.

    1. In `onSurfaceTextureAvailable` set `SurfaceTexture` of the custom video source to `previewSurfaceTexture`.

    1. In `onFrameAvailable` convert `surfaceTexture` data to a `VideoFrame`.
