This section introduces how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project. The basic API call sequence is shown in the figure below: 

![Screen Share Process](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-android-ios.svg)

Depending on the actual business scenario, you can choose either of the following methods to call the API to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

- Call `startScreenCapture` before joining the channel, then call `joinChannelByToken [2/4]` to join the channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

- Call `startScreenCapture` after joining the channel, then call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to update the channel media options and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

### Set up the audio scenario

Call the `setAudioScenario` method and set the audio scenario to `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming` (high-quality scenario) to improve the success rate of capturing system audio during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

### Enable screen capture

1. Call `startScreenCapture` to start screen capture and set the parameters according to your application scenario:

    - `captureVideo`: Whether to capture system video during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
    - `captureAudio`: Whether to capture system audio during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
    - `captureSignalVolume`: The volume of the captured system audio.
    - `dimensions`: Resolution of video encoding.
    - `frameRate`: Video encoding frame rate (FPS).
    - `bitrate`: Video encoding bitrate (Kbps).
    - `contentHint`: Content type of <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video.

    ``` swift
    // Set parameters for screen capture
    private lazy var screenParams: AgoraScreenCaptureParameters2 = {
            let params = AgoraScreenCaptureParameters2()
            params.captureVideo = true
            params.captureAudio = true
            let audioParams = AgoraScreenAudioParameters()
            // Set the captured system volume
            audioParams.captureSignalVolume = 50
            params.audioParams = audioParams
            let videoParams = AgoraScreenVideoParameters()
            // Set the resolution of the shared screen
            videoParams.dimensions = screenShareVideoDimension()
            // Set the video encoding frame rate
            videoParams.frameRate = .FPS15
            // Set the video encoding bitrate
            videoParams.bitrate = AgoraVideoBitrateStandard
            params.videoParams = videoParams
            return params
        }()
    // Enable screen capture
    agoraKit.startScreenCapture(screenParams)
    ```

1. Combine this with a manual action by the user to make the app turn on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />. There are two ways to do this:

    1. Prompt the user to long click the **screen recording** button in the **Control Center** on iOS and choose to use the extension you created to start recording.
    
    2. Use Apple's new [RPSystemBroadcastPickerView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit/rpsystembroadcastpickerview) in iOS 12.0 to make the **Enable Screen Sharing** button pop up on the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> interface, prompting the user to click the button to start recording. The sample code is as follows:

        ``` swift
        let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y:0, width: 60, height: 60)
        systemBroadcastPicker = RPSystemBroadcastPickerView(frame: frame)
        systemBroadcastPicker?.showsMicrophoneButton = false
        systemBroadcastPicker?.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleTopMargin, .flexibleRightMargin]
        // Get the Bundle Identifier of the main application
        let bundleId = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? ""
        // Set the Extension Name
        systemBroadcastPicker?.preferredExtension = "\(bundleId).Agora-ScreenShare-Extension"
        ```

        <Admonition type="caution" title="caution">`RPSystemBroadcastPickerView` has some usage limitations and may become invalid in subsequent versions of iOS. </Admonition>

### Publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream in a channel

After joining the channel, call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to publish the captured <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as follows:

    ``` swift
    // Define the behavior of rtcEngine when performing screen video capture (state is capturing, sourceType is screen)
    func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, localVideoStateChangedOf state: AgoraVideoLocalState, error: AgoraLocalVideoStreamError, sourceType: AgoraVideoSourceType) {
        switch (state, sourceType) {
        case (.capturing, .screen):
            // Publish screen captured videos in the channel
            option.publishScreenCaptureVideo = true
            // Publish screen captured videos in the channel
            option.publishScreenCaptureAudio = true
            // Avoid release of camera-captured video
            option.publishCameraTrack = false
            // Update the channel settings with the options set above
            agoraKit.updateChannel(with: option)

        default: break
        }
    }
    ```

### Set up a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scene (Optional)

Call the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method to set the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario. Choose the `scenarioType` that best fits your application from the following:

- `AgoraScreenScenarioDocument`: Document scene
- `AgoraScreenScenarioGaming`: Game scene
- `AgoraScreenScenarioVideo`: Video scene
- `AgoraScreenScenarioRDC`: Remote control scene

``` swift
agoraKit.setScreenCaptureScenario(.video)
```

### Update <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> (Optional)

If you want to update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters, such as the video encoding resolution, frame rate, or bit rate, call `updateScreenCapture` to modify the parameter values.

``` swift
agoraKit.updateScreenCapture(screenParams)
```

### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Call `stopScreenCapture` to stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> within the channel. 

``` swift
agoraKit.stopScreenCapture()
// Stop sharing captured video in the channel
option.publishScreenCaptureVideo = false
// Stop sharing captured audio in the channel
option.publishScreenCaptureAudio = false
// Publish camera video in the channel
option.publishCameraTrack = true
agoraKit.updateChannel(with: option)
```

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- After turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the resolution of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as the billing standard. Please see [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details. The default resolution is 1280 Ã— 720, but you can adjust it according to your business needs.
- Due to system limitations, <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is only supported on iOS 12.0 and above.
- This feature requires a high level of device performance. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that you use an iPhone X or above.
- After the user turns on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on an iOS device, the audio routing automatically switches to the earpiece due to system limitations.
    - If you are using **call volume**, you can manually switch the audio routing. For example, you can switch the audio routing to speaker as desired.
    - If you are using **media volume**, you cannot manually switch audio routing due to system limitations.
