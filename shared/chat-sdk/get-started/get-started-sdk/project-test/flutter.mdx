To validate the peer-to-peer messaging you have just integrated into your app using Agora Chat, perform the following operations to test the project:

1. Log in  
a. Replace the placeholders of `appKey`, `userId`, and `agoraToken` in the [`AgoraChatConfig`](#sign-in) class with the App Key, user ID, and Agora token of the sender (`flutter001`).  
b. Select the device to run the project, run `flutter run` in the `quick_start` directory, and click the **SIGN IN** button.

2. Send a message  
Fill in the user ID of the receiver (`flutter002`) in the **Enter recipient's user Id** box, type in the message ("hello") to send in the **Enter message** box, and click **SEND TEXT** to send the message.

b. Select the device to run the project, run `flutter run` in the `quick_start` directory, and receive the message "hello" sent in step 2.
