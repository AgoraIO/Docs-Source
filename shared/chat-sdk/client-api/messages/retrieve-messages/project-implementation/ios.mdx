### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```objective-c
pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

Refer to the following code sample:

```objective-c
AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption* option = [[AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption alloc] init];
    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager fetchMessagesFromServerBy:@"conversationId" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeGroupChat cursor:@"" pageSize:20 option:option completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatMessage *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Pin a conversation

You can use the `EMChatManager#pinMessage` method to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room session will receive the `EMChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will also receive the `EMChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

By default, 20 messages can be pinned to the top in a single conversation. You can [contact support](mailto:support@agora.io) to increase this limit, with the maximum adjustable to 100.

```objc
EMClient.shared().chatManager?.pinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Pinning successful
    }
})
```

### Unpin the conversation

You can call `EMChatManager#unpinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. Similar to pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room session will receive `EMChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will also receive the `EMChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event.

All members of a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After the pinned message is unpinned, the information in `EMMessagePinInfo` will be empty, and the message will no longer be included in the pinned message list of the conversation.

```objc
EMClient.shared().chatManager?.unpinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Unpinning successful
    }
})
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server

You can call `EMChatManager#getPinnedMessages` the method to get the pinned message list of a single session from the server. The SDK returns messages in reverse order of top time.
<Admonition type="alert" info="Note">
- If the message expires on the server after being pinned to the top, or the user deletes the message one-way from the server, the current user cannot pull the message when pulling roaming messages, but the current user and other users can pull it from the pinned message list. the message.
- If the user withdraws the message after it is pinned to the top, the message will be removed from the server, and all users will not be able to pull the message when pulling the pinned message list from the server.
</Admonition>
```objc
EMClient.shared().chatManager?.getPinnedMessages(fromServer: "conversationId", completion: { messages, err in
    if err == nil, let messages = messages {
        // Successfully retrieved the list of pinned messages
    }
})
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```objective-c
// Delete messages by timestamp
AgoraChatConversation* conversation = [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId"];
    [conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:timeToRemove completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
// Delete messages by message ID
 [conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"msgId1",@"msgId2"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages  from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```
