A <Vg k="SIG" /> client must establish a connection with the server before it can access network resources. API calls, messages, and events in the channel are transmitted through network connections. While the <Vpd k="SDK" /> manages establishing and maintaining network connections, understanding its management mechanism helps you handle potential network errors in the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, and improves the end user experience.

This page shows how to manage the connection between the <Vpd k="SDK" /> and the <Vg k="SIG" /> server. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.
