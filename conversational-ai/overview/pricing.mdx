This page introduces the billing policy for the use of <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

<Admonition type="info">
Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.
</Admonition>

When you use <Vpd k="NAME" /> in your project, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> charges a fee in your monthly bill. See [Billing](/voice-calling/reference/billing-policies#billing) for details. At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates the total usage of <Vpd k="NAME" /> across all projects under your developer account, subtracts the free quota, and multiplies the remaining usage by the corresponding unit price to calculate the total cost. The final amount is rounded to two decimal places.

## Unit price

The cost of using <Vpd k="NAME" /> consists of:

- **User call charges**: When a user joins an RTC channel, you incur a user call charge at the rate of 0.00099 USD/minute. For further information, see [Pricing](/voice-calling/overview/pricing).

- **Agent call fee**: When you call the server API to create a <Vpd k="AGENT" /> and the agent joins the channel, the call incurs an additional agent call fee at the rate of 0.0265 USD/minute.

|:--------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------|
| User call charges	 | 0.00099 | 10,000 minutes per month |

## Example
