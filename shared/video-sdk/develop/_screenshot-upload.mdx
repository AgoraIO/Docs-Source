Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to take screenshots of the video stream in a channel and upload images to a specified third-party cloud storage to meet the needs of video content supervision.

## Understand the tech

When you enable the screenshot upload function, you set the interval after which <Vg k="VSDK" /> takes a screenshot of videos sent by local users and uploads the image to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. The <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uploads the screenshot to the third-party cloud storage you configure and sends a callback notification to your server in the form of an `HTTPS` request.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

* Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.
<Prerequisites />

## Project setup

Take the following steps to set up your project for screenshot upload: 

* Configure a third-party cloud storage account for storing screenshots.

* Implement a webhook to receive [HTTP message notifications](#http-message-notification) from <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

* Enable and configure the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> video screenshot upload service and activate the video content moderation service by submitting a request to support@agora.io.

### Video screenshot upload dynamic library

For details about the Video screenshot upload dynamic library and the increase in size of the integrated app for each architecture, see [App size optimization](../reference/downloads#plugin-list).

### HTTP message notification

After a screenshot is successfully uploaded to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, the Agora service sends a message notification callback to your application server in the form of an `HTTPS POST` request. The data format is `JSON`, and the character encoding is `UTF-8`.

After receiving a message notification, your application server responds with a status code of `200`. The response packet body format is `JSON`. Agora considers the notification to have failed under any of the following circumstances:

* The Agora service does not receive a response from your server within 5 seconds after sending the message notification.

* The HTTP status code of the response is not `200`, or the response body format is not `JSON`.

The Agora service retries immediately after the first notification failure, and sends a message notification again. It makes a total of three notification attempts.

### HTTP Request
