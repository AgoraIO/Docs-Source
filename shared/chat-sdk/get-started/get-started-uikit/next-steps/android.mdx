For demonstration purposes, Agora Chat provides an app server that enables you to quickly retrieve a token using the App Key given in this guide. In a production context, the best practice is for you to deploy your own token server, use your own [App Key](.enable_agora_chat?platform=Android#get-the-information-of-the-agora-chat-project) to generate a token, and retrieve the token on the client side to log in to Agora. To see how to implement a server that generates and serves tokens on request, see [Generate a User Token](./generate_user_tokens?platform=All%20Platforms).
