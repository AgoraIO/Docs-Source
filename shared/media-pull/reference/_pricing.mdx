	**Audio transcoding charges** = Audio transcoding unit price × Audio transcoding service minutes.
- Video transcoding charges: If you inject a video stream or an audio and video stream into an <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel, video transcoding charges occur.

	**Video transcoding charges** = Video transcoding unit price × Video transcoding service minutes.

## Subscription charges
When you successfully inject an online stream into an <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel, which generates subscription charges. Subscription charges are included in the charges for real-time communications.
