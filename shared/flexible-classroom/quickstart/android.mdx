1. **Sync the Android project**

   Android Studio automatically performs a gradle sync to downloads the dependencies.

1. **Update the parameters**

   Copy your *App ID* and *App Certificate* from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/) and replace the values of *agora_app_id* and *agora_app_cert* in `CloudClass-Android\app\src\main\res\values\string_config.xml`.


## Test your implementation

1. Connect a physical Android device to your development device.

1. In Android Studio, click **Run app**. A moment later, the project is installed on your device.

1. In the login screen, enter the **Room**, your **Name**, the class **Type**, your **Role** and your current **Region**, then click **Enter**.
