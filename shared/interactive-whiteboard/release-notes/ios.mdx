## v2.16.46

v2.16.46 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Whiteboard tool updates**

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Pencil: Adds support for drawing dotted lines by setting `room.memberState.dottedLine` as `true`.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by setting `room.memberState.textCanSelectText` as `true`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Floatbar**

This release adds the floatbar feature. The floatbar pops up when selecting any whiteboard item, which enables users to
easily edit these whiteboard items. For example, when selecting a stroke, the floatbar enables the user to remove it or change its color.
When selecting some text, the floatbar enables the user to adjust its style or change its typeface.

Modify the `floatBar` parameter in the `WhiteRoomConfig` interface to enable floatbar.

**3. Take screenshots**

This release adds `getLocalSnapShotWithCompletion` in the `WhiteDisplayer` class to take a screenshot of the current whiteboard page.

**4. Request slide log**

This release adds the `requestSlideLogToFilePath` method in the `WhiteSDK` class to write the slide log into a specified file.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- The SDK now automatically tries to recover after the whiteboard crashes due to insufficient web memory. If you have previously
configured `navigationDelegate`, you need to undo that to apply this optimization. In addition, this release adds the
`startRecoveringFromMemoryIssues` and `endRecoveringFromMemoryIssues` callbacks to report when the SDK starts to recover and
finishes its recovery, respectively.
- You can now pause or resume audio mixing or playback in dynamic PPT files with the `pauseAudioMixing` and `resumeAudioMixing` methods.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The creation of the whiteboard app sometimes failed after reconnection.
- When creating the whiteboard app, synchronizing the initial height and width sometimes failed.
- The `WhiteBroadcastState` sometimes failed to initialize when joining the room.
- When using a non-ApplePencil stylus on the iPad, calling `drawOnlyPencil` sometimes caused the whiteboard to crash.
- Calling `drawOnlyPencil` sometimes reported an error when the user did not have write permissions.
- Switching the readable/writable state sometimes caused the configuration to be lost in the `disableCameraTransform` of `mainView`.

#### API changes

**Added**

- New properties in the `MemberState` class: `dottedLine` and `textCanSelectText`
- `pauseAudioMixing`
- `resumeAudioMixing`
- New parameter in the `WhiteRoomConfig` interface: `floatBar`
- New type in `WhiteApplianceNameKey`: `AppliancePencilEraser`
- `requestSlideLogToFilePath`
- `startRecoveringFromMemoryIssues`
- `endRecoveringFromMemoryIssues`
- `getLocalSnapShotWithCompletion`

## v2.16.24

v2.16.24 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Inserting text**

This release adds the `insertText` method to `WhiteRoom` for inserting text at a specified position.

**2. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `disableNewPencilStroke` property to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of `disableNewPencilStroke` is `YES`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you call `disableNewPencil(NO)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `disableNewPencil(NO)`, you can call `disableNewPencilStroke(YES)`.

**3. Getting the scene information**

This release adds the `getSceneFromScenePath` method to the `WhiteDisplayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

**4. Setting whether to only allow drawing and writing using the Apple Pencil**

This release supports setting whether to only allow users to draw and write on the whiteboard using the Apple Pencil on iPad. Before joining a whiteboard room, you can set this by using the `drawOnlyApplePencil` property in `WhiteRoomConfig`; after joining a whiteboard room, you can call the `setDrawOnlyApplePencil` method in `WhiteRoom` to change the setting.

**5. Support for YYKit** 

The Agora Whiteboard SDK for iOS uses [YYModel](https://github.com/ibireme/YYModel) for data type conversion by default. As of this release, the SDK adds support for YYKit. To use [YYKit](https://github.com/ibireme/YYKit), you need to add the following line to the `Podfile` file to add the dependency:

```
pod 'Whiteboard/Whiteboard-YYKit'
```

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Adds tween animation for the new pencil. This allows the SDK to automatically insert frames between keyframes when a user draws or writes with the new pencil, so that remote users see a smoother drawing process. To experience this improvement, ensure that you have called `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- The virtual keyboard did not pop up when clicking `text` on iOS browsers.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.

## v2.15.23

v2.15.23 was released on January 21, 2022.

This release provides the following improvements:

- Updates `white-web-sdk` to v2.15.16.
- Optimizes `getSceneSnapshotImage` and `getScenePreviewImage` to ensure the images inserted in the scene are displayed correctly in the screenshot.

## v2.15.0

v2.15.0 was released on November 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

To simplify APIs, this release deletes the `joinRoomWithUuid` and `joinRoomWithRoomUuid` methods, and keeps only the `joinRoomWithConfig` method.

At the same time, to help you manage users in a room, this release adds the `uid` parameter in `initWithUuid` of the `WhiteRoomConfig` class, for setting the unique identifier of a user.

If you upgrade the SDK to v2.15.0 or later, to join a room, you must call `joinRoomWithConfig`, and ensure that you pass in a string `uid` in `initWithUuid` when initializing the `WhiteRoomConfig` object. The `uid` of each user cannot be longer than 1024 bytes and must be unique in the same room. For more information, see [Join a Whiteboard Room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-sdk#3-initialize-the-sdk-and-join-a-room).
