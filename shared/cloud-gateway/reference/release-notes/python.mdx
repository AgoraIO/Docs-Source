### v2.1.0

v2.1.0 was released on December 11, 2024.

This is the first version of the Server Gateway for Python.

#### New features

**Media streams transmission**

Server Gateway supports various audio and video encoding formats, such as H.264, H.265, Vp8 for video, and OPUS, G722, PCMA for audio. You can send and receive multiple types of audio and video data without being restricted by audio and video devices.

**Data streams transmission**

Server Gateway supports sending and receiving data stream messages, applicable to use-cases requiring message transmission. For example, a chat application can use this feature to implement instant messaging between users.

**Multiple channels**

Server Gateway supports sending or receiving media streams in multiple channels simultaneously, applicable to use-cases requiring multiple channel management. For example, an online education platform can conduct live classes for multiple classes simultaneously, ensuring that the audio and video data for each class does not interfere with one another.

**Subscribing to specific users**

You can selectively subscribe to specific users' media streams using their user IDs. For example, in a large conference, attendees can subscribe only to the speaker's media stream, saving bandwidth and improving efficiency.

**Audio mixing**

Server Gateway supports mixing multiple audio streams, applicable to use-cases where multiple users or devices are sending streams simultaneously. For example, an online concert can mix audio streams from guitar, drums, and vocals into a high-quality audio stream for the audience.

**Cloud proxy**

Server Gateway allows access to Agora services within an intranet by whitelisting specific IPs and ports on the firewall. It is applicable to large enterprises, hospitals, universities, banks, and other institutions with high security requirements, ensuring a secure and stable connection.
