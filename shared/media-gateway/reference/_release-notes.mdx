This page provides the release notes for <Vpd k="NAME" />.

## 2025.5.28

#### New features

- **Low-bitrate high-quality streaming**

    Video transcoding now supports low-bitrate high-quality streaming through PVC (Perceptual Video Coding) and Super Resolution features. Enable these features when creating, resetting, or updating stream configuration templates using the `pvc` and `superResolution` objects under `transcoding.video.advancedOptions`.  
    For configuration details, see [PVC and Super Quality configuration](../advanced/low-bitrate-hd).

- **Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)**

    Stream configuration templates now support ABR functionality. With video transcoding enabled, configure multi-bitrate encoding through the `simulcastStreamLayers` object when creating, resetting, or updating templates.  
    For configuration details, see [Enable Adaptive Bitrate](../advanced/abr).

- **SRT streaming protocol support**

    Gateway nodes now support the SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) streaming protocol with the following codec formats:

    - Video: H.264, H.265
    - Audio: AAC, OPUS

    For configuration details, see [SRT streaming](../best-practices/srt-streaming).

#### Improvements

- **NCS callback configuration by VID**

    Configure NCS callback logic by VID. For the `live_profile_updated`(4) event, you can configure which `profile` fields are required.

- **NCS callback event updates**

    This version updates the format of NCS callback events, including:

    - `live_stream_connected`(1): Now includes transcoding parameter configuration information for the current stream
    - `live_stream_disconnected`(2): Now includes total input and output bytes for the stream, enabling average bitrate calculation when combined with stream start and end times

## 2024.8.21

This release includes the following updates:

- Adds support for a backup primary domain name and a secondary domain name to ensure service availability.
- Adds the `mode` field for setting the transcoding mode, and updates `width`, `height`, and `fps` fields to support more transcoding options.

## 2024.6.21
