### Presence configuration

To configure presence, go to **All features** > **Signaling** > **Presence Configuration** in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and set the following:

- **Max number of instant events**

    Sets the maximum number of instant notifications that can be sent. After reaching this limit, <Vg k="SIG" /> switches to interval mode for sending notifications. The value range is 8–128, with a default value of 50. If your specific requirement is beyond this range, contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

- **Timed event notification interval**

    Sets how often periodic notifications are sent. The value range is 5–300 seconds, with a default value is 30 seconds.

- **Event notification debounce time**

    Specifies the time interval within which no presence event is triggered if a user quickly leaves and re-joins. The default value is 2 seconds.

### Activate stream channels

The activation of Stream Channel functionality in Signaling directly depends on the activation of the 128-host feature in Real-Time Communication (RTC). To ensure proper activation:

1. Submit a formal request to [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).
2. Specifically request activation of the 128-host feature.
3. Wait for confirmation before implementing Stream Channel features.

For further assistance or questions regarding this requirement, please contact [Agora Support]((mailto:support@agora.io)).
