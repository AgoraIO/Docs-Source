### Send a message

Follow the steps to create and send a message, and listen for the result of sending the message.

1. Use the `ChatMessage` class to create a message.

```dart
// Sets the message type. Agora Chat supports 8 message types.
MessageType messageType = MessageType.TXT;
// Sets `targetId` to the user ID of the peer user in one-to-one chat, group ID in group chat, and chat room ID in room chat.
String targetId = "tom";
// Sets `chatType` as `Chat`, `GroupChat`, or `ChatRoom` for one-to-one chat, group chat, or room chat.
ChatType chatType = ChatType.Chat;
// Creates a message. Parameters vary with message types.
// Creates a text message.
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    content: "This is text message",
);
// Creates an image message. You need to set the local path, length, and width of the image file, and the image name displayed on the UI.
String imgPath = "/data/.../image.jpg";
double imgWidth = 100;
double imgHeight = 100;
String imgName = "image.jpg";
int imgSize = 3000;
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createImageSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    filePath: imgPath,
    width: imgWidth,
    height: imgHeight,
    displayName: imgName,
    fileSize: imgSize,
);
// Creates a CMD message. A CMD message contains a command for the recipient to take action. You can customize the command.
String action = "writing";
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createCmdSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    action: action,
);
// Creates a custom message. A custom message contains the message event type and the extension field.
// You can customize the extension field according to your use case.
String event = "gift";
Map<String, String> params = {"key": "value"};
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createCustomSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    event: event,
    params: params,
);
// Creates a file message. A file message contains the local file path and the name displayed on the UI.
String filePath = "data/.../foo.zip";
String fileName = "foo.zip";
int fileSize = 6000;
ChatMessage fileMsg = ChatMessage.createFileSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    filePath: filePath,
    displayName: fileName,
    fileSize: fileSize,
);
// Creates a location message. You need to set the longitude and latitude information of the location, as well as the name of the location.
// To send a location message, you need to integrate a third-party map service provider to get the longitude and latitude information of the location. When the recipient receives the location information, the service provider renders the location on the map according to the longitude and latitude information.
double latitude = 114.78;
double longitude = 39.89;
String address = "darwin";
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createLocationSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    latitude: latitude,
    longitude: longitude,
    address: address,
);
// Creates a video message. A video message includes two attachment files, including the video file and the thumbnail of the video. The SDK uses the first frame of the video as the thumbnail. You also need to set the local path, length, width, display name, and duration of the video file.
String videoPath = "data/.../foo.mp4";
double videoWidth = 100;
double videoHeight = 100;
String videoName = "foo.mp4";
int videoDuration = 5;
int videoSize = 4000;
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createVideoSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    filePath: videoPath,
    width: videoWidth,
    height: videoHeight,
    duration: videoDuration,
    fileSize: videoSize,
    displayName: videoName,
);
// Creates a voice message. A voice message contains the local path, display name, and duration of the audio file.
String voicePath = "data/.../foo.wav";
String voiceName = "foo.wav";
int voiceDuration = 5;
int voiceSize = 1000;
ChatMessage.createVoiceSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    filePath: voicePath,
    duration: voiceDuration,
    fileSize: voiceSize,
    displayName: voiceName,
);
```

2. Send the message using `sendMessage` in `ChatManager`.

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(message).then((value) {
});
```

To get the progress and result of the message sending, you need to implement `ChatManager#addMessageEvent`. For CMD messages which do not necessarily need a result, you do not need to set the callback.

```dart
// Adds a message status listener.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addMessageEvent(
    "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
    ChatMessageEvent(
        // Occurs when the message sending succeeds. You can update the message and add other operations in this callback.
        onSuccess: (msgId, msg) {
        // msgId: The pre-sending message ID.
        // msg: The message that is sent successfully.
        },
        // Occurs when the message sending fails. You can update the message status and add other operations in this callback.
        onError: (msgId, msg, error) {
        // msgId: The pre-sending message ID.
        // msg: The message that fails to be sent.
        // error: The error description.
        },
        // For attachment messages such as image, voice, file, and video, you can get a progress value for uploading or downloading them in this callback.
        onProgress: (msgId, progress) {
        // msgId: The pre-sending message ID.
        // progress: The sending progress.
        },
    ),
);
void dispose() {
    // Removes the message status listener.
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.removeMessageEvent("UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID");
    super.dispose();
}
// The result of the messaging sending is returned in the callback. The return value of the method only indicates the result of the message call.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(message).then((value) {
   // Finishes sending the message.
});
```

### Set message priority

In high-concurrency scenarios, you can set a certain message type or messages from a chat room member as high, normal, or low priority.
In this case, low-priority messages are dropped first to reserve resources for the high-priority ones, for example, gifts and announcements, when the server is overloaded.
This ensures that the high-priority messages can be dealt with first when loads of messages are being sent in high concurrency or high frequency.
Note that this feature can increase the delivery reliability of high-priority messages, but cannot guarantee the deliveries.
Even high-priorities messages can be dropped when the server load goes too high.

You can set the priority for all types of messages in the chat room.

```dart
// Set the priority of the chat room message. The default priority is `Normal`, indicating the normal priority.
if (msg.chatType == ChatType.ChatRoom) {
    msg.chatroomMessagePriority = ChatRoomMessagePriority.High;
}
```

### Receive the message

You can use `ChatEventHandler` to listen for message events. You can add multiple `ChatEventHandler` objects to listen for multiple events. When you no longer listen for an event, for example, when you call `dispose`, ensure that you remove the object.

When a message arrives, the recipient receives an `onMessagesReceived` callback. Each callback contains one or more messages. You can traverse the message list, and parse and render these messages in this callback.

```dart
// Adds a chat event handler.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
    "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
    ChatEventHandler(
        onMessagesReceived: (messages) {},
    ),
);
...
// Removes the chat event handler.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.removeEventHandler("UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID");
```

When a voice message is received, the SDK automatically downloads the audio file.

For image and video messages, the SDK automatically generates a thumbnail when you create the message. When an image or video message is received, the SDK automatically downloads the thumbnail. To manually download the attachment files, follow the steps:

1. Set `isAutoDownloadThumbnail` as true when initializing the SDK.

```dart
ChatOptions options = ChatOptions(
    appKey: "<#Your AppKey#>",
    isAutoDownloadThumbnail: false,
);
```

2. Set the status callback for the download.

```dart
// Adds a message status listener.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addMessageEvent(
    "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
    ChatMessageEvent(
        // Occurs when the message is downloaded successfully.
        onSuccess: (msgId, msg) {
        // msgId: The message ID.
        // msg: The message that is downloaded successfully.
        },
        // Occurs when the message fails to be downloaded.
        onError: (msgId, msg, error) {
        // msgId: The message ID.
        // msg: The message that fails to be downloaded.
        // error: The reason for the download failure.
        },
        // For attachment messages such as image, voice, file, and video, you can get a progress value for uploading or downloading them in this callback.
        onProgress: (msgId, progress) {
        // msgId: The message ID.
        // progress: The upload or download progress.
        },
    ),
);
void dispose() {
    // Removes the message status listener.
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.removeMessageEvent("UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID");
    super.dispose();
}
```

3. Download the thumbnail and get the path to it.

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.downloadThumbnail(message);
```

  Get the path to the thumbnail from the `thumbnailLocalPath` member in the message body.

```dart
// Get the message body of the image file.
ChatImageMessageBody imgBody = message.body as ChatImageMessageBody;
// Get the local path to the thumbnail.
String? thumbnailLocalPath = imgBody.thumbnailLocalPath;
```

4. Call `downloadAttachment` to download the file.

  ```dart
  ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.downloadAttachment(message);
  ```

  Get the path to the attachment from the `localPath` member in the message body.

  ```dart
  // Get the message body.
  ChatFileMessageBody fileBody = message.body as ChatFileMessageBody;
  // Get the local path of the file.
  String? localPath = fileBody.localPath;
  ```

### Recall a message

After a message is sent, you can recall it. The `recallMessage` method recalls a message that is saved both locally and on the server, whether it is a historical message, offline message or a roaming message on the server, or a message in the memory or local database of the message sender or recipient.

The default time limit for recalling a message is two minutes. You can extend this time frame to up to 7 days in Agora Console. To do so, select a project that enables Agora Chat, then click **Configure** > **Features** > **Message recall**.

![message-recall](/images/chat/message-recall.png)

<div class="alert info">1. Except CMD messages, you can recall all types of message. 2. If an attachment message, like an image, voice, video, or file message, is recalled, the attachment of the message is also deleted.</div>

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.recallMessage(msgId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
```

You can also use `ChatEventHandler` to listen for the state of recalling the message:

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
    "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
    ChatEventHandler(
    onMessagesRecalled: (messages) {},
    ),
);
```


### Use message extensions

If the message types listed above do not meet your requirements, you can use message extensions to add attributes to the message. This can be applied in more complicated messaging scenarios.

```typescript
try {
  final msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
    targetId: targetId,
    content: 'content',
  );

  msg.attributes = {'k': 'v'};
  ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
} on ChatError catch (e) {}

```

### Forward multiple messages

Supported types for forwarded messages include text, images, audio & video files, attachment, and custom messages. A user can create a combined message with a list of original messages and send it. When receiving a combined message, the recipient can select it and other messages to create a new layered combined message. A combined message can contain up to 10 layers of messages, with at most 300 messages at each layer.

To forward and receive combined messages, refer to the following code:

1. Create a combined message using multiple message IDs:

    ```dart
    String title = "Historical messages for one-to-one chats between A and B";
    String summary =
        "A: These are historical messages from A. \nB: These are historical messages from B.";
    String compatibleText =
        "Your current version does not support this type of message. Please upgrade to the latest version.";
    final msg = ChatMessage.createCombineSendMessage(
        targetId: targetId,
        msgIds: msgIds,
        title: title,
        summary: summary,
        compatibleText: compatibleText,
    );
    await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
    ```

2. Download and parse combined messages:

    ```dart
    List<ChatMessage> list =
        await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchCombineMessageDetail(
    message: combineMessage,
    );
    ```

For further details see [Multiple messages forwarding limitations](../../reference/limitations#multiple-messages-forwarding-limitations).

### Modify sent messages

Every end user or chat group member may edit messages that they have sent. The client API below, when called, will allow the SDK to modify a message.

There is no time limit for modifying a message, that is, it can be modified as long as the message is still stored on the server. After the message is modified, the message life cycle, that is, its storage time on the server, is recalculated. For example, a message can be stored on the server for 180 days, and the user modifies it on the 30th day after the message was sent. Instead of remaining 150 days, the message can be now stored on the server for 180 days after successful modification.

In the modified message, the message ID remains unchanged. Only the message content is edited and the following items are added:

* The operator ID of the user performing the action.
* The operation time that indicates when the message was edited.
* The number of times a message is edited (up to 10 times).

For the edited message, except the message body, other information included in the message like the message sender, recipient, and message extension attributes remain unchanged.

To modify a sent message, refer to the following code:

1. Call `modifyMessage` with the message ID and the new message body:

    ```dart
    ChatTextMessageBody body = ChatTextMessageBody(content: "new content");
    await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.modifyMessage(
        messageId: msgId,
        msgBody: body,
    );
    ```

1. Receive notification of messages modified by other users:

    ```dart
    ChatEventHandler(
            onMessageContentChanged: (message, operatorId, operationTime) {},
    )
    ```

For further details see [Sent message modification limitations](../../reference/limitations#sent-message-modification-limitations).
