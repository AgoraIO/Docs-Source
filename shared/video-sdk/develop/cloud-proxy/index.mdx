Large enterprises, hospitals, universities, banks, and other institutions commonly deploy firewalls to meet their stringent security requirements. To ensure uninterrupted access to its services for enterprise users behind firewalls, Agora offers firewall whitelist and <Vg k="CP" /> services.

Admins enable users to use <Vpd k="SDK" /> in network-restricted environments by adding specific IP addresses and ports to the firewall whitelist. Users make API calls to configure the <Vg k="CP" /> service.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="CP" /> works as follows:

1. <Vpd k="SDK" /> initiates a request to <Vg k="CP" />.
1. <Vg k="CP" /> returns the corresponding proxy information.
1. Agora SDK sends data to <Vg k="CP" />. <Vg k="CP" /> receives the data and transmits it to Agora SD-RTN™.
1. Agora SD-RTN™ returns data to <Vg k="CP" />. <Vg k="CP" /> receives the data and sends it to the SDK.
