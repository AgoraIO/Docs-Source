1. Clone this Git repository for sample code for windows by executing the following command in a terminal window:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-windows
    ```
2. Replace the `video-sdk-samples-windows/agora_manager/SDK` with the latest Agora Video SDK, you downloaded and unzipped to a local folder.
3. Create a folder at your solution directory (`video-sdk-samples-windows/agora_manager`) named `<selected solution platform(x64 or x86)>/<selected solution Configuration Mode(Debug or Release)>` like for this sample create a nested folder (`x64/Debug`).To achieve this, first create a folder named `x64`, and then within that folder, create another folder named `Debug`.
4. Copy the contents of `video-sdk-samples-windows/agora_manager/SDK/x86_64` to  `video-sdk-samples-windows/agora_manager/x64/Debug`.
5. **Install the required third party liberaries through vcpkg:**

	1. Install `vcpkg` :
	
		To install required library
		```bash
		1. Open command prompt and navigate to video-sdk-samples-windows:
		2. git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git  
		3. cd vcpkg
		4. .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
		```
	1. Install required packages :

		Install vcpkag packages as per the project need.Please note we need to install x64-windows version of libreraries, as this sample is 64-bit version of Windows.  
		```bash
		.\vcpkg.exe install jsoncpp:x64-windows  
		.\vcpkg.exe install curl:x64-windows
		.\vcpkg.exe install opencv:x64-windows    
		```
	1. Ensure `vcpkg` integration with Visual Studio:

		Make sure you have integrated `vcpkg` with Visual Studio. After cloning vcpkg and installing libraries, you need to run the integration command:
		```bash
		.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
		```
		The integration command should yield a confirmation message denoting successful integration with Visual Studio. Notably, this integration is a one-time requirement for a specific system, regardless of the number of repositories created therein.
