This guide shows you how to configure voice assistants in the <Vpd k="NAME" /> playground. You can build assistants using traditional speech recognition, language processing, and speech synthesis (STT + LLM + TTS) pipelines or modern real-time voice-to-voice (V2V) models.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- <Vpd k="NAME" /> playground running. Refer to the [Agent quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.mdx).
- Agora RTC credentials from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/v2)
- API keys for your chosen services
    - For traditional pipeline:
        - STT service like [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/)
        - LLM like [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
        - TTS service like [Fish.Audio](https://fish.audio/)
    - For real-time V2V:
        - Realtime API key from your V2V provider

## Traditional voice assistant

This configuration uses separate services for speech recognition, language processing, and speech synthesis (STT + LLM + TTS).

### Configuration steps

Follow these steps to set up your traditional voice assistant pipeline:

1. Open the playground at `http://localhost:3000`

2. Select the `voice_assistant` graph type

3. Configure modules:
    1. Click **Module Picker**
    1. Select your preferred STT, LLM, and TTS modules
    1. Click **Save Changes**

4. Configure properties:
    1. Click the settings button next to the graph selector
    1. Enter API keys and settings for each module
    1. Click **Save Changes**

5. Connect and test:
    1. Click **Connect** to start the assistant
    1. Wait for the initialization to complete
    1. Begin speaking to interact with the agent

### Azure STT integration

To use Azure STT integrated within the RTC extension module:

1. Select the `voice_assistant_integrated_stt` graph type
2. Configure Azure credentials in the RTC module properties
3. Follow the remaining steps as above

## Real-time voice assistant

Modern voice-to-voice (V2V) models provide lower latency and more natural interactions.

### Configuration steps

Set up your real-time voice assistant with these steps:

1. Open the playground at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select the `voice_assistant_realtime` graph type
3. Configure the V2V module:
    1. Click **Module Picker**
    1. Select your V2V provider
    1. Click **Save Changes**
4. Add API credentials:
    1. Click the settings button
    1. Enter your Realtime API key
    1. Click **Save Changes**
5. Connect and interact:
    1. Click **Connect** to start
    1. Speak naturally with the assistant

## Add tool capabilities

Follow these steps to enhance your assistant with tools:

1. Open **Module Picker** while your agent is running
2. Find your LLM or V2V module
3. Click the tool button next to the module
4. Select a tool. For example, choose the **Weather Tool** from the list
5. Click **Save Changes**

Your assistant can now answer weather-related questions. Try asking "What's the weather in London?"

### Best practices

Follow these guidelines for optimal performance:

- Test each module individually before combining them
- Choose models based on your use case:
 - For low latency, use real-time V2V models
 - For high accuracy, use traditional STT + LLM + TTS pipeline
- Monitor API usage to control costs
- Configure appropriate timeouts for each service

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **No audio input** | <ul><li>Check browser microphone permissions</li><li>Verify RTC credentials are correct</li><li>Ensure microphone is not muted</li></ul> |
| **High latency** | <ul><li>Switch to V2V model for lower latency</li><li>Choose geographically closer API endpoints</li><li>Reduce model complexity settings</li></ul> |
| **Transcription errors** | <ul><li>Speak clearly and at moderate pace</li><li>Reduce background noise</li><li>Try different STT providers</li></ul> |
