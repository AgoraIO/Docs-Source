```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.changeGroupName(groupId, local_name)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("update group name success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("update group name fail.", reason);
  });
```

  .then(() => {
    console.log("update group description success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("update group description fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Update the chat group announcements

Only the chat group owner and admins can call `updateGroupAnnouncement` to set and update the announcements. Once the chat group announcements are updated, all the other chat group members receive the `IGroupManagerDelegate#OnAnnouncementChangedFromGroup` callback. The maximum total length of chat group announcements is 512 characters.

The following code sample shows how to update the chat group announcements:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.updateGroupAnnouncement(groupId, announcement)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("update ann success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("update ann fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Retrieve the chat group announcements

All chat group members can call `fetchAnnouncementFromServer` to retrieve the chat group announcements from the server.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat group announcements:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.fetchAnnouncementFromServer(groupId)
  .then((ann) => {
    console.log("get ann success.", ann);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get ann fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Manage the chat group shared files

#### Upload chat group shared files

All chat group members can call `uploadGroupSharedFile` to upload shared files to a chat group. The maximum file size is 10 MB. Once a shared file is uploaded, all the other chat group members receive the `ChatGroupEventListener#onSharedFileAdded` callback.

The following code sample shows how to upload chat group shared files:

```typescript
// Set the file status callback. This callback is triggered to notify the upload and download progress, and the success and failure state of operations on shared files.
const callback = new (class implements ChatGroupFileStatusCallback {
  that: any;
  constructor(t: any) {
    this.that = t;
  }
  onProgress(groupId: string, filePath: string, progress: number): void {
    console.log(`onProgress: `, groupId, filePath, progress);
  }
  onError(groupId: string, filePath: string, error: ChatError): void {
    console.log(`onError: `, groupId, filePath, error);
  }
  onSuccess(groupId: string, filePath: string): void {
    console.log(`onSuccess: `, groupId, filePath);
  }
})(this);
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.uploadGroupSharedFile(groupId, filePath, callback)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("upload file success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("upload file fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Delete chat group shared files

All chat group members can call `removeGroupSharedFile` to delete shared files in a chat group. Once a shared file is deleted, all the other chat group members receive the `ChatGroupEventListener#onSharedFileDeleted` callback. The chat group owner and chat group admins can delete all of the shared files, whereas chat group members can only delete the shared files that they have personally uploaded.

The following code sample shows how to delete chat group shared files:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.removeGroupSharedFile(groupId, fileId)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("remove file success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("remove file fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Retrieve the shared file list

All chat group members can call `fetchGroupFileListFromServer` to retrieve the list of shared files in a chat group from the server.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the list of shared files in a chat group:

```typescript
// Retrieve the shared files with pagination.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.fetchGroupFileListFromServer(groupId, pageSize, pageNum)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("get file success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get file fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Update the chat group extension fields

Only the chat group owner and admins can call `updateGroupExtension` to update the extension fields of a chat group. The extension fields enable users to perform customized operations on a chat group. The maximum length of each extension field is 8 KB, and it must be in the JSON format.

The following code sample shows how to update the chat group extension fields:

```typescript
// Set the extension fields.
const extension = { key: "value" };
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.updateGroupExtension(groupId, JSON.stringify(extension))
  .then(() => {
    console.log("update success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("update fail.", reason);
  });
```
