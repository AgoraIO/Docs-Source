```

### Manage chat group announcements

The chat group owner and chat group admins can set and update chat group announcements. Once the announcements are updated, all chat group members receive the `updateAnnouncement` callback. All chat group members can retrieve chat group announcements.

Refer to the following sample code to manage chat group announcements:

```javascript
// The chat group owner and chat group admins can call updateGroupAnnouncement to set or update the chat group announcements.
// The announcement length can be up to 512 characters.

// All chat group members can call fetchGroupAnnouncement to retrieve the chat group announcements.
const options = {
  groupId: "groupId",
};
chatClient.fetchGroupAnnouncement(options).then((res) => console.log(res));
```

All chat group members can upload or download group shared files. The chat group owner and chat group admins can delete all of the group shared files, whereas group members can only delete the shared files that they have personally uploaded.

Refer to the following sample code to manage chat group shared files:

```javascript
// All chat group members can call uploadGroupSharedFile to upload group shared files. The file size can be up to 10 MB.
// Once shared files are uploaded, group members receive the uploadFile callback.
const options = {
  groupId: "groupId",
  file: file, // <input type="file"/>Choose the file to upload and share.
  onFileUploadProgress: function (resp) {}, // The callback of the upload progress
  onFileUploadComplete: function (resp) {}, // The callback of the upload success
  onFileUploadError: function (e) {}, // The callback of the upload failure
  onFileUploadCanceled: function (e) {}, // The callback of the upload cancelation
};
chatClient.uploadGroupSharedFile(options);

// All chat group members can call downloadGroupSharedFile to delete group shared files.
const options = {
  groupId: "groupId",
  fileId: "fileId", // The ID of the file
  onFileDownloadComplete: function (resp) {}, // The callback of the upload success
  onFileDownloadError: function (e) {}, // The callback of the upload failure
};
chatClient.downloadGroupSharedFile(options);

// All chat group members can call deleteGroupSharedFile to delete group shared files.
const options = {
  groupId: "groupId",
  fileId: "fileId", // The ID of the file
};
chatClient.deleteGroupSharedFile(options).then((res) => console.log(res));

// All chat group members can call getGroupSharedFilelist to retrieve the list of shared files in the chat group.
const options = {
