Content moderation ensures a safe and compliant environment for users by preventing the dissemination of illegal or inappropriate content. In social entertainment and online live streaming scenarios, reviewing video streams published by hosts can identify any illegal content and mitigate compliance risks. This page describes and compares various content moderation solutions offered by Agora. Choose the most appropriate one for your business scenario.

Video moderation can be divided into two main steps: acquiring video data, often in the form of screenshots, and reviewing the video data. Agora provides several methods to acquire video data, each tailored to different needs. Select the appropriate solution based on your business scenario.

## Client-Side Screenshots

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides the `enableContentInspect` method in the native and web SDKs to capture and upload screenshots of video streams in RTC channels. Refer to the [Local screenshot upload](/video-calling/advanced-features/screenshot-upload) page for implementation details.

After uploading client-side screenshots, you can choose to integrate Agora's video moderation functionality provided by its cloud marketplace partners such as [ActiveFence (Beta)](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/?extension=activefence-video-moderation), or select another third-party video moderation service provider of your choice.

## Cloud-based Screenshots

Cloud-based screenshots refer to the use of Agora's cloud recording screenshot function to capture images from video streams within a channel, and uploading the images to a third-party cloud storage. Refer to the following documents for further details:

- [Cloud-based screenshot upload](/cloud-recording/develop/screen-capture)
- [`snapshotConfig`](/cloud-recording/reference/restful-api#snapshotconfig)

Currently, cloud-based screenshots only support integration with third-party service providers for video moderation. Select a third-party service provider and implement the moderation logic yourself.

Pricing for cloud-based screenshots moderation is subject to the billing policies of the third-party moderation service provider.

## Raw Video Data

This solution directly sends raw video data obtained by the Agora Cloud Marketplace video plugin to the cloud marketplace partners for moderation. The moderation results are then sent to the address you specify in the form of HTTP requests. By default, the moderation results are only returned when inappropriate or illegal content is detected.
