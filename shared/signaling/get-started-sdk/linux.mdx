## Implement Signaling

### 1. Create an Agora project

Create a project in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), as follows:

1.  Log in to Console, and click ![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1594283671161) in the left navigation menu to enter the [Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects) page.

2.  Click **Create**.

3.  Enter your project name, and select **APP ID** for the authentication mechanism in the pop-up window.

    Best practice is to use an App ID for authentication only in a test environment, or if your project has low security requirements.

4.  Click **Submit**. You can see the created project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. Get an App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the eye icon to the right of the App ID.

### 3. Integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />

Refer to the following steps to integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> into the sample project:

1.  Download the [RTM](https://github.com/AgoraIO/RTM) repository on Github, and locate the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Linux-Server` folder.

2.  Download the latest version of [Real time Messaging SDK (Linux C++)](../reference/downloads.html) and extract the files.

3.  Copy the `*.so` file in the SDK folder into the `lib` directory of the project folder, and copy the `*.h` file in the SDK folder into the `include` directory of the project folder.

### 4. Run the sample project

Refer to the following steps to run the sample project:

1.  Go to the project directory, and run the following command to build the project:

    ``` shell
    $ ./build.sh build
    ```

2.  Run the following command to run the project. Replace &lt;Your App ID&gt; with your App ID.

    ``` shell
    $ ./build/rtmServerDemo <Your App ID>
    ```
