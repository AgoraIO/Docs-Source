The <Vg k="RTEE_CLARITY" /> extension leverages Agora's AI quality enhancement algorithm, which intelligently improves video quality without altering the resolution, thereby optimizing the viewing experience at the receiving end. The AI enhancement algorithm supports over 95% of mobile devices and ensures high-quality video rendering on low-end devices.

## Understand the tech
 
The media transmission pipeline of the Agora Web SDK consists of capture, pre-processing, encoding, transmission, decoding, post-processing, and playback stages. The <Vg k="RTEE_CLARITY" /> extension processes video data in the post-processing stage to apply the AI enhancement effect.
