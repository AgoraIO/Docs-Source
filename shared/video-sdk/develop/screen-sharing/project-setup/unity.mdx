### iOS platform

You use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then add the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the channel as a user. Since Apple does not support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream.

### macOS and Windows platforms

Windows or macOS systems assign a unique **Display ID** to each screen and a unique **Window ID** to each window. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> currently supports the following two <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> options on the macOS, Windows platforms:

    - Share a specific screen or part of a specified screen: Call `GetScreenCaptureSources` to get the **Display ID** and then call `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
    - Share a specific window or part of a specified window: Call `GetScreenCaptureSources` to get the **Window ID** and then call `StartScreenCaptureByWindowId` to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
