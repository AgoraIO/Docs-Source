<PlatformWrapper platform="[android, ios, macos, linux-cpp, web]">
<Vpd k="NAME" /> enables you to send direct, point-to-point messages to individual users through user channels. This feature is useful in one-on-one communication scenarios such as private chats and customer support interactions.

## Understand the tech

To implement point-to-point communication between individual users in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>:

1. **Set up the <Vpd k="SDK" />**: [Integrate the <Vpd k="SDK" />](../get-started/sdk-quickstart#integrate-the-sdk) in your app and [initialize an instance](../get-started/sdk-quickstart#initialize-the-signaling-engine) of the <Vpd k="NAME" /> client.
2. **Authenticate the user**: [Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />](../get-started/sdk-quickstart#log-in-to-signaling) using a unique user ID.
3. **Send direct messages**: Call the `publish` method with the User channel type and specify the recipient's user ID as the channel name to send direct messages.
4. **Handle incoming messages**: [Listen for message events](../get-started/sdk-quickstart#add-an-event-listener) to receive messages sent directly to the local user.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

* Integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project, and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart).

## Implement user messages

This section shows you how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to send messages directly to a specified user.

<Admonition type="info">
<Vg k="SIG" /> currently supports only string and binary message formats. To send other types of data such as a JSON objects, or data from third-party data construction tools such as protobuf, serialize the data before sending the message. For information on how to effectively construct the payload data structure and recommended serialization methods, refer to [Message payload structuring](../best-practices/message-payload-structuring).
