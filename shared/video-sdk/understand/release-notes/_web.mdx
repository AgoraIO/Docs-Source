{props.PRODUCT}

## Overview

{data.VSDK} 4.x is a JavaScript and TypeScript library loaded by an HTML web page. The SDK library uses APIs in the web browser to establish connections and control the communication and interactive live streaming services.

### Compatibility

See <Link to={`/${props.PATH}/reference/supported-platforms/`} replace>Supported platforms.</Link>

### Known issues

_Chrome deprecates and removes the Plan B dialect_

Chrome plans to deprecate and remove the Plan B dialect in WebRTC. For details, see the [Chrome feature description](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5823036655665152). This change affects the following Agora {data.VSDK} versions:


|{data.VSDK} version |Impact|
|---|---|
|v2.5.0-2.9.0 <br /> v3.0.0-3.6.1 | After a stream is published, the method call of `switchDevice` causes video freezes or no sound issues.|
|v4.0.0-4.0.1 |The `publish` and `subscribe` methods do not take effect.|

If you use any of the above SDK versions, Agora recommends that you upgrade the SDK to the latest version.

## v4.11.0

v4.11.0 was released on April 1, 2022.

### Compatibility changes

As of v4.11.0, the SDK adopts an automatic mode by default to ensure connectivity. In this mode, the SDK first attempts a direct connection to Agora SD-RTN™; if the attempt fails, the SDK automatically switches to TCP/TLS 443. You can listen for such auto-switch events through `client.on('join-fallback-to-proxy')`.

### Improvements

_Channel capacity improvement_

As of v4.11.0, a single channel can support up to 128 concurrent online hosts, who can publish audio and video streams at the same time. The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To experience this improvement, contact support@agora.io

### Fixed issues

v4.11.0 fixed the following issues:

- Angular's dependency zone.js caused an error when `Promise.finally` was called in the SDK.
- On Chrome, AEC could not be enabled when sending stereo sound.
- On Chrome 100, the SDK reported inaccurate statistics for the decoding frame rate and sending frame rate.
- When dual-stream mode was enabled, calling `unpublish` without parameters caused the method call to fail.

## v4.10.2

v4.10.2 was released on March 24, 2022. This release fixed the issue that calling `join` in certain scenarios might cause proxy exceptions.

## v4.10.1

v4.10.1 was released on March 17, 2022 and added the dependency of TypeScript type definitions for Agora Extension `agora-rte-extension` in `package.json`. If you use TypeScript for type checking, Agora suggests that you update TypeScript to v4.3.2 or later.

## v4.10.0

v4.10.0 was released on March 11, 2022.

### New features

_Adding support for media processing extensions_

v4.10.0 supports using media processing extensions in the {data.VSDK}. The following extensions are currently free to use during the beta period. For guidance on how to integrate and use the extensions, refer to the documentation listed in the following table:

IAIN: sort out these links when https://gitlab.com/agora-documentation/documentation-source/-/issues/239 is done.


|Extension | Description | Documentation|
|---|---|---| 
|Virtual Background Extension (Beta) |Enables users to replace their actual background with a solid color or custom image, or to blur their background. |[Use the Virtual Background Extension](/virtual_background_web_ng?platform=Web)|
|AI Denoiser Extension (Beta) |Reduces many types of sudden noise and reduces vocal distortion when multiple people speak at the same time.|[Use the AI Denoiser Extension](/noise_reduction_web_ng?platform=Web)|

### API changes

_Added_

- `AgoraRTC.registerExtensions`
- `LocalTrack.pipe`
- `LocalTrack.unpipe`
- `LocalTrack.processorDestination`

## v4.9.4

v4.9.4 was released on March 16, 2022 and fixed the failure to access localStorage when loading the SDK in an iFrame in Chrome Incognito mode.

## v4.9.3

v4.9.3 was released on March 3, 2022. This release fixed several internal issues.

## v4.9.1

v4.9.1 was released on February 24, 2022. This release fixed several internal issues.

## v4.9.0

v4.9.0 was released on February 17, 2022.

### New features

_Setting the video stream type of all remote users_

v4.9.0 adds the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method. After you call `enableDualStream` to enable dual-stream mode on the senders' clients, `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` enables receivers to choose whether to receive the high-quality or low-quality stream of all remote users.

_Cloud Proxy Force TCP mode_

v4.9.0 adds Force TCP mode for the Agora Cloud Proxy service. In this mode, the SDK always transmits data over TLS 443. To use this mode, set `mode` as 5 when calling `startProxyServer`.

### Improvements

- Improves the accuracy of the `client.on('is-using-cloud-proxy')` event.
- If you set the video resolution but do not set the bitrate, the SDK now can automatically calculate and set a reasonable bitrate according to the resolution and frame rate. This improvement helps to avoid bandwidth overload due to a high bitrate.

### Issues fixed

v4.9.0 fixed the following issues:

- When you call `play` to play a local video track and pass in a DOM element from another window, the SDK reported an error.
- When using v4.8.0 together with Angular and zone.js, users might fail to join a channel because zone.js modified the promise object.
- Several known issues on iOS.

### API changes

_Added_

- `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType`
- `client.on('join-fallback-to-proxy')`

## v4.8.2

v4.8.2 was released on January 27, 2022. This release fixed the issue that on iOS WeChat, the video playback might go black after being interrupted by a screen lock.

## v4.8.1

v4.8.1 was released on January 6, 2022. This release fixed an internal issue.

## v4.8.0

v4.8.0 was released on December 29, 2021.

### New features

_Checking the visibility of the `<video>` HTML tag_

After you call `play`, the SDK creates an `<video>` HTML tag for playing video tracks. v4.8.0 adds the following methods and events for checking the visibility of the `<video>` tag:

- `localVideoTrack.on('video-element-visible-status')`
- `remoteVideoTrack.on('video-element-visible-status')`
- `localVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`
- `remoteVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`

When `localTrack.isPlaying` or `remoteTrack.isPlaying` is `true` but you cannot see any video, the above methods or events can help you check whether the `<video>` tag is visible or not and learn the reason when the `<video>` tag is invisible.

### Improvements

v4.8.0 made some internal improvements.

### Issues fixed

v4.8.0 fixed the following issues:

- When receiving streams on iOS Safari as an audience member, the host’s voice could be heard, but the volume returned by the `client.on('volume-indicator')` event was 0.
- When sending streams on iOS Safari, if you first call `setDevice` and then `setEncoderConfiguration`, the SDK returns an error.

### API changes

_Added_

- `localVideoTrack.on('video-element-visible-status')`
- `remoteVideoTrack.on('video-element-visible-status')`
- `localVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`
- `remoteVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`

## v4.7.3

v4.7.3 was released on November 17, 2021. This release avoided the issue that on the Safari browser in iOS 15.1, after an audio or video call was interrupted, the {data.VSDK} failed to resume playing the remote media.

## v4.7.2

v4.7.2 was released on October 14, 2021, with the following changes:

- Avoided the [issue](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230537) that on the Safari browser in iOS 15, after an audio or video call was interrupted by a phone call, the {data.VSDK} might fail to resume sending the local media and playing the remote media.
- Avoided the [black screen issue](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230532) that might occur when using `videoTrack.play(element, {mirror: true})` to play the video on the desktop or mobile Safari 15 browser.
- Fixed the issue that calling `AgoraRTC.checkSystemRequirements()` on the Edge browser only returned `false`.

## v4.7.1

v4.7.1 was released on September 13, 2021. This release fixed some issues on Safari 11 and iPad Chrome.

## v4.7.0

v4.7.0 was released on September 1, 2021.

### Compatibility changes

As of v4.7.0, if you enable media stream encryption, the SDK automatically disables encryption and resets the encryption configurations after a user leaves the channel. To re-enable the encryption, call `setEncryptionConfig` before the user joins the channel again.

### Improvements

This release makes the following improvements:

- Optimizes the end-user experience of the {data.VSDK} on the mobile browser.
- Improves the accuracy of the volume obtained by `getVolumeLevel`.
- Adds the support of enabling dual-stream mode on Safari.

### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- After calling `LocalAudioTrack.setVolume` to adjust the local volume, the local user could not perceive the volume change.
- When the log level was set to none, the SDK nevertheless output the initialization logs.
- The promise returned by `LocalAudioTrack.setDevice` could get stuck in a pending state.

## v4.6.3

v4.6.3 was released on August 10, 2021. This release fixed an occasional issue: After the user closes a tab or browser on the local client, the remote client does not receive the `user-left` event immediately.

## v4.6.2

v4.6.2 was released on July 30, 2021. This release fixed the issue that the SDK did not destroy all the media players created during a call or live streaming. Chrome 92 introduced a limit on the number of media players that can be created in a particular tab: 75 for the desktop. After you play tracks several times, the undestroyed media players in the SDK might cause the playback failure in the tab.

## v4.6.1

v4.6.1 was released on July 21, 2021. This release fixed an internal error.

## v4.6.0

v4.6.0 was released on July 16, 2021.

### New features

_Interactive Live Streaming Standard_

As of v4.6.0, the {data.VSDK} supports Interactive Live Streaming Standard. The major difference between Agora Interactive Live Streaming Standard and Agora Live Interactive Streaming Premium is the latency level on the audience's client:

- Interactive Live Streaming Premium: Ultra-low latency (400 ms to 800 ms) from the host's client to an audience member's client.
- Interactive Live Streaming Standard: Low latency (1500 ms to 2000 ms) from the host's client to an audience member's client.

The charges for Standard and Premium are different. For details, see the [product overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/live-streaming/product_live_standard) and [pricing](https://docs.agora.io/en/live-streaming/billing_live_standard?platform=Android) of Interactive Live Streaming Standard.

You can set the latency level of the audience role in the following two ways:

- When calling `createClient` to create a client object, set the `role` parameter as `'audience'` and the `level` parameter in `clientRoleOptions` as `1`.
- When calling the `setClientRole` method, set the `role` parameter as `'audience'` and the level parameter in `clientRoleOptions` as `1`.

_The mute states of local tracks_

v4.6.0 adds the `localTrack.setMuted` method to stop sending the media data of local tracks. The differences between this method and `localTrack.setEnabled` are as follows:

- After the method call of `localVideoTrack.setEnabled(false)` to stop sending video, the SDK also immediately turns off the camera light and stops video capture, while `localVideoTrack.setMuted` does not stop video capture.
- Calling `setEnabled(true)` takes longer to resume sending the media data than by than calling `setMuted(false)`.

For more information, see [What are the differences between setEnabled and setMuted?](https://docs.agora.io/en/live-streaming/faq/differences_between_setenabled_and_setmuted)

### Improvements

_Dealing with autoplay blocking_

To deal with the autoplay blocking of video on iOS, v4.6.0 deprecates the `onAudioAutoplayFailed` callback, and adds the `onAutoplayFailed` callback instead to indicate an audio or video autoplay failure.

On most web browsers, inaudible media are not affected by autoplay blocking. However, on iOS Safari with low power mode enabled, or on other iOS in-app browsers that implement a custom autoplay policy, such as the WeChat browser, the autoplay of inaudible media is blocked.

### Issues fixed

v4.6.0 fixes the following issues:

- The method call of `localAudioTrack.setVolume` did not take effect immediately.
- Using multiple clients on one web page caused unexpected issues.
- The SDK did not check whether the App ID was a string of 1 to 256 bytes in size.

### API changes

_Added_

- `localTrack.setMuted`
- `onAutoplayFailed`
- `clientRoleOptions` in `ClientConfig`
- `options` in the `setClientRole` method

_Deprecated_

- `onAudioAutoplayFailed`

## v4.5.0

v4.5.0 was released on May 25, 2021.

### New features

_AEC (Acoustic Echo Canceller) for the audio played on the local client_

In a scenario where multiple users play a media file at the same time, such as watching a movie together, if the user A plays the media file through [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) on Chrome with a speaker, the SDK captures the audio played by a speaker together with the voice of the user A. The other users can hear the audio sent by the user A and the audio played locally, which sounds like an echo. To deal with this echo issue, v4.5.0 adds the `processExternalMediaAEC` method. You can call `processExternalMediaAEC` and pass in the `HTMLMediaElement` to enable the AEC for the audio played on the local client.

### Improvements

_Channel encryption_

To strengthen the security of the key, v4.5.0 adds two encryption modes, `'aes-128-gcm2'` and `'aes-256-gcm2'`, which use the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). When calling `setEncryptionConfig` and setting the encryption mode as `'aes-128-gcm2'` or `'aes-256-gcm2'`, you need to set `secret` and `salt`. For how to generate and set `secret` and `salt`, see link:./channel_encryption_web_ng[Media Stream Encryption].

_Network geofencing_

As of v4.5.0, when calling setArea to specify the region for connection, you can use the `areaCode` parameter to specify a large region and use the `excludedArea` parameter to specify a small region. The region for connection is the large region excluding the small region. You can only specify the large region as `'GLOBAL'`. For details, see link:./region_web_ng_rtc[Network Geofencing].

_The preset video encoder configurations for screen sharing_

v4.5.0 adds the following preset video encoder configurations for screen sharing in ScreenEncoderConfigurationPreset:

- `'480p_3'`: The resolution is 640 × 480 and the frame rate is 15 fps.
- `'720p_3'`: The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 15 fps.
- `'1080p_3`': The resolution is 1920 × 1080 and the frame rate is 15 fps.

### Issues fixed

v4.5.0 fixes the following issues:

- The `OptimizationMode` setting did not take effect.
- On iOS, when the {data.VSDK} captures media, noises might occur on the local client.
- On Firefox, after the stream transmitted by the SDK switched from high quality to low quality, the video resolution obtained by the `getRemoteVideoStats` method was still the resolution of the high-quality stream.
- On Chrome, after you called `remoteAudioTrack.setVolume` to adjust the volume, if the playback was paused and then resumed, the volume changed back to the original one.
- On Chrome, the `LocalAudioTrack.setVolume` method did not take effect.

### API changes

_Added_

- `processExternalMediaAEC`
- `clientRoleOptions` in `ClientConfig`
- `options` in the `setClientRole` method
- `salt` in the `setEncryptionConfig` method
- `'aes-128-gcm'` and `'aes-256-gcm'` in `EncryptionMode`
- `excludedArea` in the `setArea` method

## v4.4.0

v4.4.0 was released on April 2, 2021.

### Compatibility changes

_Firewall domain whitelist_

As of v4.4.0, the destination domains required for your firewall whitelist changes to:

```
.agora.io
.edge.agora.io
.sd-rtn.com
.edge.sd-rtn.com
```

If you upgrade the SDK to v4.4.0, update your firewall domain whitelist to ensure you can use Agora products in environments with restricted network access.

### Improvements

_AES-GCM encryption mode_

In scenarios requiring high security, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data, and to improve the computational efficiency of data encryption, v4.4.0 adds the following encryption modes in `EncryptionMode`:

- `'aes-128-xts'`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
- `'aes-256-gcm'`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users, such as the Agora recording service.

_Cloud proxy_

v4.4.0 adds the `client.on('is-using-cloud-proxy')` event. The SDK triggers this event after the local client successfully publishes a media stream to indicate whether the media stream is forwarded by the [cloud proxy service](/cloud_proxy_web_ng?platform=Web).

_Error code_

If you start media capturing after disabling the media capture device on Windows, the error thrown by the SDK changes from `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` to `NOT_READABLE`.

### Issues fixed

v4.4.0 fixes the following issues:

- The SDK did not trigger the `'first-frame-decoded'` event for a remote audio track.
- The return value of `AgoraRTC.checkSystemRequirement` was inaccurate.
- When the network had multiple IP addresses, the cloud proxy service did not take effect.

### API changes

_Added_

- `client.on('is-using-cloud-proxy')`
- `'aes-128-gcm'` and `'aes-256-gcm'` in `EncryptionMode`

## v4.3.0

v4.3.0 was released on January 26, 2021.

### New features

_Cloud proxy_

This release optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture and enhances the connectivity of the {data.VSDK} in environments with restricted network access. The optimized Agora cloud proxy service also supports regional connection.

You can contact support@agora.io to apply for using the optimized Agora cloud proxy service and set the `mode` parameter as `3` when calling `startProxyServer`. For details, see link:./cloud_proxy_web_ng[Use Cloud Proxy].

## v4.2.1

v4.2.1 was released on December 23, 2020. This release fixed the incorrect error that the SDK throws when you pass an illegal parameter in the client.publish method.

## v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on December 1, 2020.

### New features

_Regional connection_

This release adds the `AgoraRTC.setArea` method for specifying the region for connection. After specifying the region, the SDK connects to the Agora servers within that region. The following regions are supported:

- China
- North America
- Europe
- Asia, excluding Mainland China
- Japan
- India
- Global

This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions.

_Video transmission optimization strategy_

This release adds the `localVideoTrack.setOptimizationMode` method for setting the video transmission optimization mode:

- `'balanced'`: Uses the default transmission optimization strategy.
- `'detail'`: Prioritizes clarity.
- `'motion'`: Prioritizes smoothness.

See the API reference for the introduction to each transmission optimization mode. This method applies to scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust the optimization mode during a video call, live streaming, or screen sharing. For example, during the screen sharing, before you change the shared content from slides to a video, you can change the optimization mode from `'detail'` to `'motion'` to ensure smoothness in poor network conditions.

_Network quality of remote users_

This release adds the `AgoraRTCClient.getRemoteNetworkQuality` method for getting the uplink and downlink network quality of all the remote users to whom the local user subscribes.

_Cloud proxy_

This release changes the `mode` parameter of the `AgoraRTCClient.startProxyServer` method from `boolean` to `number`.

### Improvements

- After disabling an audio or video tracks by calling `setEnabled`, you can still call `setDevice` to switch devices.
- After you call `AgoraRTCClient.setEncryptionConfig` to enable the built-in encryption, when the user uses a weak secret, the SDK outputs a warning message to the Web Console and prompts the user to use a strong secret. A strong secret must contain at least eight characters and be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Fixed issues

- When you disabled a local video track, you could not publish another video track.
- After enabling dual-stream mode, if you called `setEnabled(false)` to disable a video track during the process of publishing, the publishing failed and could not be recovered.
- After an audience member tried to publish a local track in live mode but failed, the audience member could not publish this track even after switching the role to host.
- After dual-stream mode was enabled, a bug during the disconnection would occasionally cause publishing to fail after reconnection.
- After unpublishing a local camera video track and then publishing a screen-sharing track, the video bitrate was fixed at around 700 Kbps, and the resolution and frame rate dropped.
- Due to Safari's limited support for WebAudio, the audio of `BufferSourceAudioTrack` could be distorted.
- When the SDK gained device permission for the first time, it did not trigger the media device change events (`onMicrophoneChanged`, `onCameraChanged`, or `onPlaybackDeviceChanged`). The SDK only triggered these events for a subsequent device change.

### API changes

_Added_

- `AgoraRTC.setArea`
- `localVideoTrack.setOptimizationMode`
- `AgoraRTCClient.getRemoteNetworkQuality`

_Changed_

- Changed the type of the `mode` parameter in `AgoraRTCClient.startProxyServer` from `boolean` to `number`

## v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on October 27, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Improved the accuracy of the `event_network_quality` event.
- The method call of `createCameraVideoTrack` did not stop on Safari when the SDK cannot find a video capture device.
- After calling `unsubscribe` to unsubscribing from an unpublished track of a remote user, the subsequent subscribing and unsubscribing operations failed to take effect.
- Reduced the performance degradation due to frequent method calls of `setEnabled` to enable and disable a video track in dual-stream mode.
- Occasional errors when `client.getLocalVideoStats` was called on Safari.

## v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on September 4, 2020.

### New features

_Screenshot capture_

v4.1.0 adds the `getCurrentFrameData` method which gets the data of the video frame being rendered.

_Audio playback device management_

v4.1.0 adds the following APIs to manage audio playback devices:

- `setPlaybackDevice`: Sets the audio playback device, for example, the speaker. This method supports Chrome only.
- `getPlaybackDevices`: Retrieves the audio playback devices available.
- `onPlaybackDeviceChanged`: Occurs when an audio playback device is added or removed.

### Improvements

- Fully supports Chromium-based versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 80 and later).
- Improves the accuracy of the `network-quality` event.
- Supports sharing audio when sharing Chrome tabs on macOS.

### Fixed issues

- Information retrieved by `checkVideoTrackIsActive` on Safari is inaccurate.
- Occasional failure of reconnection after enabling dual-stream mode.
- Occasional failure to call `setEnabled` after leaving the channel.
- Failure to push streams to CDN with transcoding and without transcoding at the same time.
- Occasional failure to automatically re-subscribe to the remote streams after disconnection, indicated by the `UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE: ERR_SUBSCRIBE_REQUEST_INVALID` error.
- Failure to join different channels with the same UID in one browser tab.
- Occasional misreport on connection states due to frequent channel join and leave.

### API changes

_Added_

- `LocalVideoTrack.getCurrentFrameData`
- `RemoteVideoTrack.getCurrentFrameData`
- `AgoraRTC.getPlaybackDevices`
- `LocalAudioTrack.setPlaybackDevice`
- `RemoteAudioTrack.setPlaybackDevice`
- `AgoraRTC.onPlaybackDeviceChanged`
- `Client.getLocalAudioStats`
- `Client.getRemoteAudioStats`
- `Client.getLocalVideoStats`
- `Client.getRemoteVideoStats`

_Deprecated_

- The `LocalTrack.getStats` and `RemoteTrack.getStats` methods. Use the `Client.getLocalAudioStats`, `Client.getRemoteAudioStats`, `Client.getLocalVideoStats` and `Client.getRemoteVideoStats` methods instead.

## v4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on July 18, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- Failure to publish local tracks on Chrome 70.
- Publish operation may not be aborted when leaving the channel.

## v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on July 15, 2020.

### Compatibility changes

v4.0.0 deletes the `LocalTrack.setMute` method and adds the `LocalTrack.setEnabled` method for enabling or disabling a local track. The advantages of this change are as follows:

- Eliminates the concept of "mute" to avoid confusion between mute states and publishing states.
- In versions earlier than v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the `Client.on('user-mute-updated')` callback when the remote user calls `setMute` to change the mute state.
- As of v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the existing `Client.on('user-unpublished')` or `Client.on('user-published')` callbacks when the remote user calls `setEnabled` to enable or disable a track.
- After you call `setMute(true)`, the SDK sends black video frames or silenced audio frames. If you mute a local video track, the camera light stays on, which might adversely impact the user experience. In contrast, if you disable a local video track by calling `setEnabled(false)`, the SDK immediately turns off the camera and stops capturing video.

> The `setEnabled` method changes media input behaviors, so it is an asynchronous operation and returns the result through the `Promise` object.

### New features

_Video encoding strategy_

v4.0.0 adds the `optimizationMode` property in the `CameraVideoTrackInitConfig`, `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig`, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` interfaces. When creating a video track by calling `createCameraVideoTrack`, `createCustomVideoTrack`, or `createScreenVideoTrack`, you can choose whether to prioritize video quality or smoothness by setting optimizationMode as the following:

- `'detail'`: Prioritizes video quality.
- The SDK ensures high-quality images by automatically calculating a minimum bitrate based on the capturing resolution and frame rate. No matter how poor the network condition is, the sending bitrate will never be lower than the minimum value.
- In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the sending resolution, but may reduce the frame rate.
- `'motion'`: Prioritizes video smoothness.
- In poor network conditions, the SDK reduces the sending bitrate to minimize video freezes.
- In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the frame rate, but may reduce the sending resolution.

---

The `optimizationMode` property of the video track created by calling createScreenVideoTrack is set as `'detail'` by default.

---

### Improvements

- Redesigns the `withAudio` parameter in `AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack`. In addition to `enable` and `disable`, you can also set `withAudio` as `auto`. In this setting, the SDK shares the audio, dependent on whether the browser supports this function.
- Does not allow setting the `withAudio` parameter as `'all'` any more to avoid code repetition. As of v4.0.0, you can only set `withAudio` as `'audio'` or `'video'`. This change involves the following APIs:
- The `Client.subscribe` method.
- The `Client.on('user-published')` and `Client.on('user-unpublished')` callbacks.

### Fixed issues

v4.0.0 fixed the following issues:

- After the local user called `unpublish`, the SDK triggerred the `Client.on('user-left')` callback on the remote side.
- Periodic video blur when sharing the screen in `'rtc'` mode.
- Occasional publishing failure when calling `publish` and `unpublish` frequently.
- The `Client.on('network-quality')` callback was inaccurate.

### API changes

_Added_

- The `Client.localTracks` interface
- The `LocalTrack.setEnabled` method
- The `optimizationMode` property in ` CameraVideoTrackInitConfig, ``ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig `, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` interfaces

_Updated_

- Adds the value of `auto` to the withAudio parameter in `AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack`.
- Removes the value of `'all'` from the mediaType parameter in `Client.subscribe`.
- The `mediaType` parameter in the `Client.on('user-published')` and `Client.on('user-unpublished')` callbacks does report `'all'`

_Deprecated_

- The `LocalAudioTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `LocalVideoTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `RemoteAudioTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `RemoteVideoTrackStats.muteState` property

_Deleted_

- The `Client.on('user-mute-updated')` callback
- The `LocalTrack.setMute` method
- The `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.audioMuted` property
- The `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.videoMuted` property
- The `LocalTrack.getUserId` method
