![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

The source code of <Vg k="FC"/> contains the following packages:

- `agora-demo-app`: The <Vg k="ACS"/> demo app, supports Web, H5, Electron and other platforms, supports online classroom, online invigilation function, and provides code samples for online classroom before, during, and after class.

- `agora-plugin-gallery`: An independent plug-in library for <Vg k="ACS"/>, which inherits the `AgoraWidgetBase` class and implements the `AgoraWidgetLifecycle` interface. It includes plug-ins such as interactive whiteboard, IM chat, answering machine, voting machine, and timer.

- `fcr-ui-scene/`: General education scene SDK
    - `/src/uistores`: UI Store directory. UI Store is responsible for providing business logic encapsulation for UI components.
    - `/src/containers`: UI functional components combined with UI Store to become UI business components.
    - `/src/scenarios`: UI scene. Scenarios are composed of multiple business components.
    - `/src/extension`: API package for communicating with Widget
    - `/src/resources`: Static resource files such as pictures and sounds
    - `/src/utils`: Common UI components

- `fcr-ui-kit/`: Common scene UI component library
    - `/src/components`: Common UI components
    - `/src/utils`: General hooks tool class

- `agora-common-libs`: General tool class library, including ThemeProvider, I18nProvider, and other global general tools

- `agora-edu-core`: Provides upstream API calls and downstream data structure encapsulation for education and proctoring scenarios in smart classrooms.

- `agora-rte-sdk`: Provides cross-end RTC adaptation capabilities as well as classroom event callbacks and data structure encapsulation.

## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate Cloud Classroom into your web project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole Cloud Classroom through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-classroom-sdk) or CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Cloud Classroom, you need to integrate by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop) on GitHub.

### Use the default UI

If you are satisfied with the default UI of Cloud Classroom and do not want to change any of it, integrate through npm or CDN.

#### Through npm

1. To install the SDK, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install fcr-ui-scene agora-plugin-gallery
    ```

2. Import modules and plug-ins into the project's JavaScript code:

    ```
    import { FcrUIScene } from 'fcr-ui-scene'
    import {
      FcrChatroom,
      FcrBoardWidget,
      FcrPollingWidget,
      FcrStreamMediaPlayerWidget,
      FcrWebviewWidget,
      FcrCountdownWidget,
      FcrPopupQuizWidget
    } from 'agora-plugin-gallery/scene'
    ```

3. To launch a classroom, call [FcrUIScene.launch](../../client-api/ui-scene#launch).

#### Through CDN

1. Add the following code to the HTML file in your project:

    ```html
    <!-- <!-- Please replace X.Y.Z with the cloud classroom version number, such as 1.0.10.
    You can check the latest version number through the release notes or GitHub repository branch. -->
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/fcr-ui-scene_sdk@X.Y.Z.bundle.js"></script>
    ```

2. To launch a classroom, call [FcrUIScene.launch](../../client-api/ui-scene#launch).

#### Sample code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!-- Introduce SDK, 1.0.10 is the sample version number. You can check the latest version number through the release notes or GitHub repository branch. -->
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/fcr-ui-scene_sdk@1.0.10.bundle.js"></script>
    <!-- Introduce Widget, 1.0.10 is the sample version number. You can check the latest version number through the release notes or GitHub warehouse branch -->
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/scene_widget@1.0.10.bundle.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <style>
      #root {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Start cloud classroom
      FcrUIScene.launch(document.querySelector("#root"), {
        appId: "Your App ID",
        region: "NA",
        userUuid: "user id",
        userName: "user name",
        roomUuid: "room id",
        roomType: 4, // Room type: 4 is for small classes, currently only small classes are supported.
        roomName: "room name",
        pretest: true, // Whether to enable pre-class equipment detection
        token: "rtm token", // In a test environment, you can use temporary RTM Token; in a production or security environment, it is strongly recommended that you use a server-generated RTM Token.
        language: "zh",
        duration: 60 * 30, // Course time in seconds.
        recordUrl: "your record url",
        userRole: 1, // User roles: 1 is teacher, 2 is student
        widgets: {
          easemobIM: FcrChatroom, // IM widget
          netlessBoard: FcrBoardWidget, // Interactive whiteboard widget
          poll: FcrPollingWidget, // Voter widget
          mediaPlayer: FcrStreamMediaPlayerWidget, // Video sync player widget
          webView: FcrWebviewWidget, // Embedded browser widget
          countdownTimer: FcrCountdownWidget, // Countdown widget
          popupQuiz: FcrPopupQuizWidget, // Clicker widget
        },
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what a <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purposes, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server. The generated token passed in `userId` must be consistent with the `userUuid` parameters passed in the `launch` method; otherwise, the generated token will be invalid.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Cloud Classroom, you need to integrate  by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:
