## Set up the environment

Set up the environment on your Linux server:

1. [Download](http://docs.agora.io/en/sdks) the Agora On-Premise Recording SDK for Linux package. The package structure is listed as follows:

  | Folder | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `bin` | The directory where AgoraCoreService is located. |
  | `include` | <li>`base`: Required header files for developing the recording application.</li><li>`IAgoraLinuxSdkCommon.h`: Public structure and enumeration.</li><li>`IAgoraRecordingEngine.h`: Interface of the recording engine and its configuration.</li> |
  | `libs` | Required libraries for developing the recording application. |
  | `samples` | Sample code: <ul><li>`agorasdk`: Demo that implements the C++ interface and callbacks.</li><li>`base`: Public sample code.</li><li>`cpp`: C++ sample code.<ul><li>`release/bin/recorder`: Parent process that can be run.</li></ul></li><li>java: Java sample code.<ul><li>`native`: Native code.</li><li>`native/jni`: JNI delegate.</li><li>`src`: Java code.</li><li>`src/io/agora/recording/RecordingEventHandler.java`: Callback interface class.</li><li>`src/io/agora/recording/RecordingSDK.java`: Recording interface class.</li></ul></li></ul> |
  | `tools` | Transcoding tools. |

2. Prepare the required libraries:
      - Add the `include` folder to your project.
      - Add the `libs` folder to your project and make sure the `librecorder.a` file is connected to the project.
3. Ensure that your compiler is GCC 4.4+.
4. If your firewall restricts access to the Agora services, use [cloud proxy service](../develop/cloud-proxy).

5. Open the UDP ports used by the recording processes. The UDP ports are the ports between the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters specified in  `RecordingConfig`.

    <Admonition type="info">
    - Use the `iptables -L` command to check the UDP port.
    - To record the content in the channels, you need one recording process for each channel. A single recording process requires four UDP ports. There must be no port conflict among the processes, including the system processes and all recording processes.
    - Best practice is to specify the range of ports used by the recording processes. Configure a large range for all recording processes \(Agora recommends 40000 to 41000 or larger\). The <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> assigns ports to each recording process within the specified range and avoids port conflicts automatically. To set the port range, configure the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters.
    - If the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters are not specified, random ports are used by the recording processes that may cause port conflicts.

6. For debugging purposes, enable core dump on your Linux system.
