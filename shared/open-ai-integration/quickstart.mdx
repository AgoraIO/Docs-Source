Integrating Agora's real-time audio communication capabilities with OpenAI's language models enables dynamic, conversational AI experiences. This guide shows you how to set up a Python project that combines Agora's server-side Voice SDK with OpenAI's API to create an interactive, voice-driven assistant.

## Understand the tech

The `RealtimeKitAgent` class manages the integration by connecting to an Agora channel for real-time audio streaming and to OpenAI's API for processing audio input and generating AI-driven responses. Audio frames captured from the Agora channel are streamed to OpenAI's API, where the AI processes the input. The API responses, which include transcribed text and synthesized voice output, are then delivered back to the Agora channel.

The code sets up tools that can be executed locally or passed through the API, allowing the AI to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving data from external sources. The agent processes various message types from OpenAI, including audio responses, transcription updates, and error messages, and sends them to users through the Agora audio channel, facilitating continuous interaction.

The following figure illustrates the integration topology:

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

- FFmpeg

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```

## Getting Started

This guide walks you through the core elements of the [Agora Conversational AI Demo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/openai-realtime-python) integrating Agora's Python SDK with OpenAI's Realtime API.

If you’d prefer to skip the step-by-step guide and explore the demo project, clone the [repository](https://github.com/AgoraIO/openai-realtime-python) and follow the steps in the README to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/openai-realtime-python.git
cd agora-openai-converse
```

## Set up the project

To follow the step-by-step procedure:

1. Create a new folder for the project:

    ```
    mkdir realtime_agent
    cd realtime_agent/
    ```

1. Create the base project structure:

    ```
    mkdir -p realtimeapi && touch {__init__.py,.env,agent.py,logger.py,main.py,parse_args.py,tools.py,utils.py,requirements.txt,realtimeapi/connection.py,realtimeapi/struct.py}
    ```

    The project structure should look like this:

    ```
    /realtime_agent
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── .env
        ├── agent.py

### RealtimeKitAgent

The `RealtimeKitAgent` class integrates Agora's real-time audio communication with OpenAI’s AI services. It handles streaming, communication with the OpenAI API, and AI responses, creating a seamless conversational experience.

### Connect to Agora and OpenAI

The `setup_and_run_agent` method connects to an Agora channel using `RtcEngine`, and sets up a session with OpenAI’s Realtime API. It configures the session parameters, such as system messages and voice settings, and uses asynchronous tasks to concurrently listen for the session to start and update the conversation configuration. In the base `agent.py` file, replace the placeholder with the following implementation.

```python
    @classmethod
    async def setup_and_run_agent(
        cls,
        *,
        engine: RtcEngine,
        options: RtcOptions,
        inference_config: InferenceConfig,
        tools: ToolContext | None,
    ) -> None:
        channel = engine.create_channel(options)
        await channel.connect()

        try:
            async with RealtimeApiClient(
                base_uri="wss://api.openai.com",
                api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
                verbose=False,
            ) as client:
                await client.send_message(
                    messages.SessionUpdate(
                        session=messages.SessionUpdateParams(
                            turn_detection=inference_config.turn_detection,
                            tools=tools.model_description() if tools else [],
                            tool_choice="auto",
                            input_audio_format="pcm16",
                            output_audio_format="pcm16",
                            instructions=inference_config.system_message,
                            voice=inference_config.voice,
                            model=os.environ.get("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01"),
                            modalities=["text", "audio"],
                            temperature=0.8,
                            max_response_output_tokens="inf",
                        )
                    )
                )

                start_session_message = await anext(client.listen())
                logger.info(
                    f"Session started: {start_session_message.session.id} model: {start_session_message.session.model}"
                )

                agent = cls(
                    client=client,
                    tools=tools,
                    channel=channel,
                )
                await agent.run()

        finally:
            await channel.disconnect()
            await client.shutdown()
```

### Initialize the RealtimeKitAgent

The constructor for `RealtimeKitAgent` sets up the OpenAI client, optional tools, and Agora channel to manage real-time audio communication. In `agent.py`, add the following code after the `setup_and_run_agent` method:

```python
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        connection: RealtimeApiConnection,
        tools: ToolContext | None,
        channel: Channel,
    ) -> None:
        self.connection = connection
        self.tools = tools
        self._client_tool_futures = {}
        self.channel = channel
        self.subscribe_user = None
        self.write_pcm = os.environ.get("WRITE_AGENT_PCM", "false") == "true"
        logger.info(f"Write PCM: {self.write_pcm}")
```

### Launch the Agent

The `run` method is the core of the `RealtimeKitAgent`. It manages the agent’s operations by handling audio streams, subscribing to remote users, and processing both incoming and outgoing messages. This method also ensures proper exception handling and graceful shutdown. Following are the key functions of this method:

- **Waiting for remote users**: The agent waits for a remote user to join the Agora channel and subscribes to their audio stream.
- **Task management**: The agent initiates tasks for audio input, audio output, and processing messages from OpenAI, ensuring that they run concurrently.
- **Connection state handling**: It monitors changes in connection state and handles user disconnections, ensuring the agent shuts down gracefully.

In `agent.py`, replace the `run` placeholder with the following:

```python
    async def run(self) -> None:
        try:

            def log_exception(t: asyncio.Task[Any]) -> None:
                if not t.cancelled() and t.exception():
                    logger.error(
                        "unhandled exception",
                        exc_info=t.exception(),
                    )

            logger.info("Waiting for remote user to join")
            self.subscribe_user = await wait_for_remote_user(self.channel)
            logger.info(f"Subscribing to user {self.subscribe_user}")
            await self.channel.subscribe_audio(self.subscribe_user)

            async def on_user_left(
                agora_rtc_conn: RTCConnection, user_id: int, reason: int
            ):
                logger.info(f"User left: {user_id}")
                if self.subscribe_user == user_id:
                    self.subscribe_user = None
                    logger.info("Subscribed user left, disconnecting")
                    await self.channel.disconnect()

            self.channel.on("user_left", on_user_left)

            disconnected_future = asyncio.Future[None]()

            def callback(agora_rtc_conn: RTCConnection, conn_info: RTCConnInfo, reason):
                logger.info(f"Connection state changed: {conn_info.state}")
                if conn_info.state == 1:
                    if not disconnected_future.done():
                        disconnected_future.set_result(None)

            self.channel.on("connection_state_changed", callback)

            asyncio.create_task(self.rtc_to_model()).add_done_callback(log_exception)
            asyncio.create_task(self.model_to_rtc()).add_done_callback(log_exception)

            asyncio.create_task(self._process_model_messages()).add_done_callback(
                log_exception
            )

            await disconnected_future
            logger.info("Agent finished running")
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            logger.info("Agent cancelled")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error running agent: {e}")
            raise
```

### Communicate with the AI model

The `RealtimeKitAgent` is responsible for managing real-time audio communication between Agora and OpenAI’s AI model. It implements this through two core streaming methods:

- `rtc_to_model`: Captures audio frames from the Agora channel and streams them to OpenAI’s model for processing.
- `model_to_rtc`: Handles the output by pushing audio responses from OpenAI’s model back to the Agora channel for playback.

Additionally, the agent must process messages received from the OpenAI model. This is handled by the `_process_model_messages` method.

#### Stream input audio to the AI model

The `rtc_to_model` method captures audio frames from the Agora channel and streams them to OpenAI’s model for processing. This method runs continuously, retrieving audio frames from the subscribed user and forwarding them through the OpenAI API.

The code implements the following key features:

- **Subscription check**: Ensures that a remote user is subscribed before capturing any audio frames.
- **Audio frame processing**: Sends each audio frame from the Agora channel to OpenAI’s model.
- **Error handling**: Logs any errors that occur during the audio streaming process.

Replace the `rtc_to_model` placeholder in `agent.py` with the following implementation:

```python
    async def rtc_to_model(self) -> None:
        if self.subscribe_user is None:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

        audio_frames = self.channel.get_audio_frames(self.subscribe_user)

        # Initialize PCMWriter for receiving audio
        pcm_writer = PCMWriter(prefix="rtc_to_model", write_pcm=self.write_pcm)

        try:
            async for audio_frame in audio_frames:
                # Process received audio (send to model)
                _monitor_queue_size(self.audio_queue, "audio_queue")
                await self.connection.send_audio_data(audio_frame.data)

                # Write PCM data if enabled
                await pcm_writer.write(audio_frame.data)

                await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control to allow other tasks to run

        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # Write any remaining PCM data before exiting
            await pcm_writer.flush()
            raise  # Re-raise the exception to propagate cancellation
```

#### Stream audio queue to audio output

The `model_to_rtc` method streams audio generated by OpenAI’s model back to the Agora channel. It retrieves audio data from an internal queue and pushes it to Agora for real-time playback.

The code implements the following key features:

- **Audio queue management**: Retrieves audio data from an asynchronous queue filled with responses from OpenAI’s model.
- **Efficient task management**: After processing each audio frame, the method yields control to ensure other tasks can run concurrently.
- **Real-time playback**: Audio data is pushed to the Agora channel for immediate playback to the user.

Replace the `model_to_rtc` placeholder in `agent.py` with the following implementation:

```python
    async def model_to_rtc(self) -> None:
        # Initialize PCMWriter for sending audio
        pcm_writer = PCMWriter(prefix="model_to_rtc", write_pcm=self.write_pcm)

        try:
            while True:
                # Get audio frame from the model output
                frame = await self.audio_queue.get()

                # Process sending audio (to RTC)
                await self.channel.push_audio_frame(frame)

                # Write PCM data if enabled
                await pcm_writer.write(frame)

        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # Write any remaining PCM data before exiting
            await pcm_writer.flush()
            raise  # Re-raise the cancelled exception to properly exit the task
```

#### Process model messages

In addition to handling audio streaming, the agent must process messages received from the OpenAI model. Message processing in `RealtimeKitAgent` is central to how the agent interacts with OpenAI’s model and the Agora channel. Messages received from the model can include audio data, text transcripts, or other responses, and the agent needs to process these accordingly to ensure smooth real-time communication.

The `_process_model_messages` method listens for incoming messages and handles them according to their type, ensuring the appropriate action is taken, such as playing back audio, sending text transcripts, or invoking tools.

```python
async def _process_model_messages(self) -> None:
    # Continuously listen for incoming messages from OpenAI
    async for message in self.client.listen():
        match message:
            # Handle different message types
```

Key features implemented by `_process_model_messages`:

- **Listening for messages**: The agent continuously listens for incoming messages from OpenAI’s model.
- **Handling audio data**: If the message contains audio data, it is placed in a queue for playback to the Agora channel.
- **Handling transcripts**: If the message contains partial or final text transcripts, they are processed and sent to the Agora chat.
- **Handling other responses**: Additional message types, such as tool invocations and other outputs are processed as needed.

### Audio and message flow

The first case in `_process_model_messages` method is `InputAudioBufferSpeechStarted`. When this event is triggered, the system clears the sender’s audio buffer on the Agora channel and empties the local audio queue to ensure no prior audio interferes with the new input. It also logs the event for tracking purposes, allowing the agent to effectively manage and process incoming audio streams.

```python
case InputAudioBufferSpeechStarted():
    await self.channel.clear_sender_audio_buffer()
    # Clear the audio queue so audio stops playing
    while not self.audio_queue.empty():
        self.audio_queue.get_nowait()
    logger.info(f"TMS:InputAudioBufferSpeechStarted: item_id: {message.item_id}")

```

#### Response Messages

The `_process_model_messages` method is also responsible for handling both audio and text responses in real time. It processes various message types by managing audio data and sending text messages to the Agora chat channel.

When an audio delta message is received, the system decodes the audio and adds it to the local audio queue for playback, while also logging the event for reference. For transcript updates, the agent sends the corresponding text message to the chat asynchronously, ensuring that message handling does not block other processes. Finally, when the transcript is complete, the system logs the event and sends the final message to the Agora chat.

```python
case ResponseAudioDelta():
    # logger.info("Received audio message")
    self.audio_queue.put_nowait(base64.b64decode(message.delta))
    # loop.call_soon_threadsafe(self.audio_queue.put_nowait, base64.b64decode(message.delta))
    logger.info(f"TMS:ResponseAudioDelta: response_id:{message.response_id},item_id: {message.item_id}")

case ResponseAudioTranscriptDelta():
    # logger.info(f"Received text message {message=}")
    asyncio.create_task(self.channel.chat.send_message(
        ChatMessage(
            message=to_json(message), msg_id=message.item_id
        )
    ))

case ResponseAudioTranscriptDone():
    logger.info(f"Text message done: {message=}")
    asyncio.create_task(self.channel.chat.send_message(
        ChatMessage(
            message=to_json(message), msg_id=message.item_id
        )
    ))
```

#### Handling message responses

Following is the full implementation of `_process_model_messages` that incorporates code snippets from previous sections. In the full implementation, audio input events are handled by clearing audio buffers and queues when speech starts or stops. Audio deltas are decoded and placed into the local queue, while transcript messages are sent asynchronously to the Agora chat.

The agent can be extended to support a variety of other message types, including tool calls, errors, and other outputs from OpenAI’s model. If the agent encounters an unhandled message type, it logs a warning to notify developers for further investigation.

```python
    async def _process_model_messages(self) -> None:
        async for message in self.connection.listen():
            # logger.info(f"Received message {message=}")
            match message:
                case InputAudioBufferSpeechStarted():
                    await self.channel.clear_sender_audio_buffer()
                    # clear the audio queue so audio stops playing
                    while not self.audio_queue.empty():
                        self.audio_queue.get_nowait()
                    logger.info(f"TMS:InputAudioBufferSpeechStarted: item_id: {message.item_id}")

                case InputAudioBufferSpeechStopped():
                    logger.info(f"TMS:InputAudioBufferSpeechStopped: item_id: {message.item_id}")
                    pass

                case ResponseAudioDelta():
                    # logger.info("Received audio message")
                    self.audio_queue.put_nowait(base64.b64decode(message.delta))
                    # loop.call_soon_threadsafe(self.audio_queue.put_nowait, base64.b64decode(message.delta))
                    logger.info(f"TMS:ResponseAudioDelta: response_id:{message.response_id},item_id: {message.item_id}")

                case ResponseAudioTranscriptDelta():
                    # logger.info(f"Received text message {message=}")
                    asyncio.create_task(self.channel.chat.send_message(
                        ChatMessage(
                            message=to_json(message), msg_id=message.item_id
                        )
                    ))

                case ResponseAudioTranscriptDone():
                    logger.info(f"Text message done: {message=}")
                    asyncio.create_task(self.channel.chat.send_message(
                        ChatMessage(
                            message=to_json(message), msg_id=message.item_id
                        )
                    ))

                #  InputAudioBufferCommitted
                case InputAudioBufferCommitted():
                    pass
                case ItemCreated():
                    pass
                # ResponseCreated
                case ResponseCreated():
                    pass
                # ResponseDone
                case ResponseDone():
                    pass
                # ResponseOutputItemAdded
                case ResponseOutputItemAdded():
                    pass
                # ResponseContenPartAdded
                case ResponseContentPartAdded():
                    pass
                # ResponseAudioDone
                case ResponseAudioDone():
                    pass
                # ResponseContentPartDone
                case ResponseContentPartDone():
                    pass
                # ResponseOutputItemDone
                case ResponseOutputItemDone():
                    pass
                case SessionUpdated():
                    pass
                case RateLimitsUpdated():
                    pass
                case _:
                    logger.warning(f"Unhandled message {message=}")
```

Using these components, the agent handles audio, transcripts, and other messages in real-time, ensuring that it responds appropriately to OpenAI model’s output and maintains seamless communication with the Agora channel.

### Wait for a remote user

The `wait_for_remote_user` function is a key component of the agent's functionality. It listens for an event where a remote user joins the Agora channel. This function will block until a user joins or until it times out.

The method implements the following:

- **Event listener**: The function listens for the `user_joined` event from the Agora SDK. When a user joins the channel, it captures the user ID and signals that a user has joined using `remote_user_joined.set()`.
- **Timeout handling**: If no user joins within the specified `timeout`, a `TimeoutError` is raised and logged as an error.
- **Cleanup**: After successfully getting a user ID or timing out, the event listener is removed using `channel.off("user_joined", on_user_joined)`.

In `agent.py`, replace the `wait_for_remote_user` placeholder code with:

```python
async def wait_for_remote_user(channel: Channel) -> int:
    remote_users = list(channel.remote_users.keys())
    if len(remote_users) > 0:
        return remote_users[0]

    future = asyncio.Future[int]()

    channel.once("user_joined", lambda conn, user_id: future.set_result(user_id))

    try:
        # Wait for the remote user with a timeout of 30 seconds
        remote_user = await asyncio.wait_for(future, timeout=15.0)
        return remote_user
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        future.cancel()

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error waiting for remote user: {e}")
        raise
```

### Utils

In the `Agent.py` file, we initialize a `PCMWriter` instance, which is responsible for writing audio frames to a file that is sent to the AI for processing. The `PCMWriter` class, along with its methods, is defined in the `utils.py` file.

```python
import asyncio
import functools
from datetime import datetime


def write_pcm_to_file(buffer: bytearray, file_name: str) -> None:
    """Helper function to write PCM data to a file."""
    with open(file_name, "ab") as f:  # append to file
        f.write(buffer)


def generate_file_name(prefix: str) -> str:
    # Create a timestamp for the file name
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    return f"{prefix}_{timestamp}.pcm"


class PCMWriter:
    def __init__(self, prefix: str, write_pcm: bool, buffer_size: int = 1024 * 64):
        self.write_pcm = write_pcm
        self.buffer = bytearray()
        self.buffer_size = buffer_size
        self.file_name = generate_file_name(prefix) if write_pcm else None
        self.loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    async def write(self, data: bytes) -> None:
        """Accumulate data into the buffer and write to file when necessary."""
        if not self.write_pcm:
            return

        self.buffer.extend(data)

        # Write to file if buffer is full
        if len(self.buffer) >= self.buffer_size:
            await self._flush()

    async def flush(self) -> None:
        """Write any remaining data in the buffer to the file."""
        if self.write_pcm and self.buffer:
            await self._flush()

    async def _flush(self) -> None:
        """Helper method to write the buffer to the file."""
        if self.file_name:
            await self.loop.run_in_executor(
                None,
                functools.partial(write_pcm_to_file, self.buffer[:], self.file_name),
            )
        self.buffer.clear()

```

### Tool Management

Every agent needs a tool management system to extend the agent's functionality by allowing OpenAI’s model to invoke specific tools. These tools can either run locally or pass data back to the model for further processing. By registering tools and executing them based on incoming messages, the agent adds the capability and flexibility to handle a variety of tasks.

Tool management implements the following key features:

- **Tool registration**: Register both local function tools and pass-through tools, making them available for execution.
- **Tool execution**: Execute tools in response to requests from the OpenAI model, running them locally or passing data back to the model.
- **Tool context**: The `ToolContext` class manages the tools, providing methods to register and execute them as needed.

Open the `tools.py` file and add the following code to import the required packages.

```python
import abc
import json
import logging
from typing import Any, Callable, assert_never

from attr import dataclass
from pydantic import BaseModel

from .logger import setup_logger

# Set up the logger with color and timestamp support
logger = setup_logger(name=__name__, log_level=logging.INFO)
```

#### Define Local and Passthrough tools

When setting up tools, define if the tool is executed directly by the agent on the local context, or if it sends data back to OpenAI’s model.

- **Local function tools**: Executed directly by the agent on the local context.
- **Pass-through tools**: Send data back to OpenAI’s model without it being executed locally.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class LocalFunctionToolDeclaration:
    """Declaration of a tool that can be called by the model, and runs a function locally on the tool context."""

    name: str
    description: str
    parameters: dict[str, Any]
    function: Callable[..., Any]

    def model_description(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": self.name,
                "description": self.description,
                "parameters": self.parameters,
            },
        }

@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class PassThroughFunctionToolDeclaration:
    """Declaration of a tool that can be called by the model."""

    name: str
    description: str
    parameters: dict[str, Any]

    def model_description(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": self.name,
                "description": self.description,
                "parameters": self.parameters,
            },
        }

ToolDeclaration = LocalFunctionToolDeclaration | PassThroughFunctionToolDeclaration
```

The `ToolContext` class manages all available tools. It provides the logic for both registering tools and executing them when requested by the OpenAI model. Once tools are registered, the agent can execute them in response to messages from OpenAI’s model. The agent listens for tool call requests and either executes the tool locally or passes data back to the model.

In the `ToolContext` class, the `execute_tool` method retrieves the tool by name and runs it with the provided arguments. If it is a local function tool, the agent executes the function and returns the result. If it is a pass-through tool, it simply returns the decoded arguments to the model for further processing.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class LocalToolCallExecuted:
    json_encoded_output: str


@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class ShouldPassThroughToolCall:
    decoded_function_args: dict[str, Any]


ExecuteToolCallResult = LocalToolCallExecuted | ShouldPassThroughToolCall
```

#### Tool registration and invocation

Registering tools during the setup process makes them available for the model to call.

```python
class ToolContext(abc.ABC):
    _tool_declarations: dict[str, ToolDeclaration]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # TODO should be an ordered dict
        self._tool_declarations = {}

    def register_function(
        self,
        *,
        name: str,
        description: str = "",
        parameters: dict[str, Any],
        fn: Callable[..., Any],
    ) -> None:
        self._tool_declarations[name] = LocalFunctionToolDeclaration(
            name=name, description=description, parameters=parameters, function=fn
        )

    def register_client_function(
        self,
        *,
        name: str,
        description: str = "",
        parameters: dict[str, Any],
    ) -> None:
        self._tool_declarations[name] = PassThroughFunctionToolDeclaration(
            name=name, description=description, parameters=parameters
        )

    async def execute_tool(
        self, tool_name: str, encoded_function_args: str
    ) -> ExecuteToolCallResult | None:
        tool = self._tool_declarations.get(tool_name)
        if not tool:
            return None

        args = json.loads(encoded_function_args)
        assert isinstance(args, dict)

        if isinstance(tool, LocalFunctionToolDeclaration):
            logger.info(f"Executing tool {tool_name} with args {args}")
            result = await tool.function(**args)
            logger.info(f"Tool {tool_name} executed with result {result}")
            return LocalToolCallExecuted(json_encoded_output=json.dumps(result))

        if isinstance(tool, PassThroughFunctionToolDeclaration):
            return ShouldPassThroughToolCall(decoded_function_args=args)

        assert_never(tool)

    def model_description(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        return [v.model_description() for v in self._tool_declarations.values()]

```

#### Tool invocation in message processing

It is important to highlight how tools are invoked. During message processing, certain messages may trigger tool invocations, prompting the agent to execute the relevant tool.

The following flow illustrates how this works:

1. The OpenAI model sends a message that includes a tool call.
2. The `_process_model_messages` method identifies the tool call request.
3. The agent retrieves the relevant tool from the `ToolContext` and executes it, either locally or by passing data back to the model.

This integration between **message processing** and **tool management** ensures that the agent can extend its capabilities dynamically, performing tasks or calculations in real-time based on incoming requests.

The `ClientToolCallResponse` model represents the response after a tool is invoked and processed. This class is designed to represent the response of a client-side tool call, where the `tool_call_id` uniquely identifies the tool call, and the result can take on multiple data types, representing the output of that call. The flexibility in the result field allows for a wide variety of responses.

```python
class ClientToolCallResponse(BaseModel):
    tool_call_id: str
    result: dict[str, Any] | str | float | int | bool | None = None
```

With these pieces in place, the agent can effectively manage tool registration and execution, ensuring that it can handle a variety of tasks as directed by the OpenAI model. This structure allows the agent to either execute functions locally or pass them to the model for further handling.

## Set up a server

The `main.py` script orchestrates the initialization of an HTTP server that allows clients to start and stop AI-driven agents in Agora voice channels. It includes routes for starting and stopping agents, manages processes for different channels, and handles cleanup and shutdown procedures. The agents run as separate processes, ensuring they can handle real-time interactions without blocking the main server. The application leverages `aiohttp` for handling HTTP requests, `multiprocessing` to manage agent processes, and `asyncio` for non-blocking execution.

Open `main.py` and add the following code to set up the imports and load the `.env` variables.

```python
import asyncio
import logging
import os
import signal
from multiprocessing import Process

from aiohttp import web
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError

from .realtime.struct import PCM_CHANNELS, PCM_SAMPLE_RATE, ServerVADUpdateParams, Voices

from .agent import InferenceConfig, RealtimeKitAgent
from agora_realtime_ai_api.rtc import RtcEngine, RtcOptions
from .logger import setup_logger
from .parse_args import parse_args, parse_args_realtimekit

# Load and validate the environment variables
load_dotenv(override=True)
app_id = os.environ.get("AGORA_APP_ID")
app_cert = os.environ.get("AGORA_APP_CERT")

if not app_id:
    raise ValueError("AGORA_APP_ID must be set in the environment.")

class StartAgentRequestBody(BaseModel):
    channel_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the channel")
    uid: int = Field(..., description="The UID of the user")
    language: str = Field("en", description="The language of the agent")

class StopAgentRequestBody(BaseModel):
    channel_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the channel")
```

### Process management and signal handling

The monitor_process function asynchronously monitors each agent process, ensuring that once it finishes, the process is cleaned up. `handle_agent_proc_signal` ensures that any agent receiving a termination signal exits gracefully. This process management ensures that the application can run multiple agents concurrently while maintaining proper resource management.

```python
async def monitor_process(channel_name: str, process: Process):
    # Wait for the process to finish in a non-blocking way
    await asyncio.to_thread(process.join)

    logger.info(f"Process for channel {channel_name} has finished")

    # Perform additional work after the process finishes
    # For example, removing the process from the active_processes dictionary
    if channel_name in active_processes:
        active_processes.pop(channel_name)

    # Perform any other cleanup or additional actions you need here
    logger.info(f"Cleanup for channel {channel_name} completed")

    logger.info(f"Remaining active processes: {len(active_processes.keys())}")

def handle_agent_proc_signal(signum, frame):
    logger.info(f"Agent process received signal {signal.strsignal(signum)}. Exiting...")
    os._exit(0)
```

### Run the agent

The `run_agent_in_process` method starts a `RealtimeKitAgent` in a new process, handling Agora RTC initialization with the necessary credentials and agent configuration.

```python
def run_agent_in_process(
    engine_app_id: str,
    engine_app_cert: str,
    channel_name: str,
    uid: int,
    inference_config: InferenceConfig,
):  # Set up signal forwarding in the child process
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_agent_proc_signal)  # Forward SIGINT
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_agent_proc_signal)  # Forward SIGTERM
    asyncio.run(
        RealtimeKitAgent.setup_and_run_agent(
            engine=RtcEngine(appid=engine_app_id, appcert=engine_app_cert),
            options=RtcOptions(
                channel_name=channel_name,
                uid=uid,
                sample_rate=PCM_SAMPLE_RATE,
                channels=PCM_CHANNELS,
                enable_pcm_dump= os.environ.get("WRITE_RTC_PCM", "false") == "true"
            ),
            inference_config=inference_config,
            tools=None,
        )
    )
```

### HTTP Routes for Managing Agents

The `start_agent` and `stop_agent` routes are the main HTTP endpoints that allow clients to control the agents. As part of the start and stop we need to keep track of the `active_processes`.

```python
# Dictionary to keep track of processes by channel name or UID
active_processes = {}
```

When a POST request is made to `/start_agent`, the server validates the request, starts a new agent process (if one isn’t already running), and begins monitoring it. The processes are stored in an `active_processes` dictionary for efficient management.

```python
async def start_agent(request):
    try:
        # Parse and validate JSON body using the pydantic model
        try:
            data = await request.json()
            validated_data = StartAgentRequestBody(**data)
        except ValidationError as e:
            return web.json_response(
                {"error": "Invalid request data", "details": e.errors()}, status=400
            )

        # Parse JSON body
        channel_name = validated_data.channel_name
        uid = validated_data.uid
        language = validated_data.language

        # Check if a process is already running for the given channel_name
        if (
            channel_name in active_processes
            and active_processes[channel_name].is_alive()
        ):
            return web.json_response(
                {"error": f"Agent already running for channel: {channel_name}"},
                status=400,
            )

        system_message = ""
        if language == "en":
            system_message = """\

        process = Process(
            target=run_agent_in_process,
            args=(app_id, app_cert, channel_name, uid, inference_config),
        )

        try:
            process.start()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to start agent process: {e}")
            return web.json_response(
                {"error": f"Failed to start agent: {e}"}, status=500
            )

        # Store the process in the active_processes dictionary using channel_name as the key
        active_processes[channel_name] = process

        # Monitor the process in a background asyncio task
        asyncio.create_task(monitor_process(channel_name, process))

        return web.json_response({"status": "Agent started!"})

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to start agent: {e}")
        return web.json_response({"error": str(e)}, status=500)
```

The `stop_agent` route handles requests to stop an active agent. It first validates the request body using `StopAgentRequestBody`. If a process is found for the specified channel, it terminates the process using `os.kill` and sends a `SIGKILL` signal. The process is then removed from the `active_processes` dictionary, and a response is returned to confirm termination. If no process is found, a 404 error is returned, indicating the agent was not active.

```python
# HTTP Server Routes: Stop Agent
async def stop_agent(request):
    try:
        # Parse and validate JSON body using the pydantic model
        try:
            data = await request.json()
            validated_data = StopAgentRequestBody(**data)
        except ValidationError as e:
            return web.json_response(
                {"error": "Invalid request data", "details": e.errors()}, status=400
            )

        # Parse JSON body
        channel_name = validated_data.channel_name

        # Find and terminate the process associated with the given channel name
        process = active_processes.get(channel_name)

        if process and process.is_alive():
            logger.info(f"Terminating process for channel {channel_name}")
            await asyncio.to_thread(os.kill, process.pid, signal.SIGKILL)

            return web.json_response(
                {"status": "Agent process terminated", "channel_name": channel_name}
            )
        else:
            return web.json_response(
                {"error": "No active agent found for the provided channel_name"},
                status=404,
            )

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to stop agent: {e}")
        return web.json_response({"error": str(e)}, status=500)

```

### Shutdown gracefully

The `shutdown` function is responsible for cleaning up agent processes when the server is shutting down. It iterates through all the processes in `active_processes` and terminates any that are still alive, ensuring no orphaned processes remain. This is essential for graceful shutdowns, preventing resource leaks. Once all processes are terminated, it clears the `active_processes` dictionary to reset the server state.

```python
async def shutdown(app):
    logger.info("Shutting down server, cleaning up processes...")
    for channel_name, process in active_processes.items():
        if process.is_alive():
            logger.info(
                f"Terminating process for channel {channel_name} (PID: {process.pid})"
            )
            await asyncio.to_thread(os.kill, process.pid, signal.SIGKILL)
            await asyncio.to_thread(process.join)  # Ensure process has terminated
    active_processes.clear()
    logger.info("All processes terminated, shutting down server")


# Signal handler to gracefully stop the application
def handle_signal(signum, frame):
    logger.info(f"Received exit signal {signal.strsignal(signum)}...")

    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    if loop.is_running():
        # Properly shutdown by stopping the loop and running shutdown
        loop.create_task(shutdown(None))
        loop.stop()
```

### aiohttp application setup

The `init_app` function sets up the core `aiohttp` web application. It defines the HTTP routes for starting and stopping AI agents with the `/start_agent` and `/stop_agent` endpoints, and attaches a cleanup task to properly shut down processes when the server exits. The function returns the initialized app object, ready to be managed by the event loop and handle incoming requests.

```python
async def init_app():
    app = web.Application()

    # Add cleanup task to run on app exit
    app.on_cleanup.append(shutdown)

    app.add_routes([web.post("/start_agent", start_agent)])
    app.add_routes([web.post("/stop_agent", stop_agent)])

    return app
```

### Main Entry

Now that we have the entire agent setup, we are ready to bring it all together and implement the main entry point for our project. The main entry point of the program first parses the command-line arguments to determine whether the server should be started or an agent should be run directly. If server is chosen, it sets up the event loop and starts the `aiohttp` web server using `init_app()`, which binds the routes for starting and stopping agents. If agent is selected, it parses the `RealtimeKit` options and starts an agent process using `run_agent_in_process`. This structure allows the application to either act as a server managing agents or run an individual agent directly, depending on the context.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Parse the action argument
    args = parse_args()
    # Action logic based on the action argument
    if args.action == "server":
        # Python 3.10+ requires explicitly creating a new event loop if none exists
        try:
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        except RuntimeError:
            # For Python 3.10+, use this to get a new event loop if the default is closed or not created
            loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
            asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

        # Start the application using asyncio.run for the new event loop
        app = loop.run_until_complete(init_app())
        web.run_app(app, port=int(os.getenv("SERVER_PORT") or "8080"))
    elif args.action == "agent":
        # Parse RealtimeKitOptions for running the agent
        realtime_kit_options = parse_args_realtimekit()

        # Example logging for parsed options (channel_name and uid)
        logger.info(f"Running agent with options: {realtime_kit_options}")

## Parse Args and Logger

This project implements a few helper functions to support in parsing command line arguments and to handle logging. The setup of these components is beyond the scope of this guide, but for the purposes of providing a complete working codebase, the code for each is included below.

### Parse Args

```python
import argparse
import logging
from typing import TypedDict

from .logger import setup_logger

# Set up the logger with color and timestamp support
logger = setup_logger(name=__name__, log_level=logging.INFO)


class RealtimeKitOptions(TypedDict):
    channel_name: str
    uid: int

def parse_args():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Manage server and agent actions.")

    # Create a subparser for actions (server and agent)
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="action", required=True)

    # Subparser for the 'server' action (no additional arguments)
    subparsers.add_parser("server", help="Start the server")

    # Subparser for the 'agent' action (with required arguments)
    agent_parser = subparsers.add_parser("agent", help="Run an agent")
    agent_parser.add_argument("--channel_name", required=True, help="Channel Id / must")
    agent_parser.add_argument("--uid", type=int, default=0, help="User Id / default is 0")

    return parser.parse_args()


def parse_args_realtimekit() -> RealtimeKitOptions:
    args = parse_args()
    logger.info(f"Parsed arguments: {args}")

    if args.action == "agent":
        options: RealtimeKitOptions = {"channel_name": args.channel_name, "uid": args.uid}
        return options

    return None
```

### Logger

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

import colorlog


def setup_logger(
    name: str,
    log_level: int = logging.INFO,
    log_format: str = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    use_color: bool = True
) -> logging.Logger:
    """Sets up and returns a logger with color and timestamp support, including milliseconds."""

    # Create or get a logger with the given name
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)

    # Prevent the logger from propagating to the root logger (disable extra output)
    logger.propagate = False

    # Clear existing handlers to avoid duplicate messages
    if logger.hasHandlers():
        logger.handlers.clear()

    # Set the log level
    logger.setLevel(log_level)

    # Create console handler
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    # Custom formatter for adding milliseconds
    class CustomFormatter(colorlog.ColoredFormatter):
        def formatTime(self, record, datefmt=None):
            record_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(record.created)
            if datefmt:
                return record_time.strftime(datefmt) + f",{int(record.msecs):03d}"
            else:
                return record_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") + f",{int(record.msecs):03d}"

    # Use custom formatter that includes milliseconds
    if use_color:
        formatter = CustomFormatter(
            "%(log_color)s" + log_format,
            datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",  # Milliseconds will be appended manually
            log_colors={
                "DEBUG": "cyan",
                "INFO": "green",
                "WARNING": "yellow",
                "ERROR": "red",
                "CRITICAL": "bold_red",
            },
        )
    else:
        formatter = CustomFormatter(log_format, datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    # Add the handler to the logger
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    return logger
```

## Test the Code

### Setup and run the backend

To set up and run the backend, take the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have updated the files in the `realtime_agent` folder with
   the [complete code](#complete-integration-code).

1. Update the values for `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERT`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the project's `.env` file.

   Ensure that the necessary credentials for Agora and OpenAI are correctly configured.

1. Execute the following command to run the demo agent:

   ```bash
   python -m realtime_agent.main agent --channel_name=<channel_name> --uid=<agent_uid>
   ```

   Replace `<channel_name>` with the desired channel name and `<agent_uid>` with a unique user ID.

### Start HTTP server

To start the HTTP server:

    ```bash
    python -m realtime_agent.main server
    ```

The server provides a simple layer for managing agent processes.

#### POST /start_agent

This api starts an agent with given graph and override properties. The started agent joins the specified channel, and subscribes to the uid which your browser/device's rtc used to join.

| Param          | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channel_name` | Use the same channel name that your browser/device joins, agent needs to be in the same channel to communicate. |
| `uid`          | The user ID that the AI agent uses to join.                                                                     |

Example:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/start_agent' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "channel_name": "test",
    "uid": 123
  }'
```

#### POST /stop_agent

This api stops the agent you started.

| Param          | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `channel_name` | Use the same channel name you used to start the agent. |

Example:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/stop_agent' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "channel_name": "test"
  }'
```
