export const toc = [{}];

Real-Time STT v6.x is a major upgrade from v5.x, designed for simplicity by removing redundant fields. This version also introduces new features, including the removal of destination fields and support for `uidLanguages` functions.

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
The Real-Time STT v5.x has entered its sunset phase. We strongly recommend migrating to the v6.x.
</Admonition>

This page explains how to migrate from v5.x to v6.x.

### What has changed

The Real-Time STT v6.x introduces a more streamlined approach by removing certain functions that were previously available in earlier versions. Hereâ€™s what has changed:

1. **Cross-channel audio subscription and subtitle push removed**

    * **v5.x**: You could subscribe to audio from Channel A and push the transcribed or translated subtitles to Channel B.
    * **v6.x**: This is no longer supported. The Real-Time STT v6.x only allows subscribing to audio within the same channel and pushing subtitles to that same channel.
1. **Multi-OSS/S3 storage for subtitle files removed**

    * **v5.x**: You could store subtitle files in multiple OSS/S3 storage locations.
    * **v6.x**: You can only upload subtitles to a single OSS/S3 storage location.
1. **Redundant fields removed**

    * Some unnecessary fields have been removed to simplify real-time REST APIs.
    * Examples of removed fields:
        * `config.recognizeConfig.model`
        * `audio.subscribeSource`

These changes are aimed at reducing complexity and making real-time STT more efficient.

### Migrate to v6.x manually

The figure compares two versions of the REST API used for enabling Real-Time STT, translation, and offline subtitles in the same channel.  

- **Left side**: v5.x REST API  
- **Right side**: v6.x REST API  
- **Fields marked in red**: New fields required when migrating from v5.x to v6.x

#### Migration steps
1. **Channel and user authentication changes**  
   - **v5.x:** `channelName`, `uid`, `token`  
   - **v6.x:** Replaced by `channelName`, `subBotUid`, and `subBotToken` inside the `rtcConfig` structure.  

2. **Idle time setting**  
   - **v5.x:** `maxIdleTime`  
   - **v6.x:** Directly replaced by the `maxIdleTime` field at the top level of the structure.  

3. **Language configuration**  
   - **v5.x:** `language` (comma-separated for multiple languages)  
   - **v6.x:** Replaced by `languages` at the top level.  
     - **Change:** Instead of a comma-separated string, each language is now an individual item in an array.  

4. **Publisher bot authentication**  
   - **v5.x:** `uid`, `token`  
   - **v6.x:** Replaced by `pubBotUid` and `pubBotToken` inside the `rtcConfig` structure.  

5. **Storage configuration changes**  
   - **v5.x:** `storageConfig`  
   - **v6.x:** Replaced by `captionConfig.storage`, with all fields mapped one-to-one as needed.  

6. **Translation configuration**  
   - **v5.x:** `translateConfig` (as a structure)  
   - **v6.x:** Directly replaced by the `translateConfig` field in the new version.  

### Migrate using a Go script

To convert a v5.x REST API to v6.x, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides a [Go script](https://goplay.tools/snippet/FnxvFiaFRW1). To use this script:

1. Replace the highlighted area in the rectangular box with your v5.x REST API.
1. Click **Run** to generate the v6.x request body.
1. Use the v6.x REST API to start an STT task and compare it with the v5.x version to check for differences.
