This section guides you through how to integrate APNs with Chat

## Integrate APNs push

To integrate APNs into Chat, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a push certificate on the Apple Developer Platform

APNs supports p8 and p12 certificates. The Agora server needs your APNs certificate to communicate with APNs and send push notifications to the client.

The following steps describe how to create a p12 certificate on [Apple's developer platform](https://developer.apple.com/) :

1. Apply for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file

1. Open the Keychain Access app on your device and select **Keychain Access** > **Certificate Assistant** > **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority**.
1. In the **Certificate Assistant** dialog box, fill in the **User Email Address** and **Common Name**, select **Saved to disk** for **Request is**, click **Continue**, and add a storage path to save the file.

1. The CSR file `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` is generated under the storage path.

### 2. Create an App ID

1. Log in to [iOS Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/cn/)，choose **Account** > **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** > **Identifiers*.
1. On the Identifiers tab, click the **+** icon to the right of **Identifiers**.
1. On the **Register a new identifier** page, select **App IDs** and click **Continue**.
1. For **Select a type** , select **App** and click **Continue**.
1. On the **Register an App ID** page, configure the following fields:
   - **Description** : Description of the App ID.
   - **Bundle ID**: Can be set to **com.YourCompany.YourProjectName**.
   - **Capabilities**: Choose **Push Notification**.
1. Make sure the information is correct and click **Register**.

### 3. Create push notification certificates

Create certificates for development and production environments, respectively:

1. On the **Identifiers** tab, select the App ID created in the previous step.
1. On the **Edit your App ID Configuration** page, find **Push Notifications** and click **Configure**.
1. In the **Apple Push Notification service SSL Certificates** dialog box, click **Create Certificate** to create a push certificate for development or production environments.
1. On the **Create a New Certificate** page, select **iOS** as the **Platform**, upload the CSR file created in step 1, and click **Continue**.
1. On the **Download Your Certificate** page, click **Download** to generate the [APNs](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.14864088B1zf4p#/dev80c6204ec) certificate.

### 4. Generate the push certificate

 1. Double-click to import the push certificate created in Keychain in previous steps.
 1. Open **Keychain Access** , select **login** > **Certificates**, find the imported certificate, right-click and select the certificate to export as a `.p12` file, and set the certificate key.

### 5. Generate the Provisioning Profile file

1. Open [iOS Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/cn/)，select **Account** > **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** > **Profiles*.
1. On the **Provisioning** tab, click the **+** icon to the right of **Profiles**.
1. On the **Register a New Provisioning Profile** page, select **iOS App Development** for **Development**, select **Ad Hoc** for **Distribution**, and click **Continue**.

| Parameter        | Type    | Required | Description         |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------------- |
|  ** Certificate Type **       |   | Yes | Message push certificate type, currently supports ** p8 ** and ** p12 ** .         |
|  ** Certificate Name **       | String   | Yes | The name of the message push certificate. Enter the name of the message push certificate created in [ Step 3 ] ( ##step1-3 ) of [ Create a push certificate ] ( #certificate ) . |
|  ** Push Key **       | String   | Yes | Message push certificate key. Fill in the certificate key set when exporting the message push certificate file in [ Step 4 ] ( #step1-4 ) of [ Create a push certificate ] ( #certificate ) . This parameter needs to be configured only when using a p12 certificate.   |
|  ** Upload Certificate **       | File   | Yes | Click ` Upload` to upload the message push certificate file obtained in   [ Step 4 ] ( #step1-4 ) of [ Create a push certificate ] ( #certificate ) . |
|  ** Key ID **       | String   | Yes | Enter the Key ID of the push certificate. This parameter only needs to be configured when using a p8 certificate.   |
|  ** Team ID **       | String   | Yes | Enter the Team ID of the push certificate. This parameter only needs to be configured when using a p8 certificate.   |

### Integrate APNs on the client

1. Open Xcode and select ** Targets ** > ** Capability ** > ** Push Notifications ** to enable push notification permission.

2. Pass the certificate name to the SDK .

```Objective-C
#import <AgoraChat/AgoraChat.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Apply for notification permission
    UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
        [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionBadge | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert) completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error) {
            if (granted) {
                NSLog(@"request authorization succeed");
            }
        }];

    // Register push
    [application registerForRemoteNotifications];

    // Initialize options and set App Key
    AgoraChatOptions *options = [AgoraChatOptions optionsWithAppkey:@"XXXX#XXXX"];

    // Fill in the name you set when uploading the certificate. Make sure the certificate name you set here is consistent with the certificate name you filled in on the Agora console.
    options.apnsCertName = @"PushCertName";

    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient initializeSDKWithOptions:options];

    return YES;
}
```

3. Get the device token and pass it to the server .

After the device token is registered, the iOS system will call back the device token to you in the following way. You need to pass the device token to the SDK.

```Objective-C
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient registerForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken completion:^(AgoraChatError *aError) {
        if (aError) {
            NSLog(@"bind deviceToken error: %@", aError.errorDescription);
        }
    }];
}
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
    NSLog(@"Register Remote Notifications Failed");
}
```

## Test APNs push

After integrating and enabling APNs push in IM, you can test whether the push is successfully integrated.

Prerequisites​

Prepare a non-jailbroken device using iOS system.

To ensure reliable testing, avoid using a simulator for testing.

### Test Steps

1. Log in to the app on your device and confirm that the device token is successfully bound.
   You can check the log or call the [ RESTful API for getting user details ] ( https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/user-system-registration#querying-a-user ) to confirm whether the device token is successfully bound.
2. Kill the application process .
3. Send a test message in the Agora console .
Select ** Operation Management ** > ** User **    in the left navigation bar . On the Users page, select ** Send Admin Message ** in the ** Action ** column for the corresponding user ID . In the dialog box that pops up, select the message type, enter the message content, and then click ** Send ** .

   Note: In the **Push Certificate** page, in the **Action** column of each certificate, click **More**, and **Test** will appear. This is to directly call the third-party interface to push. The message sending test in the **Users** page first calls the instant messaging IM message sending interface, and then calls the third-party interface to push after the conditions are met (that is, the user is offline, the push certificate is valid and bound to the device token).

4. Check your device to see if it has received the push notification.

### troubleshooting

1. Check whether APNs push is correctly integrated or enabled in the IM.
Select ** Operation Management ** > ** User **    in the left navigation bar . On the user management page, select ** Push Certificate ** in the ** Action ** column for the corresponding user ID . In the pop-up box, check whether the certificate name and device token are displayed correctly.
2. Check whether the correct APNs certificate has been uploaded in the Agora console and the correct certificate environment has been set.
3. Check whether the message is pushed in the chat room. The chat room does not support offline message push.
4. Check whether the setting of only sending online messages is set ( ` AgoraChatMessage#deliverOnlineOnly = YES` ) . Messages only sent online will not be pushed.
