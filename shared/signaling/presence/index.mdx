In <Vg k="SIG" /> solutions, it is often important to know a user's current online status. For example, in instant messaging, chat applications, and online collaboration tools, users need to see the availability of their contacts. This information is typically displayed as a status message or icon next to a user's name. Presence features in <Vpd k="SDK" /> enable you to monitor join, leave, and status change notifications for users in a channel. Using Presence, you can:

- Get a list of users currently in a channel and their temporary status data.
- Get a list of channels a specified user has joined or is subscribed to.
- Get, set, or remove user statuses.
- Receive real-time event notifications when users join or leave specified channels.
- Receive user status change event notifications in real time.

## Understand the tech

Presence provides real-time information about the availability, and the current status of users, for effective communication and collaboration. It enables you to retrieve a list of users in a channel, or to query the list of channels for a specific user. The following figure illustrates how you integrate presence features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
