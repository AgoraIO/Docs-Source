## Project setup

To create a <Vpd  k="SDK" /> development environment:

<Setup />

## Implement Signaling

The code that goes here must have

  * Variables: signalingEngine, signalingManager, channelName. In the get started channel name is fixed.  APIkey etc as video calling.
  * All Agora code in signalingManager, all UI code in another class
  * Does the following:
  * Login and logout. signalingEngine is initiated at login and destroyed at logout.
  * joinChannle, leaveChannel
  * listen for events in the channel
  * Logging

<Implement />


## Test your implementation

This section explains how to run the sample project and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Best practice is to run this project on a physical mobile device, as some simulators may not support the full features of this project.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:

- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).

- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.

- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your server.

- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for channel messaging.
