1. **Integrate <Vg k="RTEE_DRM" /> into your app**

   To add the <Vg k="RTEE_DRM_FRAMEWORK" /> library, add the following to the top of the `ViewController` class:

   ```swift
   let amccConfig = AgoraMusicContentCenterConfig()
   var amcc: AgoraMusicContentCenter!
   ```

2. **Initialize variables to set <Vg k="RTEE_DRM" /> configurations**

    Add the following line in `initializeAgoraEngine` after `config.appId = appID`:

    ```swift
    amcc = AgoraMusicContentCenter.sharedContentCenter(with: amccConfig)
    ```

3. **Add media player to play copyright music**

    To create a player that adds DRM-related modules on the basis of AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol, do the following:

    1. Add a variable to hold the music player to the top of the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    var musicPlayer: AgoraMusicPlayerProtocol!
    ```

    2. To initialize the music player, add the following code to `initializeAgoraEngine` after `amcc = AgoraMusicContentCenter.sharedContentCenter(with: amccConfig)`:

    ```swift
    musicPlayer = amcc?.createMusicPlayer(with:self as! AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate)
    ```

4. **Search for songs**

    To search for a song through its title or singer, add this line after `musicPlayer = amcc?.createMusicPlayer(with:self as! AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate)` in `initializeAgoraEngine`:

    ```swift
    amcc.searchMusic(with:"hello", page:0, pageSize:10, jsonOption: nil)
    ```

5. **Get a list of song charts**

    There are two corresponding APIs for getting song chart lists.

    - To get a list of song lists, and return the names and IDs of all lists visible to the current appId, add this after `amcc.searchMusic(with:"hello", page:0, pageSize:10, jsonOption: nil)`:

    ```swift
    amcc.getMusicCharts()
    ```

    - For getting the music collection by a music chart id, add this code in `initializeAgoraEngine` before `agoraEngine = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(with: config, delegate: self)`:

    ```swift
    amcc.getMusicCollection(with:0, page:0, pageSize:10, jsonOption:nil)
    ```

6. **Preload songs**

    Currently for <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />, the songs need to be preloaded first, and can only be played after receiving a successful event response. To preload a song, in `initializeAgoraEngine`, put the following line after `musicPlayer = amcc?.createMusicPlayer(with:self as! AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate)`:

    ```swift
    amcc.preload(with: 1, jsonOption: nil)
    ```

    Additionally, to determine if the song is already loaded, add the following after `amcc.preload(with: 1, jsonOption: nil)`:

    ```swift
    amcc.isPreloaded(with: 1)
    ```

7. **Play preloaded songs**

    To play a preloaded song using the media player, put this code after `amcc.isPreloaded(with: 1)`:

    ```swift
    musicPlayer.openMedia(withSongCode: 1, startPos: 0)
    ```
