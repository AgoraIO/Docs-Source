Instant messaging connects people wherever they are and allows them to communicate with others in real time. With built-in user interfaces (UI) for the conversation list and contact list, the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat UIKit](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/Agoraagora-chat-uikit-web) enables you to quickly embed real-time messaging into your app without requiring extra effort on the UI.

This page shows a sample code to add peer-to-peer messaging into your app by using the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat UIKit.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of how clients send and receive peer-to-peer messages:

![1643335864426](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1643335864426)

1. Clients retrieve a token from your app server.
2. Client A and Client B log in to <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat.
3. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat server, and the server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives the message, the SDK triggers an event. Client B listens for the event and gets the message.
