This guide explains how pricing works for the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service.

<Admonition type="info">
If you have a signed contract with <Vg k="COMPANY" />, your contract terms take precedence over the pricing information in this document.
</Admonition>

## Service Workflow

Here's how the Cloud Transcoding Service works:

1. **Stream Publishing:** Users publish audio/video streams through <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SD-RTN.
2. **Stream Subscription:** <Vg k="COMPANY" /> transcoding servers subscribe to streams
3. **Processing:** <Vg k="COMPANY" /> transcodes (converts) or passes-through streams as needed
4. **Distribution:** The processed stream is delivered to chosen destinations (RTC channels or CDN)

You are charged for steps 2 (subscription) and 3 (processing).

## How billing works

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your monthly usage across all projects in your developer account and issues bills accordingly. The <Vpd k="NAME" /> charges consist of two components:

| Fee Type | What It Covers | Free Tier | Calculation |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Subscription Fees** | The duration when <Vg k="COMPANY" /> service subscribes to audio and video streams | Included in monthly 10,000 minutes of free real-time audio and video usage | Based on the actual duration of audio and video streams processed |
| **Transcoding Fees** | The computational cost of processing and converting streams | These fees are separate from the 10,000 minutes free tier | Based on the type and duration of transcoding performed |


## Pricing Breakdown

### Subscription Fees

When transcoding starts, the service joins channels as a virtual participant to access streams. This follows the same pricing structure as <Vg k="COMPANY" /> real-time audio and video services.

- Audio Subscription Fee = Audio unit price × Audio duration  
- Video Subscription Fee = Video unit price × Video duration

<Admonition type="info"> 
If dual-stream mode is used, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> only subscribes to the main video stream for cost efficiency.
</Admonition>

### Transcoding Fees

Transcoding fees vary based on the type of processing required:

**Audio Transcoding**
When outputting audio streams, audio transcoding fees apply. It is calculated as follows:

`Audio transcoding duration × Audio transcoding unit price`

**Video Processing**

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers two types of video processing:

- Video pass-through (No Transcoding)  
    When video is output without format conversion, video pass-through fees apply. It is calculated as follows:

    `Video duration × Video non-transcoding unit price`

- Video Transcoding  
    When video format conversion is required, video transcoding fees apply. It is calculated as follows:

    `Video transcoding duration × Video transcoding unit price`

## Pricing tables

The following tables show the applicable rates for video processing

### Video pass-through (No Transcoding)

| Category | Pricing ($US/1,000 minutes) |
|:---------|:--------------------------:|
| Audio streams | 1.99 |

| Category | Pricing ($US/1,000 minutes) |
|:---------|:--------------------------:|
| Video stream - HD | 7.99 |
| Video stream - Full HD | 15.99 |

Video resolutions are defined as follows:

| Resolution type | Range |

| Full High-Definition (Full HD) | From greater than 921,600 pixels (1280 × 720) to 2,073,600 pixels (1920 × 1080) |


## Duration Calculation

- **Monitoring:** <Vg k="COMPANY" /> tracks the exact start and stop times of each transcoding task
- **Precision:** Calculated in seconds for accuracy
- **Billing:** Displayed in seconds in your console, rounded to minutes on invoices
- **Minimum charge:** Partial seconds/minutes are rounded up to the next full unit
