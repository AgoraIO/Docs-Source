Media stream encryption refers to encrypting audio and video streams in an app through a unique [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) controlled by the app developer. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides media stream encryption functionality to ensure the confidentiality of data during transmission, and it is recommended to apply it appropriately according to the actual business scenario.

This article describes how to integrate <Vg k="COMPANY" /> built-in media stream encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

The diagram illustrates the process of data transfer with the encryption of media streams enabled. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommonds to utilize the encryption mode, while also configuring both the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) parameters. The recommended encryption standards are `AES_128_GCM2` and `AES_256_GCM2`.
