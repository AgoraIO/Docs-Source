#### User ID

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="signaling">

In <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s platform, the UID is an integer value that is a unique identifier assigned to each user within the context of a specific channel. When joining a channel, you have the choice to either assign a specific UID to the user or pass null and allow <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s platform to automatically generate and assign a UID for the user. If two users attempt to join the same channel with the same UID, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

The UID is used by <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s services and components to identify and manage users within a channel. Developers should ensure that UIDs are properly assigned to prevent conflicts.

In <Vg k="MESS" />, the UID is a string that is a unique identifier and required along with an App ID to initialize the SDK. It is used to identify the user when logging in to <Vg k="MESS" /> and throughout their session. Users can join channels by providing just the channel name, as the UID is already associated with the user during initialization.

The same UID cannot log in to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> from multiple devices at the same time. If <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>s with the same UID logs in to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, the <Vplk="CLIENT" /> previously logged in client is disconnected and sent an event notification.

The UID is used for billing and online status notifications.
