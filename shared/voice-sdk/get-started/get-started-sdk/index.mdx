This page provides a step-by-step guide on seamlessly integrating the <Vpd k="SDK"/> and effortlessly building a basic, real-time interactive <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> from scratch using minimal code.

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">

## Understand the tech

This section explains how you can integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Following are some basic concepts about real-time audio interaction:

- **<Vg k="ASDK"/>**: An SDK developed by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to enable developers to add real-time audio interaction to their projects.
- **Channel**: A channel is used to transmit data. Users in the same channel can interact in real time.
- **Host**: A host can publish audio in a channel. The host can also subscribe to audio published by other hosts.
- **Audience**: A user assigned the audience role may subscribe to audio within the channel. However, they are not authorized to publish content.

For more information, see [Core Concepts](../overview/core-concepts).

The following figure shows the basic workflow you implement to integrate this feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites
<Prerequisites/>
- The following information from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>:
    - **App ID**: A unique string generated by Agora that identifies your project.
    - **A temporary token**: A dynamic key that authenticates a user when the client joins a channel. Note down the channel name you use to generate the token.
        
        <Admonition type="info" title="information">The maximum validity period of a temporary token is 24 hours.</Admonition>

    Please refer to [Agora account management](../get-started/manage-agora-account) for details.
