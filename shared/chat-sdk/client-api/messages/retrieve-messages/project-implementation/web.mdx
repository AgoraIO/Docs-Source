### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getServerConversations` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

<div class="alert note">Do not use mixed upper-case.</div>

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is `20`.
// cursor: The cursor position for starting to get data. If you pass in an empty string (''), the SDK retrieves conversations from the latest active one.
connection.getServerConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''}).then((res)=>{
    console.log(res)
})
```

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, by default, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, and this number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

After the GA release of Agora Chat 1.3, you can log in to Agora Console and enable the chatroom message history retrieval feature. After that, Agora Chat servers will stop automatically pushing chatroom messages to new members and you can follow the guidance below to retrieve chatroom message history.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

We recommend that you retrieve 20 messages each time, with a maximum of 50. During paginated query, if the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the number of `pageSize`, the number of messages of `pageSize` will be returned. If it is less than the number of `pageSize`, the actual number will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the number of `pageSize`.

Refer to the following code sample:

```javascript
connection.getHistoryMessages({
  targetId: 'targetId', // The user ID of the peer user for one-to-one chat or group ID for group chat.
  chatType: 'groupChat', // The chat type: `singleChat` for one-to-one chat or `groupChat` for group chat.
  pageSize: 20, // The number of messages to retrieve per page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is 20.
  searchDirection: 'down', // The message search direction: `up` means to retrieve messages in the descending order of the message timestamp and `down` means to retrieve messages in the ascending order of the message timestamp.
  searchOptions: {
    from: 'message sender userID', // The user ID of the message sender. This parameter is used only for group chat.
    msgTypes: ['txt'], // An array of message types for query. If no value is passed in, all types of message will be queried.
    startTime: new Date('2023,11,9').getTime(), // The start timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
    endTime: new Date('2023,11,10').getTime(), // The end timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
  },
});
```

### Pin a conversation

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```javascript
connection.pinConversation({conversationId:'conversationId', conversationType: 'singleChat', isPinned: true})
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50]。
// cursor：The cursor position to start getting data. If an empty string ('') is passed, the SDK will start querying from the latest pinned session.
connection.getServerPinnedConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''})
```

### Pin a message

You can call `pinMessage` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `PinnedMessageInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Message ID.
   messageId: 'messageId'
}

conn.pinMessage(options).then(()=>{
   // Succeeded in pinning the message.
   console.log('Succeeded in pinning the message')
})

```

### Unpin a message

You can call `unpinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Message ID.
   messageId: 'messageId'
}

conn.unpinMessage(options).then(()=>{
   // Succeeded in unpinning the message.
   console.log('Succeeded in unpinning the message.')
})

```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `getServerPinnedMessages` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note"><ul><li>If a message expires on the server or the user deletes it unilaterally from the server after pinning, such user will not be able to pull it when pulling roaming messages. However, this user and other users will be able to pull this message from the pinned message list.</li><li>If the user withdraws a message after pinning, the message will be removed from the server; other users will not be able to pull it when they pull the pinned message list from the server.</li></ul></Admonition>

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // The number of pinned messages to retrieve per page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is `10`
   pageSize: 20,
   // The cursor position that indicates where to start getting data.
   // Pass in an empty string ('') for the first call of the API and the SDK returns the pinned messages in the descending order of the pinning time.
   cursor: ''
}

conn.getServerPinnedMessages(options).then((res)=>{
   // Succeeded in retrieving the list of pinned messages in a conversation.
   console.log(res)
})
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeHistoryMessages` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 20 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```javascript
// Delete messages by timestamp
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', beforeTimeStamp: Date.now()})
// Delete messages by message ID
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', messageIds: ['messageId']})
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

You can use the `removeHistoryMessages` method to unidirectionally delete historical messages on the server based on time or message ID. Up to 20 messages can be deleted at once. After deletion, the account cannot retrieve the message from the server. Other users are not affected by this operation.

Upon successful deletion, the `deleteRoaming` callback will be triggered when logging in from multiple terminals and devices.

```javascript
// Delete messages by time stamp
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', beforeTimeStamp: Date.now()})

// Delete messages by message ID
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', messageIds: ['messageId']})
```
### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addConversationMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. Each conversation can have up to 20 tags. This feature applies only to private chats and chat groups.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `getServerConversations` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `ConversationItem#marks` method.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations per user), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.addConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('addConversationMark success')
})
```

To create customized tags, you need to do the following:
  
  ```javascript
  const MarkMap = new Map();
  MarkMap.set(0, 'IMPORTANT');
  MarkMap.set(1, 'NORMAL');
  MarkMap.set(2, 'STAR');
  ```

### Remove conversation tag

To remove a conversation tag, call `removeConversationMark`. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side conversation tags.

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.removeConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('removeConversationMark success')
})
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `getServerConversationsByFilter` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (For an unpinned conversation, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```javascript
const options = {
  pageSize: 10,
  cursor: '',
  filter: {
    mark: 0
  }
}
conn.getServerConversationsByFilter().then((res) => {
  console.log('getServerConversationsByFilter success', res)
})
```
