### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerByPage` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. Each retrieved conversation contains one last historical message. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
This retrieves up to 100 conversations per API call by default. Contact support@agora.io if you want to adjust this limit.

```objective-c
// pageNum: The current page number, starting from 1.
// pageSize: The number of conversations to get per page. The value range is [1,20].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerByPage:pageNum pageSize:pageSize completion:^(NSArray<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable aConversations, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

}];
```

For users that do not support `getConversationsFromServerByPage`, call `getConversationsFromServer` method to retrieve the conversations from the server, the SDK, by default, retrieves the last ten conversations in the past seven days, and each conversation contains one last historical message. To adjust the time limit or the number of conversations retrieved, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages by pagination from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

```objective-c
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager asyncFetchHistoryMessagesFromServer:conversation.conversationId conversationType:conversation.type startMessageId:@"startMsgId" pageSize:10 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatMessage *> * _Nullable aResult, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {
        [conversation loadMessagesStartFromId:@"startMsgId" count:10 searchDirection:AgoraChatMessageSearchDirectionUp completion:nil];
    }];
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```objective-c
// Delete messages by timestamp
AgoraChatConversation* conversation = [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId"];
    [conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:timeToRemove completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
// Delete messages by message ID
 [conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"msgId1",@"msgId2"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages from the server. After the conversations are deleted from the server, you and other users can no longer get them from the server. If the historical messages are deleted with the conversations, all users can no longer get the messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```
