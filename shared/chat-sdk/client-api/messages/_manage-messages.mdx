In chat apps, a conversation is composed of all the messages in a peer-to-peer chat, chat group, or chatroom. The Chat SDK supports managing messages by conversations, including retrieving and managing unread messages, deleting the historical messages on the local device, and searching historical messages.

This page introduces how to use the Chat SDK to implement these functionalities.

<PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
After a user sends a message to another chat user or chat group, this user expects to know whether the message is delievered or read. The Chat SDK provides the message receipt feature, which enables you to send a receipt to the message sender once the message is delievered or read.

This page introduces how to use the Chat SDK to implement message receipt functionalities in one-to-one chats and chat groups.
