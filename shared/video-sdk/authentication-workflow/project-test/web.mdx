3.  In **src/agora_manager/config.json**, update `appID`, `channelName` and `token` with your values.

4.  Start the proxy server

    For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. To make requests to your token server, this sample app uses the [NodeJS corsAnywhere proxy](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) which adds [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to the proxied requests. To start this server:
        1. In a new Terminal, navigate to `/src`
        1. Run the following command:
    
        ```bash
        node proxy
        ```

5.  Start the dev server

      Execute the following command in the terminal:

      ```bash
      pnpm dev
      ```

      Use the URL displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> in your browser.
