The logic for implementing the message delivery and read receipts are as follows:

- Message delivery receipts

  1. The message sender enables delivery receipts by setting `options.delivery` as `true` when creating the `connection` object.
  2. After the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically sends a delivery receipt to the sender.
  3. The sender receives the delivery receipt by listening for `onDeliveredMessage`.

- Conversation and message read receipts

  1. After reading the message, the recipient calls `send` to send a conversation or message read receipt.
  2. The sender receives the conversation or message receipt by listening for `onReadMessage`.
