This page shows you how to implement two advanced beauty features: beauty and makeup.

<PlatformWrapper platform={['android','ios','macos','windows']}>

## Understand the technology

The <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the `setBeautyEffectOptions` method for implementing basic beauty effects, such as whitening and skin smoothing.

Starting in v4.5.0, the SDK includes the following advanced beauty features:

- **Beautification**: Modify specific facial features using presets that simulate effects like a slimmer face, larger eyes, or a thinner nose. You can also fine-tune each feature for more detailed effects.
- **Makeup**: Apply cosmetic effects such as eye shadow, colored contact lenses, eyelashes, eyebrows, lip gloss, and blush.

<Admonition>
<Vg k="RTEE_BEAUTY" /> is currently free for a limited time. In the future, it may become a value-added service with separate billing. For details, see [Pricing](/video-calling/overview/pricing).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before you implement advanced beauty features, make sure that:

- You are using <Vpd k="SDK" /> v4.5.0 or later.
- Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has implemented the basic real-time audio and video functionality and has permission to access the necessary devices. See the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk).
- You have integrated the video enhancement dynamic library. If you remove this library, advanced beauty features won't work.
- To enable beauty features, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to obtain the required resources.
