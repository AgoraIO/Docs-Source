### Equipment quality test

The SDK provides the `startEchoTest` method to test the network connection and whether the audio and video devices are working properly. Refer to the following steps to implement the device quality test:

1. Before joining a channel, call `startEchoTest`. Specify the `intervalInSeconds` parameter to set the delay time for the echo test. The value range is 2-10 seconds and the default value is 10.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The user's audio is played back after a short delay. If the playback is normal, it means that the user's devices and upstream and downstream network are working normally. 

1. To stop the test, call `stopEchoTest`, and then call `joinChannelByToken` to join a channel.

To implement running an echo test in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` cpp
// Start the echo test
// Only the host can call startEchoTest
rtcEngine.startEchoTest(10);

// Wait and check if you can hear your own voice played back

// Stop the echo test
// You must call stopEchoTest to end the echo test. Otherwise, you will not be able to do another echo test or join the channel
rtcEngine.stopEchoTest
```

#### Audio recording device test

To test whether a local audio recording device, such as a microphone, is working properly, refer to the following steps.

1. Call `startRecordingDeviceTest` and set the `indicationInterval` parameter to the time interval after which the callback is triggered.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The SDK reports `uid = 0`, and the volume information of the device in the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback.

1. When you are done testing, call `stopRecordingDeviceTest` to stop the test.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
Best practice is to set the `indicationInterval` parameter to more than `200` milliseconds and not less than `10` milliseconds, otherwise the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback may not be received.
</Admonition>

To implement running a recording device test in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` cpp
// Select an audio capture device
lpDeviceManager->setRecordingDevice(strDeviceID);

// Implement the audio volume callback 
virtual void onAudioVolumeIndication(const AudioVolumeInfo* speakers, unsigned int speakerNumber, int totalVolume) {
        (void)speakers;
        (void)speakerNumber;
        (void)totalVolume;
    }

// Start audio capture device test
(*lpDeviceManager)->startRecordingDeviceTest(1000);

// Stop the audio capture device test
(*lpDeviceManager)->stopRecordingDeviceTest();
```

#### Audio playback device test

To test that the local audio playback device is working properly, refer to the following steps:

1. Call `startPlaybackDeviceTest` and set the `audioFileName` parameter to the absolute path of the audio file to be played.

1. If the user hears the audio, the playback device is working properly. The SDK triggers the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to report `uid = 1` and the volume information of the playback device.

1. When you are done testing, call `stopPlaybackDeviceTest` to stop the test.

To implement running a playback device test in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` cpp
// Select an audio playback device
lpDeviceManager->setPlaybackDevice(strDeviceID);

// Specify the absolute path of the audio file to start the playback device test
(*lpDeviceManager)->startPlaybackDeviceTest(filePath);

// Stop the audio playback device test
(*lpDeviceManager)->stopPlaybackDeviceTest();
```

#### Audio device loopback test

To test if the local audio device loop is working properly, refer to the following steps:

1. Call `startAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` and set the `indicationInterval` parameter to the time interval after which the callback is triggered.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The microphone captures the sound and then plays it on the playback device. The SDK returns two `onAudioVolumeIndication` callbacks to report the volume information of the audio capture device with `uid= 0`, and the audio playback device with `uid= 1`, respectively.

1. When you are done testing, call `stopAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` to stop the recording device test.

Best practice is to set the `indicationInterval` parameter to more than `200` milliseconds and not less than `10` milliseconds, otherwise the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback may not be received.

### Network quality analysis

The SDK provides the `startLastmileProbeTest` method to probe the last-mile network quality before joining a channel. The method returns information about the network quality score and network statistics. Take the following steps to run a last-mile network quality probe test:

1. Before joining a channel or switching user roles, call `startLastmileProbeTest` to start the network test. Set the probe configuration and the expected maximum bitrate in `LastmileProbeConfig`.

1. After you start the test, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
    
    - `onLastmileQuality`: This callback is triggered two seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It provides feedback on the upstream and downstream network quality through a subjective `quality` score.

    - `onLastmileProbeResult`: This callback is triggered 30 seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It returns objective real-time network statistics, including `packetLossRate`, network `jitter`, and `availableBandwidth`.

1. Call `stopLastmileProbeTest` to stop last-mile network testing.

To implement network quality testing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` cpp
// Register the callback interface
// This callback occurs approximately 2 seconds after starting Last-mile network probe test
void onLastmileQuality(int quality) {
}

// This callback occurs approximately 30 seconds after starting Last-mile network probe test
void onLastmileProbeResult(LastmileProbeResult) {
    // (1) Optionally, you can end the test inside the callback. Agora recommends not calling other API methods until the testing is completed
    lpAgoraEngine->stopLastmileProbeTest();
}

// Configure a LastmileProbeConfig instance
LastmileProbeConfig config;
// Enable detection of uplink network quality
config.probeUplink = true;
// Enable detection of downlink network quality
config.probeDownlink = true;
// Desired maximum transmit bitrate in bps, range [100000,5000000].
config.expectedUplinkBitrate = 100000;
// Desired maximum receive bitrate in bps, range [100000,5000000].
config.expectedDownlinkBitrate = 100000;
// Start last-mile network probing before joining a channel.
lpAgoraEngine->startLastmileProbeTest(config);

// (2) You can also choose to end the test at another time. Agora does not recommend calling any other API methods until testing is complete.
lpAgoraEngine->stopLastmileProbeTest();
```
