- **Message channel**

    In a message channel, a publisher simply delivers a message to a specific channel, and any device or user subscribed to that channel receives that message or event notification. See [Message channels](../core-functionality/message-channel) for implementation details.

- **Stream channel**

    In a stream channel, users call the <code>{props.joinTopic}</code> method to register as a publisher of a topic before they can send messages. To receive messages from a publisher in a given topic, a user subscribes to a specific message publisher, identified by their user ID. See [Stream channels](../core-functionality/stream-channel) for implementation details.

The channel types are distinguished in the API by <code>{props.channelType}</code>. Apart from the message sending and receiving mechanism, the features and use of message channels and stream channels for notification of other events such as `Presence`, `Storage`, and `Locks`, is the same. The following table summarizes the main characteristics and applicable scenarios for the channel types:

|Channel type |Main characteristics |Applicable scenarios |
|:------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|
|Message      |Message channels use the industry-standard pub/sub (publish/subscribe) model to deliver messages and events. These channels do not need to be created in advance and are available on demand. There is no limit on the number of publishers and subscribers in a channel, but there is a limit on the upstream queries per second (QPS) for a single channel. | Common applications include scenarios based on the pub/sub model and multi-device applications, such as multi-device management and command sending/receiving in location tracking, the IoT industry, smart devices, and large communities. |
|Stream       |Stream channels are based on the room concept, which is similar to the observer pattern in the industry. Users join a channel to send messages and receive event notifications. Messages are managed and delivered using topics within a channel. A single channel allows up to 1000 users to join at the same time. Message channels support co-channel and synchronous transmission of audio and video data. In addition, they support client-side message delivery with higher QPS. | High-frequency and high-concurrency data transmission scenarios, as well as scenarios where audio and video data are synchronously transmitted in the same channel. Examples include Metaverse applications, parallel driving, and cloud gaming. |
