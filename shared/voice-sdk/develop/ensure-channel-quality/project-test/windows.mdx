6. **Initialization best practice**

    When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> initializes the <Vg k="ENGINE" />, it does the following:

    * Sets the log file location, size, and logging level according to your preference.
    * Enables the dual-stream mode.
    * Sets the audio profile.
    * Sets the video profile.
    * Starts a network probe test.
    
    You see the result of the network probe test displayed in the network status icon.

7. **Run the echo test**

    1. Press **Start Echo Test**. You see the local camera feed. 
    
    1. Speak into the device microphone. You hear the recorded audio after a short delay. 
    
        This test confirms that the user's hardware is working properly.

    1. Press **Stop Echo Test** to end the test.

8. **Join a channel**

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
    Select an option and click **Join** to start a session. When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="interactive-live-streaming">
    Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.
    </ProductWrapper>

9. **Monitor network health**

    You see the network status indicator updated periodically based on the result of the `onNetworkQuality` callback.

10. **View connection statistics**

    After joining a channel, you receive toast messages informing you of some selected call statistics, including: 

    * The number of users in the channel
    * Packet loss rate
    * Remote video state changes 

11. **Test the dual steam functionality**

    Tap on a remote video in one of the smaller frames. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> moves the video to the larger frame and switches video quality to high. Tap on another video in a small frame. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> moves the video in the larger frame back to a smaller frame and switches back to the low quality stream.

12. **View remote video statistics**

    When a remote video is displayed in the larger frame, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> overlays the video with some selected stats for that video.
