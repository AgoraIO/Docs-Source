By default, the SDK generates three log files, `easemob.log` and two `easemob_Y-m-d_H-M-S.log` files, each with a maximum size of 2048 KB (2 MB). These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest logs in `easemob.log`. When `easemob.log` is full, the SDK renames it to the name of the current time-dependent log file. If there are more than three log files, the SDK deletes the earliest log file, and creates a new `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

For example, the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record logs at 8:00:00 a.m. on January 1, 2024. If this file is completely written at 8:30:00 a.m., the SDK renames it `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log`. At 9:30:00 a.m. and 10:30:30 a.m., the SDK generates `easemob_2024-01-01_09-30-30.log` and `easemob_2024-01-01_10-30-30.log`. At this time, `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log` will be removed before the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

In debugging mode, the SDK outputs all types of logs, including debugging information, warnings, and errors. By default, the SDK only outputs error logs. Therefore, to output all logs, enable the debugging mode.

```csharp
Options options = new Options(appkey);
options.AutoLogin = false;
options.UsingHttpsOnly = true;
options.DebugMode = true;
SDKClient.Instance.InitWithOptions(options);
```

## Collect SDK logs

- Unity Mac

    The log path is `/Users/XXX/Library/Application Support/YYY/ZZZ/sdkdata/easemobLog` or `/Users/XXX/Library/Application Support/com.YYY.ZZZ/sdkdata/easemobLog`.

    1. `XXX` indicates the Mac username.
    2. `YYY` indicates the company name, which is `DefaultCompany` by default.
    3. `ZZZ` indicates the app name.

- Unity Windows

    The log path is `C:\Users\XXX\AppData\LocalLow\YYY\ZZZ\sdkdata\easemobLog`.

    1. `XXX` indicates the Windows username.
    2. `YYY` indicates the company name set in Unity, which is `DefaultCompany` by default.
    3. `ZZZ` indicates the app name.

- Unity iOS

    The local logs are obtained in the same way as the iOS platform.

    Here, a simulator is used as an example.

    To access SDK logs, take the following steps:

    1. Copy the app sandbox path printed by `NSHomeDirectory()`.
    2. In the Finder on your Mac system, select **Go > Go to Folder**.
    3. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste the path and press **Return**.
    4. Open the logs directory `{app sandbox path}/Library/Application Support/HyphenateSDK/easemobLog/` which contains the SDK logs.

- Unity Android

    In Android Studio, you can choose **View** > **Tool Windows** > **Device File Explorer** and check the log folder on your device by accessing `/data/data/<your_package_name>/sdkdata/easemobLog`.
