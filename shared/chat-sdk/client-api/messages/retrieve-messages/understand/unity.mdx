The Chat SDK uses `IChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. The following are the core methods:

- `GetConversationsFromServerWithPage`: Retrieve conversations stored on the server with pagination.
- `FetchHistoryMessagesFromServer`: Retrieve the historical messages in the specified conversation from the server.
- `RemoveMessagesFromServer`: Deletes historical messages from the server unidirectionally.
- `DeleteConversationFromServer`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.
