1. Generate a user token  
In this guide, <Vpd k="NAME" /> uses temporary tokens generated from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for authentication. In a production context, the best practice is for you to deploy your own token server, use your own [App Key](enable#get-chat-project-information) to generate a token, and retrieve the token on the client side to log in to <Vpd k="NAME" />. To see how to implement a server that serves tokens on request, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../Develop/Authentication).

2. Avoid blocked callbacks  
Each callback of a <Vpd k="NAME" /> client instance is triggered from internal threads. To avoid blocking internal threads, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends that you execute your operations in other threads when callbacks are triggered.
