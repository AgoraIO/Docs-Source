### Clone the Repository

Agora provides the [agora-live repository](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/agora-live) to demonstrate how to integrate and use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> for live streaming scenarios. To clone the repository locally, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/agora-live.git
```

### Integrate the FaceUnity extension

FaceUnity is a third-party extension. To integrate FaceUnity functionality in the <Vg k="SOL_LIVE" /> project:

1. Download the **Demo** file from the [Extensions Marketplace](https://console.agora.io/marketplace/extension/introduce?serviceName=faceunity-ar-en).

1. Copy the `authpack.java` file to the `/scenes/show/src/main/java/io/agora/scene/show/beauty/` folder in the agora-live project. 

1. Change the package name to `package io.agora.scene.show.beauty;` in the agora-live project.

    ![Gradel Properties](/images/solutions/live/gradle_properties.png)

1. Set the <Vg k="VSDK" /> and Media Pull parameters as follows:

    ```
    # Project-wide Gradle settings.
    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
    android.injected.testOnly=false
    android.useAndroidX=true
    # Automatically convert third-party libraries to use AndroidX
    android.enableJetifier=true
    # application build version code
    APP_VERSION_CODE=1
    # application version name
    APP_VERSION_NAME=0.1.0
    
    #----------- Server Host Config --------------
    TOOLBOX_SERVER_HOST=https://toolbox-overseas-prod.sg3.agoralab.co
