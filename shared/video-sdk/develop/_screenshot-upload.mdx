To meet the needs of video content supervision, Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to take screenshots of the
video stream in a channel and then upload these images to third-party cloud storage.

## Understand the tech

When you enable screenshot upload, you set the interval between screenshots. After each interval <Vg k="VSDK" />
takes a screenshot of the video stream sent by local users, and uploads the image to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. <Vg
k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uploads each screenshot to your third-party cloud storage and sends a callback notification to
your server in the form of an `HTTPS` request.

        - **Region**: The geographical location of the data center where the storage is located.
        - **Access key**: The key used to authenticate and access the storage service.
        - **Secret key**: A secure key paired with the access key for secure access.
        - **Bucket name**: Name of the bucket for storing files within the storage service.
        - **Endpoint**: The URL to access the storage service.

### Video screenshot upload dynamic library

For details about the Video screenshot upload dynamic library and the increase in size of the integrated app for each architecture, see [App size optimization](../reference/downloads#plugin-list).

### HTTP message notification

After a screenshot is successfully uploaded to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, the Agora service sends a message notification callback to your application server in the form of an `HTTPS POST` request. The data format is `JSON`, and the character encoding is `UTF-8`.

After receiving a message notification, your application server responds with a status code of `200`. The response packet body format is `JSON`. Agora considers the notification to have failed under any of the following circumstances:

* The Agora service does not receive a response from your server within 5 seconds after sending the message notification.

* The HTTP status code of the response is not `200`, or the response body format is not `JSON`.

The Agora service retries immediately after the first notification failure, and sends a message notification again. It makes a total of three notification attempts.

### HTTP Request

#### Request header

| Field name | value |
|:-----|:-------------|
