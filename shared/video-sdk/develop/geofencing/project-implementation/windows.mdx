<PlatformWrapper platform="windows">

To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, set the [AREA_CODE](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/4.x/API/enum_areacode.html) property of [RtcEngineContext](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/cpp/4.x/API/class_rtcengineconfig.html) to a region for geofencing. In `AgoraImplementationDlg.cpp`, locate the `setupVideoSDKEngine` method and add the following code before `agoraEngine->initialize(context);`:
```cpp
// Your app will only connect to Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
context.areaCode = AREA_CODE_NA;
```
If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

* Whitelist certain domains
* Allow all IP addresses
* Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to= "../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>
