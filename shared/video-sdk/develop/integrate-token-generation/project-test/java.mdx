1.  In the sample code, set the variables `appId`, and `appCertificate` to values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1.  Set `channelName` and `expirationTimeInSeconds` to the name of the channel to join and the renew time for the token.

1.  For the purpose of this test, set `uid` equal to zero.

1.  Build and run the project

    The code generates a <Vpd k="NAME"/> token using an integer `uid` and prints it to the terminal. 

1.  Use the token to connect to a <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel

    1.  In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link>.

    1.  Fill in the *App ID*, and *Channel* with the same values that were used to call the token generation method.

    1.  Copy the <Vpd k="NAME"/> uid authentication token from the terminal and paste it into the **Token** box.
