|  Feature  |  Example |
| ---- | ---- |
| Blurred background and image background   |   ![](/images/extensions-marketplace/blurred-background.jpg)   |
| Video/Animated background   |   <video src={videoURL} poster="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1654571689670"  controls width="100%" height="auto">Your browser does not support the <code>video</code>  element.</video>   |
| Portrait-in-picture   | ![portrait-in-picture](/images/extensions-marketplace/portrait-in-picture.jpg) Allows the presenter to use slides as the virtual background while superimposing their video. The effect is similar to a weather news cast on television, preventing interruptions during a layout toggle.   |
