1. **Join a channel**

    In your app, the user should join the RTC channel using a different user ID than the agent while using the same token and channel name.

    <Admonition info="info" type="info">
    You can also join the RTC channel via the [Web demo app](https://webdemo-global.agora.io/index.html). After completing the initialization settings, select **Quick Start - Audio and Video Call** from the left menu. Enter a different user ID from the agent and use the same token and channel name to join the RTC channel.

1. **Join a channel with agent**

    To start the agent, run the following command in your project directory:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers>
    {`go run main.go`}
    </CodeBlock>

    After successful execution, you will see the following log output:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers>
    {`DEBUG agora-rest-client-go 2025/03/20 07:20:34 client.go:148: http response:{"agent_id":"1NT29X0XEAxxxxxxPHSDRNZYF","create_ts":1742455234,"status":"RUNNING"}
    2025/03/20 15:20:34 main.go:103: Join success:&{Response:{BaseResponse:0xc0002169c0 ErrResponse:{Detail: Reason:}} SuccessResp:{AgentId:1NT29X0XEAxxxxxxPHSDRNZYF CreateTs:1742455234 Status:RUNNING}}
    2025/03/20 15:20:34 main.go:111: agentId:1NT29X0XEAxxxxxxPHSDRNZYF
    `}
    </CodeBlock>

    After the agent successfully joins the RTC channel, it will send a greeting to the user.

    <Admonition type="info" info="info">
    If the agent joins the RTC channel and no other users are present, the agent will automatically leave the channel after a predefined period (120 seconds in the sample code).
    </Admonition>

1. **Interact with the agent**

    Once both the user and the agent have joined the channel, the user can interact with the agent directly. The agent will respond to the user using voice.
