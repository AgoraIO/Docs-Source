### Subscribe to the presence status of one or more users

By default, you do not subscribe to any users. To subscribe to the presence statuses of the specified users, you can call `subscribe`. Whenever the specified users update their presence statuses, the `onPresenceStatusChanged` callback is triggered, notifying you about the updated statuses asynchronously.

The following code sample shows how to subscribe to the presence status of one or more users:

```dart
// members: The ID list of users to whom you subscribe.
List<String> members = [];
// expiry: The subscription duration in seconds.
int expiry = 100;
try {
  List<ChatPresence> list =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.subscribe(
    members: members,
    expiry: expiry,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

<div class="alert info"><ol><li>You can subscribe to a maximum of 100 users at each call. The total subscriptions of each user cannot exceed 3,000. Once the number of subscriptions exceed the limit, the subsequent subscriptions with longer durations succeed and replace the existing subscriptions with shorter durations.</li><li>The subscription duration can be a maximum of 30 days. When the subscription to a user expires, you need to subscribe to this user once again. If you subscribe to a user again before the current subscription expires, the duration is reset.</li></ol></div>


### Publish a custom presence status

You can call `publishPresence` to to publish a custom status. Whenever your presence status updates, the users who subscribe to you receive the `ChatPresenceEventHandler#onPresenceStatusChanged` callback.

The following code sample shows how to publish a custom status:

```dart
try {
  // description: The custom presence status.
  await ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.publishPresence(description);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```


### Listen for presence status updates

Refer to the following code sample to listen for presence status updates:

```dart
    // Adds the presence event handler.
    ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.addEventHandler(
      "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
      ChatPresenceEventHandler(
        onPresenceStatusChanged: (list) {},
      ),
    );

    ...

    // Removes the presence event handler.
    ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.removeEventHandler("UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID");
```

### Unsubscribe from the presence status of one or more users

You can call `unSubscribe` to unsubscribe from the presence statuses of the specified users, as shown in the following code sample:

```dart
// memberIds: The ID list of users from whom you unsubscribe.
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.unSubscribe(
    members: members,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Retrieve the list of subscriptions


You can call `fetchSubscribedMembers` to retrieve the list of your subscriptions in a paginated list, as shown in the following code sample:

```dart
try {
  List<String> subMembers =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager.fetchSubscribedMembers();
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Retrieve the presence status of one or more users

You can call `fetchPresenceStatus` to retrieve the current presence statuses of the specified users without the need to subscribe to them, as shown in the following code sample:

```dart
// memberIds: The ID list of users whose presence statuses you retrieve.
try {
  List<ChatPresence> list = await ChatClient.getInstance.presenceManager
      .fetchPresenceStatus(members: memberIds);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```
