- Agent response handling

## Prerequisites

Before running the demo:  
- Complete the [Agent quickstart](../get-started/quickstart)
- Ensure Docker is running on your system
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) if you want to run from source code

## Run from Docker image

1. Follow the [Agent quickstart](../get-started/quickstart) to set up the environment

1. Switch to the demo configuration:
    
    ```bash
    task use AGENT=agents/examples/demo
    ```

1. Start the web server:

    ```bash
    task run
    ```

1. Access the demo at `http://localhost:3002`

## Run from source code

To run the demo from source code:

1. Open a new terminal in the TEN-Agent project directory

1. Navigate to the demo folder:
