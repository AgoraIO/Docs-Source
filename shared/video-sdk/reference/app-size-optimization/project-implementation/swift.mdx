#### Remove plugins when CocoaPods is integrated

When integrating the iOS/macOS SDK through CocoaPods, you can use the `subspecs` field to specify the dynamic library you need to integrate, so as to exclude the plugins you don't need to use. See the subspecs field for details about the correspondence between the dynamic library and the `subspecs` field .

Example 1: When integrating the iOS Video SDK version 4.0.1 and using all plugins, the Podfile is as follows:

```perl
# platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1'
end
```

Example 2: When integrating the iOS Video SDK version 4.0.1 and not using all plugins, the Podfile is as follows:

```perl
# platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic']
end
```

Example 3: When integrating the 4.0.1 version of the iOS Video SDK and only need to use the AI ​​noise reduction plug-in and the Bel Canto plug-in in the plug-in list, the Podfile is as follows:

```perl
# platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic', 'AINS', 'AudioBeauty']
end
```

When filling in the above pod command, please make sure that the SDK version you specified has the plugin you specified, and the `subspecs` field is correct, otherwise pod installation error will be reported when . For example, `pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.0', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic', 'AgoraRtcAINS']` when `pod install` an error will be reported.
