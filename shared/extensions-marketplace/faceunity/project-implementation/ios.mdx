1. **Enable the extension**

    When initializing `AgoraRtcEngineKit`, call `enableExtensionWithVendor` before other APIs (including `enableVideo` and `joinChannelByToken`) to enable the extension.

    ```objective-c
    [self.agoraKit enableExtensionWithVendor:@"FaceUnity"
                                extension:@"Effect"
                                    enabled:self.enable];
    ```

1. **Initialize the extension**

    After receiving the `onExtensionStarted` callback, call `setExtensionPropertyWithVendor`, and pass in the corresponding keys and values:

    1. Initialize the extension
    Set the key as `fuSetup`, and the value as the pointer to the certificate file.
    2. Load the AI model
    Set the key as `fuLoadAIModelFromPackage`, and the value contains the path of the AI capability model file `ai_xxx.bundle` and the AI capability type.

1. **Configure beauty effects and body recognition**

    Call `setExtensionPropertyWithVendor` (iOS) and pass in the corresponding keys and values.

    You can implement the following functions:
    - Load props and adjust beautification intensity
    - Recognize and track human faces, gestures, and bodies

    You can call the method as needed. For a full list of keys and values, see the [API Reference](#faceunity-key-value-overview).

1. **Release the resources**

    When you do not need the extension, follow these steps to release the resources:

    1. Call `setExtensionPropertyWithVendor` and pass in the key as `fuDestroyLibData`.
    2. After receiving the `fuDestroyLibData` callback, call `destroy` to destroy `AgoraRtcEngineKit`.
