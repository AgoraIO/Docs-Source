  Develop TEN Agent in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces.
---

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment for <Vpd k="NAME" />. It enables you to develop directly in your browser wit the following benefits: 

- No local environment setup required
- Consistent development environment across devices
- Works on any computer with a browser
- Pre-configured with all dependencies

This guide shows you how to get started with <Vpd k="NAME" /> in Codespaces.

## Implementation

### Create a Codespace

1. Navigate to the [TEN-framework repository](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework)

2. Click the **Code** button and select **Create codespace on main**

    ![Open with Codespaces](/images/ten-agent/start_codespace.png)

3. GitHub creates your Codespace in a new browser tab

    First-time setup may take a few minutes as GitHub provisions your environment.

### Build the agent

Once your Codespace loads with VSCode in the browser:

1. Open the integrated terminal

2. Create your environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Edit `.env` and add your API keys

1. Build the agent:

    ```bash
    task use
    ```

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    task run
    ```

### Start the frontend

Since Codespaces doesn't use Docker Compose, start the frontend separately:

1. Open a new terminal
1. Navigate to the playground directory:

    ```bash
    cd playground
    ```

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The frontend runs on port 3000.

### Access your application
Codespaces automatically creates URLs for exposed ports:

1. Click the Ports tab in the bottom panel

    ![Ports](/images/ten-agent/codespace_ports.png)

1. Find port 3000 and right-click its visibility setting

1. Select Public to make it accessible

    ![Change Visibility](/images/ten-agent/codespace_visibility.png)

1. Click the forwarded address for port 3000

    ![Forwarded Address](/images/ten-agent/codespace_forwarded_addr.png)

    Your browser opens the frontend in a new tab.

You have successfully set up a development environment for <Vpd k="NAME" /> using GitHub Codespaces. Start developing your agent directly in the cloud. Your Codespace provides the same development experience as local VSCode. You can:

- Set breakpoints and debug code
- Use extensions and terminal commands
- Commit and push changes to Git
