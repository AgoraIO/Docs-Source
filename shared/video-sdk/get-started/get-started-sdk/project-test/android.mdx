Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Enable developer options on your Android test device. Turn on USB debugging, connect the Android device to your development machine through a USB cable, and check that your device appears in the Android device options.

1. In Android Studio, click ![](/images/video-sdk/icon_android_gradle_sync.png) **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to resolve project dependencies and update the configuration.

1. After synchronization is successful, click ![](/images/video-sdk/icon_android_run.png) **Run app**. Android Studio starts compilation. After a few moments, the app is installed on your Android device.

1. Launch the App, grant recording and camera permissions. If you set the user role to host, you will see yourself in the local view.

1. On a second Android device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Test the following scenarios:

    * If both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one device joins as the host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video frame. The audience can see the host in the remote video frame and hear the host's voice.
