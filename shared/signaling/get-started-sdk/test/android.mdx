Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Use the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/) to generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

    1. Select Signaling from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
    1. Fill in your app ID and app certificate from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
    1. Click **Generate Token**.

1. In `strings.xml`, replace the values for `app_id` and `token` with your app ID and generated token.

1. Enable developer options on your Android test device. Turn on USB debugging, connect the Android device to your development machine through a USB cable, and check that your device appears in the Android device options.

1. In Android Studio, click **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to resolve project dependencies and update the configuration.

1. After synchronization is successful, click ▶️. Android Studio starts compilation. After a few moments, the app is installed and launched on your Android device.

1. Use the device as the receiving end and perform the following operations:

    1. Enter your **User ID** and click **Login**.
    1. Enter the **Channel name** and click **Subscribe** .

1. On a second Android device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Use this device as the sending end.

    1. Enter a different **User ID** and click **Login**.
    1. Enter the same **Channel name**.
    1. Type a message and click **Publish message**.

1. Swap the sending and receiving device roles and repeat the previous steps.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
