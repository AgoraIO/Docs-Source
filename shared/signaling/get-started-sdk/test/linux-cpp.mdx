Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In your code, replace the value for `app_id` with your app ID from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and save the project. Make sure Signaling is activated for your project.

    <Admonition>
    To facilitate testing of the app during development, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the Agora project, and then use the app ID in the `token` parameter when joining a channel.
    </Admonition>

1. In the terminal, run the following command to compile the project:

    ```shell
    sh +x clean_build.sh
    ```

1. Use the following commands to navigate to the `build` folder and run the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

    ```shell
    cd build
    ./RTMQuickStart
    ```

    You see menu options to **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**, **publish**, and **logout**. 

1. Follow the prompts to **subscribe** to a channel.

1. Run another instance of the app using a different user ID. Follow the prompts to **publish** a message to the same channel that you subscribed to from the other instance.

1. You see the message displayed in the instance that you used to subscribe to the channel.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
