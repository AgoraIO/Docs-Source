###	Dynamically load `Wasm` and `JS` file dependencies
    
The Spatial audio plugin depends on some `Wasm` and `JS` files. To ensure that the browser can load and run these files properly, take the following steps:

1.	Publish the `Wasm` and `JS` files in the  `node_modules/agora-extension-spatial-audio/external` directory to a `CDN` or static resource server. 

    * When you create a `SpatialAudioExtension` object, you pass the URL of the public path. The plugin dynamically loads the dependent files. Ensure the dependent files are in the same public folder.

    * If the URL where the `Wasm` and `JS` files are hosted is inconsistent with the URL where your Web application is hosted, you need to enable the CORS policy for accessing the file domain name.

    * Loading `HTTP` resources under `HTTPS` domain name is prohibited by browser security policy. You cannot put `Wasm` and `JS` files under `HTTP` service.

1.	If Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled, Chrome and Edge prohibit loading and running `Wasm` files by default. You need to configure CSP according to the browser version:

    * For Chrome 97 and Edge 97 or greater, add `script-src` in options `wasm-unsafe-eval`. For example:
    
        ```html
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'">
        ```

    * For browser versions below Chrome 97 and Edge 97, add `script-src` in options `unsafe-eval`.

#### setDistanceUnit

```javascript
public setDistanceUnit(unit: number): SpatialAudioErrorCode
```

Set the length in meters of the game engine unit distance.

The distance unit in the game engine is customized by the game engine, and the distance unit of the Agora spatial sound algorithm is meters. By default, the SDK converts each unit of game engine distance to one meter. You can call this method to convert the unit distance in the game engine to the specified number of meters.

**Parameter**

| Parameter | Description |
| :------ | :--------------------|
| `unit` | The converted meters per unit of game engine distance, the value must be greater than 0. For example, it will be unit set to 2, which means the game engine distance per unit is equal to 2 meters. The larger the value is, the faster the sound heard by the local user attenuates when the remote user is far away from the local user.|

**Returns**

See [`SpatialAudioErrorCode`](#spatialaudioerrorcode) for details.
