Developers can use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> REST APIs to connect phone users to real-time sessions through PSTN or SIP. Whether the session is audio-only or includes video, these users join through their phone for the audio portion of the channel.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
## Understand the tech
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> REST APIs allow developers to trigger inbound and outbound PSTN(Public Switched Telephone Network) and SIP(Session Initiation Protocol) calls. These then connect into an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel enabling end-users to participate with their phone for the audio leg of the conference call.
