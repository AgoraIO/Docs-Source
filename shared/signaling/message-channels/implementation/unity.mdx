### Subscribe to a channel

Use the `SubscribeAsync` method to subscribe to a message channel. After you subscribe, you receive `OnMessageEvent` and other event notifications for the channel.

```csharp
var options = new SubscribeOptions();

var (status,response) = await rtmClient.SubscribeAsync("Chat_room", options);
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}
else
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("Subscribe channel success! at Channel:{0}", response.ChannelName));
}
```

To subscribe to multiple channels, call `SubscribeAsync` multiple times:

```csharp
var options = new SubscribeOptions();

var (status1,response1) = await rtmClient.SubscribeAsync("chats.room1", options);
if (status1.Error)
{
    // your code
}

var (status2,response2) = await rtmClient.SubscribeAsync("chats.room2", options);
if (status2.Error)
{
    // your code
}
```

<Admonition type="info">
<Vg k="SIG" /> allows a single client to subscribe to up to 50 message channels simultaneously. However, to optimize client performance and bandwidth usage, best practice is to limit subscriptions to 30 channels. If you have very large or highly active channels, consider further reducing the number of simultaneous subscriptions.

### Send a message

To send messages in a message channel, simply call the `PublishAsync` method without subscribing to the channel. This method sends messages to one channel at a time. To send messages to multiple channels, call this method multiple times. <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> does not limit the number of channels to which you can send messages, or the number of users who can send messages to a channel. However, there are certain restrictions on the frequency at which you can send messages to a channel simultaneously. See [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations) for details.

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
The `PublishAsync` method can only be used with a message channel and a user channel; it does not apply to a stream channel.
</Admonition>

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```csharp
    // Sending a string message
    string message = "Hello World";
    string channelName = "chat_room";
    var options = new PublishOptions();
    options.customType = "PlainTxt";

    var (status,response) = await rtmClient.PublishAsync(channelName, message, options);
    if (status.Error)
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.Log("Publish Message Success!");
    }
    ```

* Binary message

    ```csharp
    // Sending a binary message
    byte[] message = new byte[] { 00, 01, 35, 196 };
    var channelName = "my_channel";
    var options = new PublishOptions();
    options.customType = "ByteArray";

    var (status,response) = await rtmClient.PublishAsync(channelName, message, options);
    if (status.Error)
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.Log("Publish Message Success!");
    }
    ```

<Admonition type="info">
<Vg k="SIG" /> currently supports only string and binary message formats. To send other types of data such as a JSON objects, or data from third-party data construction tools such as protobuf, serialize the data before sending the message. For information on how to effectively construct the payload data structure and recommended serialization methods, refer to [Message payload structuring](../core-functionality/message-payload-structuring).
</Admonition>

### Customize channel subscription

By default, you receive message events for all channels you subscribe to. If you don't wish to receive messages from specific channels, while still receiving other types of event notifications from these channels, adjust the subscription settings accordingly. Refer to the following code snippet:

```csharp
var options = new SubscribeOptions();
options.withMessage = false;

var (status,response) = await rtmClient.SubscribeAsync("Chat_room", options);

```

In this example, setting `withMessage` to `false`, ensures that messages from `Chat_room` do not trigger event notifications. However, you continue to receive notifications for other events, such as presence updates, metadata changes, and lock status alterations.

### Unsubscribe from a channel

To stop receiving message and all other event notifications from a channel, call `UnsubscribeAsync`.

```csharp
var (status,response) = await rtmClient.UnsubscribeAsync("chats.room1");
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}
```

This method only unsubscribes from one channel at a time. To unsubscribe from multiple channels, call this method multiple times.
