    You need to fill the `x-agora-token` and `x-agora-uid` fields in the request header with the following information:

    -   The Signaling token generated from your server

    -   The Signaling user ID used to generate the Signaling token

- **AccessToken2**

    You need to fill the `Authorization: agora token=` field with the RTM [AccessToken2](../develop/authentication) generated from your server.

- **AccessToken**

    You need to fill the `x-agora-token` and `x-agora-uid` fields in the request header with the following information:

    - The RTM [AccessToken]((https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm?platform=All%20Platforms)) generated from your server
    - The RTM user ID used to generate the RTM token

    Implement HTTP basic authentication or token authentication on the server; otherwise, you may encounter the risk of data leakage.
