![Create UMG](/images/video-sdk/unreal-create-umg.png)

To create the UI interface shown above:

1. Create **Widget Blueprint**.

    1. In the **Content Browser** of the **Content** folder, right-click and select **User Interface > Widget Blueprint** to create a **Widget Blueprint** and name it `BP_VideoWidget`.
    1. Double-click to open `BP_VideoWidget`. You see `BP_VideoWidget > Canvas Panel` in the hierarchy.

1. Create local and remote video windows in the **Widget Blueprint**.

    1. To create a view background, select **Common > Image** in the **Palette** panel, drag it to the **Canvas** Panel and name it `background`. Adjust the size of the canvas by dragging it, and adjust the background color in the details panel.
    1. Create a local view window. In the **Palette** panel, select **Common > Image** and drag it to the **Canvas** Panel. Name it `Img_LocalVideoView`. Adjust the position and size of the canvas the details panel as follows:

        - **Position X**：-500
        - **Position Y**：-100
        - **Size X**：640
        - **Size Y**：360

    1. Repeat the above steps to create a remote view window, name it `Img_RemoteVideoView`, and adjust its position and size as follows:

        - **Position X**：500
        - **Position Y**：-100
        - **Size X**：640
        - **Size Y**：360

1. Create buttons to join and leave the channel in the **Widget Blueprint**.

    1. Create a join channel button. Select **Common > Button**, drag it to the **Canvas Panel**, rename it `Btn_JoinChannel`, and adjust its position and size in the canvas:

        - **Position X**：-500

        - **Size Y**：130

    1. Select **Common > Text**, drag it to `Btn_JoinChannel`, and in the details panel, modify the content of **Text** to `JoinChannel`.
    1. Repeat the above steps to create a **Leave Channel** button, name it `Btn_LeaveChannel`, and change the **Text** content to `LeaveChannel`. Adjust the button's position and size in the canvas:

        - **Position X**：500
        - **Position Y**：200
        - **Size X**：130
        - **Size Y**：130

1. Save your changes.

### Blueprint implementation

This section shows you how to use <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement real-time audio and video interaction functionality in your project.

1. **Create a level Blueprint**

    1. In the **Content Browser** of the **Content** folder , right-click and select **Level** to create a **Level Blueprint** and name it `BasicVideoCallScene`.

    1. Double-click `BasicVideoCallScene` above the editor and click **Blueprints > Open Level Blueprint**:

        ![Open Level Blueprint](/images/video-sdk/unreal-open-level-blueprint.png)

1. **Implement basic processes**

    In the **My Blueprint** panel, double-click **Graphs > EventGraph** to open the event graph, which already has two event nodes: **Event Begin Play** (game start) and **Event End Play** (game end). Next, create event nodes and corresponding functions and variables related to real-time audio and video interactions. Connect them to realize the logic of real-time audio and video interaction:

    ![Implement Basic Processes](/images/video-sdk/unreal-impl-basic-processes.png)

    The main nodes are as follows:

    | Node| Type | Description|
    |:----|:-----|:-----------|
    | Set Show Mouse Cursor | Native* | <p>(Optional) Set whether to display the mouse cursor. Check to display.</p><ul><li>This node is only available on Windows and macOS.</li><li>If the node cannot be retrieved at creation time, you can uncheck Context Sensitive</li></ul>  |
    | Load Agora Config | Custom** | Load Agora configuration. Used to later verify user identity when creating and joining channels |
    | Create BP Video Widget Widget | Native | <p>Create user interface:</p><ol><li>Create **Create Widget** node.</li><li>Select the node's Class as **BP_VideoWidget** and associate the node with the already created user interface.</li></ol> |
    | Set Basic Video Call Widget | Custom | <p>Set up the user interface:</p><ol><li>Create the `BasicVideoCallWidget` variable and select the **Variable Type** of the variable as `BP_VideoWidget`, which is the user interface that has been created and is used to store a reference to the user interface in the blueprint.</li><li>After dragging the created variables to EventGraph two options, **Set BasicVideoCallWidget** and **Get BasicVideoCallWidget**, will appear. Select **Set BasicVideoCallWidget** to create a node for accessing and setting the user interface.</li></ol> |
    | BindUIEvent | Custom | Bind UI events to handle event logic after clicking the **JoinChannel** and **LeaveChannel** buttons. |
    | Add to Viewport | Native | 	Add user interface to the viewport. |
    | Check Permission | Custom | (Optional) Check whether you have obtained the system permissions required for real-time audio and video interaction, such as access to the camera and microphone. If your target platform is Android, you need to create this node to check system permissions. |
    | Init Rtc Engine | Custom | 	Create and initialize the RTC engine. |
    | Un Init Rtc Engine | Custom | 	Leave the channel and release resources. |

    \* Native nodes come with the blueprint and can be added and called directly.<br/>
    ** Custom nodes are not included in the blueprint. You need to create a custom function before you can add the corresponding node.

1.  **Add the variables to join a channel**

    1. Create three variables `Token`, `ChannelId`, `AppId` and select **Variable Type** as **String**.
    1. In the `Load Agora Config` function, add the `Sequence` node, and then connect **Set Token**, **Set Channel Id**, and **Set App Id** respectively. Fill in the **Token**, **channel name** and **App ID** obtained from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for verification of user identity before creating and joining a channel.

        ![Add Channel Related Variables](/images/video-sdk/unreal-add-channel-related-variables.png)

1. **Initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" />**

    1. If your target platform is Android, check whether you have obtained Android system permissions before initializing the <Vg k="ENGINE" />. In the `CheckPermission` function, refer to the figure below to create nodes to add permissions such as access to the microphone and camera in the Android system:

        ![Check Android Permissions](/images/video-sdk/unreal-check-android-permissions.png)

    1. In the `InitRtcEngine` function, refer to the figure below to create and connect nodes to initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />:

        ![Initialize Agora Engine](/images/video-sdk/unreal-init-agora-engine.png)

    The main steps are as follows:
        1. Create `IRtcEngine` and `IRtcEngineEventHandler`.
            1. Create `RtcEngine` and `EventHandler` variables, and set the **Variable Type** to **Agora Rtc Engine** and **IRtc Engine Event Handler** respectively, which are the basic function classes and event callback classes of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK, used to store references to these two interface classes in the blueprint.
            1. Add two **Construct Object From Class** nodes, set **Class** to **Agora Rtc Engine** and **IRtc Engine Event Handler** respectively, and connect Set Rtc Engine and Set Event Handler respectively.

        2. Binding `IRtcEngineEventHandler` class-related callback functions.
            1. Create `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined` and `onUserOffline` callback functions.

                | Callback | Description | Input parameters |
                |:--------|:------------------|:------------|
                | `FOnJoinChannelSuccess` | Successfully added channel callback. | <ul><li>`channel`: (String) Channel name.</li><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The user ID that joined the channel.</li><li>`elapsed`: (Integer) The time (in milliseconds) that has elapsed from the local call to `JoinChannel` till the occurrence of this event.</li></ul> |
                | `FOnLeaveChannel` | Leave channel callback. | <ul><li>`stats`: Call statistics. See details FRtcStats.</li></ul> |
                | `FOnUserJoined` | Callback when remote viewers or anchors join the current channel. | <ul><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The user ID of the remote viewer or anchor joining the channel.</li><li>`elapsed`: (Integer) The time (in milliseconds) that has elapsed from the local call to `JoinChannel` till the occurrence of this event.</li></ul> |
                | `FOnUserOffline` | Callback when a remote viewer or host leaves the current channel. | <ul><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The user ID of the offline viewer or host.</li><li>`reason`: Offline reason. See details `EUSER_OFFLINE_REASON_TYPE`.</li></ul> |

            1. Create the **Bind Event** function. In this function, add the **Sequence** node, and then bind the `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined` and `onUserOffline` callback events respectively.

            ![Create Bind Event](/images/video-sdk/unreal-create-bind-event.png)

        3. Initialize `IRtcEngine`:
            1. Call `initialize` to initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />.
            1. Connect `RtcEngineContext` configuration `IRtcEngine` Example, select **Channel Profile** as `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING` (live broadcast scenario).

1. **Bind UI events**

    1. Create and implement the `OnJoinChannelClicked` event callback.

        ![Join Channel Clicked](/images/video-sdk/unreal-join-channel-clicked-event.png)

    The main steps are as follows:
        1. Call **Enable Video** and **Enable Audio** to enable the video and audio modules.
        2. Call **Join Channel** to join the channel.
        3. Create `ChannelMediaOptions` with the following parameters:
            - Set **Publish Camera Track** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the video stream collected by the camera.
            - Set **Publish Microphone Track** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the audio stream collected by the microphone.
            - Set **Auto Subscribe Video** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all video streams.
            - Set **Auto Subscribe Audio** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all audio streams.
            - Check **Client Role Type Set Value** and set **Client Role Type** to `CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER` or `CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE`, and set the user role to host or audience.
            - Check **Channel Profile Set Value** and set **Channel Profile** to `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING`, and the **channel scene** to **live broadcast scene**.

    2. Create and implement the `OnLeaveChannelClicked` event callback. When the event is triggered, call **Leave Channel** to leave the channel.

        ![Leave Channel Clicked](/images/video-sdk/unreal-leave-channel-clicked-event.png)

    3. In the **Bind UIEvent** function, refer to the figure below to bind the `OnJoinChannelClicked` and `OnLeaveChannelClicked` buttons respectively callback functions to the `JoinChannel` and `LeaveChannel`. When the button is clicked, the corresponding event callback will be triggered.

        ![Bind Join Leave Callbacks](/images/video-sdk/unreal-bind-join-leave-callbacks.png)

1. **Set up local and remote views**

    1. Create and implement the `MakeVideoView` function to load the view when local or remote viewers or hosts join the channel:

        ![Implement Make Video View](/images/video-sdk/unreal-impl-make-video-view.png)

        The main steps are as follows:
            1. In this function, create `SavedUID`, `SavedSourceType`, `SavedChannelID` local variables, set the **Variable Type** to `Integer64`, `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE`, `String` respectively, and save the variables for use when loading the view later.
            1. Create a local view. In the local view, the uid is 0, randomly assigned by the SDK, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_PRIMARY` (the first camera).
            1. Create a remote view. In the remote view, uid is the uid sent from the remote end, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_REMOTE` (remote video obtained from the network).

    2. Create and implement the `ReleaseVideoView` function to release the view when a local or remote viewer or host leaves the channel.

        ![Implement Release Video View](/images/video-sdk/unreal-impl-release-video-view.png)

    The main steps are as follows:
        1. In this function, create `SavedUID`, `SavedSourceType`, `SavedChannelID` local variables, set the **Variable Type** to `Integer64`, `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE`, `String` respectively, and save the variables for use when releasing the view later.
        1. Release the local view.
        1. Release the remote view.

1. **Implement callback function**

    Configure the previously created `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined`, and `onUserOffline` callback functions according to the following implementation steps:

        1. After the local user successfully joins the channel, `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback is triggered and the local view is created. The `uid` is set to 0 but by default it is randomly assigned by SDK. The video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_PRIMARY` (first camera):

        ![Join Channel Success Callback](/images/video-sdk/unreal-join-channel-success-callback.png)

        2. After the local user leaves the channel, `onLeaveChannel` callback is triggered which releases the local view:

        ![Leave Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/unreal-leave-channel-callback.png)

        3. When a remote user joins the channel, `onUserJoined` callback triggers to create a remote view, `uid` is the `uid` sent from the remote end, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_REMOTE` (remote video obtained from the network):

        ![Remote User Join Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/unreal-remote-user-join-channel-callback.png)

        4. When the remote user leaves the channel, callback `onUserOffline` is triggered to release the remote view:

        ![Remote User Leave Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/unreal-remote-user-leave-channel-callback.png)

1. **Leave the channel and release resources**

    Refer to the figure below to implement the `UnInitRtcEngine` function:

    ![Leave Channel and Release Resources](/images/video-sdk/unreal-leave-channel-and-release-resources.png)

    The main steps are as follows:
        1. Leave the channel.
        1. Unregister <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> event callback.
        1. Destroy `IRtcEngineObject` to release all resources used by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK.
