<Vg k="COMPANY" />'s <Vpd k="NAME" /> service is specially developed for live broadcast scenarios in real-time interactive products.

The cloud transcoding service allows you to obtain the audio and video source streams of the host in the RTC channel on the server side, and perform audio and video processing such as transcoding, mixing, and combining images on them. Finally, the processed audio and video streams are published to the RTC channel of the sound network for the audience to subscribe.

By using cloud-based transcoding services, viewers do not need to subscribe to multiple hostsâ€™ audio and video streams, thereby reducing downstream bandwidth pressure and performance consumption of client devices.
