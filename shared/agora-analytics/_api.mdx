Before working with the RESTful APIs, review the <Vpd k="NAME"/> features in <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> to gain a visual understanding of the quality and usage metrics that are available. For details, see the following user guides:

-   [Call Inspector](#call-inspector)

-   [Data Insights](#data-insights)

-   [Real-time Monitoring](#real-time-monitoring)


<div class="alert info">To use Agora Analytics RESTful APIs, subscribe to an <a href="../overview/pricing">Agora Analytics pricing plan</a>.</div>

## Authentication

Before using the Agora RESTful API, you need to pass the [basic HTTP authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).

## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Request: The request uses query string parameters in the URL.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.

## Call Inspector

With the Call Inspector RESTful APIs, you can search for calls with quality issues and obtain detailed metrics about call quality.

### API limits

The limits of the Call Inspector RESTful APIs depend on the [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/overview/pricing) you subscribe to.

The Starter, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise pricing plans have the following differences in terms of API limits:

<div class="alert info"><li>Request frequency is calculated using the server's UTC time.</li>
<li>Data delay refers to the time required from the generation of data to the point where it can be queried.</li></div>

## <a name="monitor"></a>Real-time Monitoring

With the Real-time Monitoring RESTful APIs, you can query the scale and quality metrics within a specified time frame. The granularity of the returned data is seconds, which can reflect the actual situation in close to real time.

The data is returned in regular 20-second time windows starting from 00:00:00. For example, [00:00:00, 00:00:20] is a time window, while [00:00:10, 00:00:30] is not a time window.

### API limits

The limits of the Real-time Monitoring RESTful APIs depend on the [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/overview/pricing) you subscribe to.

The Starter, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise pricing plans have the following differences in terms of API limits:

|                   | Starter | Standard                          | Premium                           | Enterprise                          |
| :---------------- | ------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Request frequency | N/A     | N/A | No more than 3/minute and 480/day | No more than 10/minute and 1440/day |
| Available data    | N/A     | N/A         | Within the past 40 minutes        | Within the past 60 minutes          |
| Query time frame  | N/A     | N/A          | No longer than 40 minutes         | No longer than 60 minutes           |
| Data delay        | N/A     | N/A                    | 40 seconds                        | 20 seconds                          |

| `ts`     | Number | The start point (Unix timestamp) of the time frame to query. The actual query range is [ts, ts + 20s]. |
| `appid`       | String | The [App ID](./reference/glossary#app-id) of your project. |
| `productType` | String | The product for which you want to query the metrics. You can set it to:<li>`Native`: The Agora Video SDK for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.</li><li>`WebRTC`: The Agora Video SDK for Web.</li> |
| `metric`      | String | The metrics you want to query. You can set it to one of the following options:<li>`joinSuccessRate`: The rate at which users attempting to join any channel succeed, which equals Number of users who have joined ÷ Number of attempts to join.</li><li>`joinSuccessIn5sRate`: The rate at which users attempting to join any channel succeed within 5 seconds, which equals Number of users who have joined within 5 seconds ÷ Number of attempts to join.</li><li>`audioFreezeRate`: The rate at which audio freezing occurs, which equals Total audio freeze time ÷ Total audio minutes calculated by the number of streams. Only audio freezes longer than 200 milliseconds are counted.</li><li>`videoFreezeRate`: The rate at which video freezing occurs, which equals Total video freeze time ÷ Total video minutes calculated by the number of streams. Only video freezes longer than 600 milliseconds are counted.</li><li>`networkDelay`: The rate at which network delay occurs, which equals Total end-to-end network delay ÷ Total audio and video minutes calculated by the number of streams. Only end-to-end network delays longer than 400 milliseconds are counted.</li> |
| `dimension` | String | The dimension to be used for aggregation. Only single-dimensional values are supported, and the following values are allowed: <li>`country`: Country. </li><li>`region`: Region. </li><li>`network`: Network type. </li><li>`sdkVersion`: SDK version. </li><li>`os`: Operating system. </li><li>`device`: Device model. </li>If this parameter is set, the request will return the top 20 (top 50 for `device` dimension) values in the corresponding dimension by default. |
| `cname`       | String | (Optional) The channel name. If you do not specify this parameter, the metric data of your entire project (rather than a specific channel) is returned. |

#### Request example
