Refer to Microsoft documentation to [Create a C++ console application project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-1-create) in Visual Studio.

### Integrate the SDK

To integrate the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/>:

1. Download the latest Windows [SDK](/sdks).

1. Unzip and open the downloaded SDK. Copy all subfolders in `sdk/` to your solution folder. Make sure these subfolders are in the same directory as your `.sln` file.

In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the project name and click **Properties** to configure the following:

1. Go to the **C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories** menu, click **Edit**, and in the pop-up window enter `$(SolutionDir)include`.

1. Go to the **Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies** menu, click **Edit**, and in the pop-up window enter `agora_rtc_sdk.dll.lib`.

After the configuration is complete, click **OK**.

### Create a user interface

Create a user interface for your project based on your application scenario. If you have already created a user interface, skip to the next step.

To create a basic UI, add the following controls:
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
* Host video window
* Leave channel button
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
* Join channel button
* Leave channel button
* An input field for the channel name
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
Refer to the sample project, to create the following interface:

</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
Refer to the following steps to create a user interface:
<details>
<summary>Steps to create a minimalistic UI</summary>

    1. Set the description text to `Join` and `Leave` respectively.

    Your interface looks similar to the following:
