To test the sample code, follow these steps:

1. **Generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token using the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/):**

   1. From the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> product dropdown, select **Signaling**.
   1. Enter your App ID and App Certificate from the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. You can leave the other fields blank.
   1. Click **Generate Token**.

2. **Update the configuration:**

   In `signaling.tsx`, replace the following placeholders with your actual values:

   * `APP_ID`: Your Agora App ID
   * `TOKEN`: The token you generated
   * `CHANNEL_ID`: Your chosen channel name
   * `USER_ID`: A unique identifier for the user

3. **Run the app from the project root:**

   * **Android:**

     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```

   * **iOS:**

     ```bash
     npm run ios
     ```

4. **Log in on the first device:**

   * Use this device as the receiver.
   * Install and launch the app.
   * Once the app starts, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> automatically logs in and subscribes to the specified channel.

5. **Log in on the second device:**

   * Use this device as the sender.
   * Install and launch the app.
   * Enter a message and tap **Send**.

6. **Switch roles to test bidirectional messaging:**

   * Use the first device as the sender and the second as the receiver.
   * Repeat the previous steps.
