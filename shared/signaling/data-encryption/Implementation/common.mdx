The <Vpd k="SDK" /> includes a built-in AES 256 GCM encryption algorithm. To enable end-to-end encryption and decryption, simply configure the encryption mode, encryption key, and salt parameters when initializing the <Vg k="SIG"/> client instance. After encryption is enabled, the SDK automatically encrypts messages before transmission and decrypts them upon receipt, using the same encryption parameters. Your data is protected throughout the transmission pipeline. Even if a message is temporarily stored on the <Vg k="SIG" /> server, it remains cryptographically protected and cannot be accessed without the correct key and salt.

Refer to the following sample code to configure end-to-end encryption:

<EndToEndEncryptionConfig />

When automatic encryption and decryption is enabled, all clients under the same app ID must enable this feature and use the same encryption parameters to communicate smoothly.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
Automatic encryption and decryption may impact functionality in some scenarios. For instance, if you use mobile push notifications, <Vg k="SIG" /> is unable to read the mobile push keys and values provided in the message payload due to encryption. In such scenarios, only encrypt the sensitive data in the message payload and keep other data segments in plain text. This partial encryption feature may be provided in future versions of <Vpd k="SDK" />.
