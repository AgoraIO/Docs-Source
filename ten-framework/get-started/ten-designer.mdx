  Visual development environment for TEN Framework: install, configure, and build AI agents with a web-based interface for creating and debugging extensions.
---

TEN Designer is a web-based visual development environment that simplifies building and debugging applications with the TEN Framework. Instead of working solely with command-line tools and configuration files, TEN Designer provides an intuitive graphical interface for creating, editing, and managing TEN applications and extensions.

**Key benefits:**

- **Visual graph editing** - See and modify extension connections through an interactive diagram
- **Simplified dependency management** - Install and manage TEN packages through a user-friendly interface
- **Integrated development workflow** - Build, run, and debug applications without leaving the designer
- **Cloud Store integration** - Browse and install extensions directly from the TEN Cloud Store
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS through your web browser

TEN Designer enables developers who prefer visual tools while maintaining the full power and flexibility of the TEN Framework.

In the upper left corner of TEN Designer, there are several dropdown menus that you can use to access various functions of TEN Designer.

## Working with TEN apps

This section guides you through working with TEN apps in the TEN designer.

### Load an existing TEN app

Load an existing TEN App using the **Load App** button in the **App** menu. After clicking the button, you see the following interface:

![Loading an Existing TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_load_app.png)

To load an existing TEN App, use the file browser to specify the app's root directory.

### Manage loaded TEN apps

To manage loaded TEN apps, use the **Manage Loaded App(s)** button in the **App** menu. Click the button to open the following **Apps Manager** interface:

![Managing Loaded TEN Apps](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_manage_loaded_apps.png)

You can use this dialog to:

- Unload loaded TEN Apps
- Reload specified TEN Apps
- Reload all loaded TEN Apps
- Install all dependencies for specified Apps
- Run functions for specific Apps

### Installing dependencies for an app

Use the **Apps Manager** to install various TEN packages in a TEN app. The `manifest.json` file records all TEN packages that a TEN App depends on. Following is an example of a `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "type": "app",
  "name": "aaa",
  "version": "0.8.18",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime",
      "version": "0.8.18"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_muxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_demuxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_client",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "protocol",
      "name": "msgpack",
      "version": "^0.8.18"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python3 tools/run_script.py start",
    "build": "python3 tools/run_script.py build"
  }
}
```

The sample configuration shows that this TEN App depends on the following TEN packages:

- `ten_runtime`: The system package of TEN Framework
- `ffmpeg_demuxer`: A TEN Extension package for decoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_muxer`: A TEN Extension package for encoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_client`: A TEN Extension package for processing audio and video using the other two ffmpeg extension packages
- `msgpack`: A TEN Protocol package for message serialization and deserialization using the MessagePack protocol

After installation of all dependencies for this TEN App, the TEN package file structure in the system is as follows:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_client
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_demuxer
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_muxer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protocol
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ msgpack
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_runtime
```

It's worth noting that even though it's not explicitly declared in the `manifest.json`, there is an additional `ffmpeg` package in the system. This is because `ffmpeg_demuxer` and `ffmpeg_muxer` depend on the `ffmpeg` system package, and TEN Manager automatically identifies and installs these transitive dependencies.

Through the **Apps Manager** interface in TEN Designer, use the **Install All** operation on a specified app to easily complete the installation of all dependencies. After clicking the button, you see the following interface showing the installation progress:

![Installing All Dependencies for an App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_install_all.png)

### Installing TEN extensions from the Cloud Store

To install TEN extensions to the current TEN app, open the TEN Cloud Store using the **Open Extension Store** button in the **Graph** menu. You see the following interface:

![TEN Cloud Store](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_store.png)

Search for the required TEN extensions and click the **Install** button to install the selected extension to the current TEN App. After installation, you can see the extensions in the current TEN App.

### Running a TEN app

Using the **Apps Manager**, you can perform preset runtime operations on the specified app. After clicking the **Run** button in the **Apps Manager**, you see the following interface:

![Running a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_run.png)

In the dialog, select the preset operation to execute from the dropdown menu. These typically include the following operations:

- Run App: Start the app and display the app's output information in the TEN Designer message window.
- Build App: Compile the app. Since TEN Framework supports multiple programming languages, some languages need to be compiled while others do not. For example, TEN apps developed in C++ need to be compiled, while TEN apps developed in Python do not.

Following is the build interface for a TEN app developed in C++:

![Building a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_build.png)

After the build is complete, continue with the startup operation for the TEN App. The system displays a window showing the TEN app's runtime logs in real-time:

![Starting a TEN App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_start.png)

## Working with TEN graphs

### Loading an existing TEN graph

To load an existing TEN graph, use the **Open Existing Graph** button in the **Graph** menu. After the graph loads, you see an interface similar to the following:

![TEN Graph](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_graph_overview.png)

This sample graph contains three TEN Extensions:

- `ffmpeg_demuxer`
- `ffmpeg_muxer`
- `ffmpeg_client`

Each TEN extension has inputs and outputs. For example, `ffmpeg_demuxer` has the following inputs and outputs:

- 2 cmd inputs
- 1 cmd output
- 1 audio_frame output
- 1 video_frame output

Clicking on the number buttons for inputs and outputs opens a dialog similar to the following. Use this interface to manage input and output connections:

![TEN Message Input/Output Dialog](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_msg_info_dialog.png)

### Auto-layout graph

After manually adjusting the positions of TEN extensions in the TEN graph, click the **Auto Layout** button in the **Graph** menu to automatically arrange the TEN extensions in the TEN graph.

### Opening the context menu for TEN extensions

In the graph, right-clicking a TEN extension opens the extension's context menu:

![TEN Extension Context Menu](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_context_menu.png)

The context menu makes it convenient to modify and customize TEN extensions. Using the context menu, you can open the TEN extension's `manifest.json` file, `property.json` file, or directly start a terminal in the root directory of the TEN extension.
