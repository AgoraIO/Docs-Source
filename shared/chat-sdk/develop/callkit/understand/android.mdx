1. Initialize `AgoraChatCallKit` by calling `init` and add the `AgoraChatCallKit` event listener by calling `setCallKitListener`.
2. Call `startSingleCall` or `startInviteMultipleCall` on the caller's client to send a call invitation for one-to-one or group calls.
3. On the callee's client, accept or decline the call invitation after receiving `onReceivedCall`. Once a user accepts the invitation, they enter the call.
4. When the call ends, the SDK triggers the `onEndCallWithReason` callback.
