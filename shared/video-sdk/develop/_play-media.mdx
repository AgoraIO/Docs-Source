Users often need to play video and audio files during online social and business interactions. <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to add media playing functionality to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This page shows you how to use the media player classes in <Vg k="VSDK" /> to enable your users to publish media files to a channel.

## Understand the tech

When a user selects a media file to play, you open the media file using a media player instance. When the file is ready to be played, you setup the local video container to display the media player output. You update the channel media options to start publishing the media player stream, then stop publishing the camera and microphone streams. The remote user sees the camera and microphone streams of the media publishing user replaced by media streams.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate media player functionality into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
