### Implement the user interface

To implement call quality features, you make some UI changes in the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> project interface.

1. **Display network status**

    To enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to see the network status, you add a `_networkStatus` widget to the user interface. To update the UI, open `/lib/main.dart` and add the following lines after `ListView(...children: [` in the `build` method:

    ```dart
    _networkStatus(),
    const SizedBox(height: 8),
    ```

2. **Design the network status widget**

    The network status widget shows a colored circle that indicates the health of the network connection. In `/lib/main.dart`, add the following code after the `build` method:

    ```dart
    Widget _networkStatus() {
        Color statusColor;
        if (networkQuality > 0 && networkQuality < 3) {
            statusColor = Colors.green;
        } else if (networkQuality <= 4) {
            statusColor = Colors.yellow;
        } else if (networkQuality <= 6) {
            statusColor = Colors.red;
        } else {
            statusColor = Colors.grey;
        }

        return Row(mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end, children: <Widget>[
        const Text("Network status: "),
        CircleAvatar(
            foregroundColor: Colors.black,
            backgroundColor: statusColor,
            radius: 10,
            child: Text(networkQuality.toString()),
        )
        ]);
    }
    ```

### Implement features to ensure quality

To implement the call quality features, take the following steps:

1. **Declare variables to manage test state and workflow**

    In `/lib/main.dart`, add the following declarations to `_MyAppState` class:

    ```dart
    int networkQuality = 0; // Quality index of the network connection
    int counter1 = 0; // Controls the frequency of notifications
    int counter2 = 0; // Controls the frequency of notifications
    ```

1. **Run a network quality test**

    In `_MyAppState` class, add the following method to start a last mile probe test:

    ```dart
    void startProbeTest() {
        // Configure the probe test
        LastmileProbeConfig config = const LastmileProbeConfig(
            probeUplink: true, 
            probeDownlink: true, 
            expectedUplinkBitrate: 100000,  // Range 100000-5000000 bps
            expectedDownlinkBitrate: 100000, // Range 100000-5000000 bps
        );
        agoraEngine.startLastmileProbeTest(config);
        showMessage("Running the last mile probe test ...");
    }
    ```

1. **Implement best practice for app initiation**

    When a user starts your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, <Vg k="ENGINE" /> is initialized in `setupVoiceSDKEngine`. After initialization, do the following:

    * _Set an audio profile and audio scenario_: Setting an audio profile is optional and only required if you have special requirements such as streaming  music.
    * _Start the network probe test_: A quick test at startup to gauge network quality.

    To implement these features, add the following code to `setupVoiceSDKEngine` before `agoraEngine.registerEventHandler(`;

    ```dart
    // Set audio profile and audio scenario.
    agoraEngine.setAudioProfile(
        profile: AudioProfileType.audioProfileDefault,
        scenario: AudioScenarioType.audioScenarioChatroom);

    // Start the probe test
    startProbeTest();
    ```

1. **Listen to <Vg k="ENGINE" /> events to receive state change notifications and quality statistics**

    Add the following event handlers to receive state change notifications and quality statistics:

    * `onConnectionStateChanged`: Receives notification of any change in the connection state.
    * `onLastmileQuality`: Receives the network quality result.
    * `onLastmileProbeResult`: Receives detailed probe test results.
    * `onNetworkQuality`: Receives statistics on network quality.
    * `onRtcStats`: Receives the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> stats.
    * `onRemoteAudioStateChanged`: Receives notification regarding any change in the state of the remote audio.
    * `onRemoteAudioStats`: Receives stats about remote audio for each user and the host. 

    In the `setupVoiceSDKEngine()` method, add the following code after `RtcEngineEventHandler(`:

    ```dart
    onConnectionStateChanged: (RtcConnection connection,
        ConnectionStateType state, ConnectionChangedReasonType reason) {
        showMessage(
            "Connection state changed\n New state: ${state.name}\n Reason: ${reason.name}");
    },
    onLastmileQuality: (QualityType quality) {
        setState(() {
        networkQuality = quality.index;
        });
    },
    onLastmileProbeResult: (LastmileProbeResult result) {
        agoraEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
        // The result object contains the detailed test results that help you
        // manage call quality, for example, the down link jitter.
        showMessage("Downlink jitter: ${result.downlinkReport?.jitter}");
    },
    onNetworkQuality: (RtcConnection connection, int remoteUid,
        QualityType txQuality, QualityType rxQuality) {
        // Use downlink network quality to update the network status
        setState(() {
        networkQuality = rxQuality.index;
        });
    },
    onRtcStats: (RtcConnection connection, RtcStats stats) {
        counter1 += 1;
        String msg = "";

        if (counter1 == 5) {
        msg = "${stats.userCount} user(s)";
        } else if (counter1 == 10) {
        msg = "Packet loss rate: ${stats.rxPacketLossRate}";
        counter1 = 0;
        }
        if (msg.isNotEmpty) showMessage(msg);
    },
    onRemoteAudioStateChanged: (RtcConnection connection,
        int remoteUid, RemoteAudioState state,
        RemoteAudioStateReason reason, int elapsed) {
        String msg = "Remote audio state changed: \n Uid: $uid"
            " \n NewState: $state\n reason: $reason\n elapsed: $elapsed";

        showMessage(msg);
    },
    onRemoteAudioStats: (RtcConnection connection, RemoteAudioStats stats) {
        counter2 += 1;
        if (counter2 == 5) {
        String msg = "Remote Audio Stats:\n User id: ${stats.uid}"
            "\n Received bitrate: ${stats.receivedBitrate}"
            "\n Total frozen time: ${stats.totalFrozenTime}";
        counter2 = 0;
        showMessage(msg);
        }
    },
    ```

1. **Configure the <Vpd k="SDK" /> log file**

    To customize the location, content and size of log files, add the following code to `setupVoiceSDKEngine` under `agoraEngine.initialize`:

    ```dart
    logConfig: LogConfig(
        //filePath: "<your custom file path>",
        fileSizeInKB: 256,
        level:LogLevel.logLevelWarn
    )
    ```
    If you want to upload the log file automatically to a CDN, call `agoraEngine.setLocalAccessPoint(LocalAccessPointConfiguration config)` to specify the local access point and assign the native access module to the SDK.
