3. In Android Studio, open `app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity` and update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values from Agora Console.

4. Connect an Android device to your development device.

5. In Android Studio, click **Run app**. A moment later, you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run your app, grant camera and microphone permissions.

6. Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.

7. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your Android device as you move the slider on the `SeekBar` to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap the **Mute** `CheckBox` while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app.
        
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your Android device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `onProgressChanged` replace the `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUid,volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `onCheckedChanged` replace the `muteRemoteAudioStream` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isChecked);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(isChecked);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.
