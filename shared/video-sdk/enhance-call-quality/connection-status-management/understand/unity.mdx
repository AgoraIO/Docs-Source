![Disconnection Connection](/images/video-sdk/connection-state-unity.png)

In the diagram:
- **T0**: The <Vpd k="SDK" /> receives a `JoinChannel` request from `UID1`.
- **T1**: After 200 ms of calling `JoinChannel`, `UID1` joins the channel. At the same time, `UID1` receives `OnConnectionStateChanged(CONNECTING, CONNECTING)` callback. After successfully joining the channel, `UID1` receives `OnConnectionStateChanged(CONNECTED, JOIN_SUCCESS)` and `OnJoinChannelSuccess` callbacks.
- **T2**: Due to the transmission delay between networks, `UID2` observes a delay of about 100 milliseconds for `UID1` to join the channel, and at this point `UID2` receives a `OnUserJoined` callback.
- **T3**: When `UID1` client's connection deteriorates due to a network issue or some other reason, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically tries to rejoin the channel.
- **T4**: If `UID1` does not receive any data from the server for 4 consecutive seconds, `UID1` receives the `OnConnectionStateChanged(RECONNCTING, INTERRUPTED)` callback. Meanwhile, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> continues to try to rejoin the channel.
- **T5**: If `UID1` does not receive any data from the server for 10 consecutive seconds after receiving `OnConnectionStateChanged(RECONNCTING, INTERRUPTED)`, `UID1` receives the `OnConnectionLost` callback. Meanwhile, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> continues to try to rejoin the channel.
- **T6**: If `UID2` does not receive any data from `UID1` for 20 consecutive seconds, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> determines that `UID1` is offline. So `UID2` receives the `onUserOffline` callback.
- **T7**: If `UID1` fails to rejoin the channel for 20 consecutive minutes after receiving `OnConnectionStateChanged(RECONNCTING, INTERRUPTED)`, the SDK stops retrying. `UID1` receives the `OnConnectionStateChanged(FAILED, JOIN_FAILED)` callback and the user must exit and then rejoin the channel.
