The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK provides a `setVolume` method for both local and remote audio track objects to adjust the volume of local audio capture and remote audio playback.

### Adjust the playback volume of remote audio

In this example, `remoteUser` refers to a subscribed remote user object.

```javascript
// Reduce the volume by half
AudioTrack.audioTrack.setVolume(50);
// Use the original volume
remoteUser.audioTrack.setVolume(100);
// Set the remote volume to 0
remoteUser.audioTrack.setVolume(0);
```

### Adjust the capture volume of local audio

In this example, `localAudioTrack` is the local audio track object you created.

```javascript
AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack().then(localAudioTrack => {
  // Reduce microphone volume by half
  localAudioTrack.setVolume(50);
  // Double the microphone volume
  localAudioTrack.setVolume(200);
  // Set the microphone volume to 0
  localAudioTrack.setVolume(0);
});
```
