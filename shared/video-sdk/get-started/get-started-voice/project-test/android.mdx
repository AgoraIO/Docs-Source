Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In `MainActivity` update the values for `myAppId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Fill in the same `channelName` you used to generate the token.

1. Enable developer options on your Android test device. Turn on USB debugging, connect the Android device to your development machine through a USB cable, and check that your device appears in the Android device options.

1. In Android Studio, click ![](/images/rtc-sdk/icon_android_gradle_sync.png) **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to resolve project dependencies and update the configuration.

1. After synchronization is successful, click ![](/images/rtc-sdk/icon_android_run.png) **Run app**. Android Studio starts compilation. After a few moments, the app is installed on your Android device.

5. Launch the App, grant recording and camera permissions. If you set the user role to host, you will see yourself in the local view.

6. On a second Android device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel and test the following use-cases:

    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the audience can hear the host.
