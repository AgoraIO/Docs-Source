 Profile CPU usage and memory consumption in TEN applications using gperftools for C++ and pprof for Go projects.
---

Performance profiling helps identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage in TEN applications. This guide covers how to profile CPU usage and memory consumption in TEN projects using profiling tools and analyze the resulting performance data.

## Go projects

TEN supports profiling for Go projects using the following tools:

- `gperftools`: Google Performance Tools for detailed CPU and heap memory profiling
- `pprof`: Go's built-in profiler for CPU and memory analysis

These tools provide detailed performance insights through data collection, analysis, and visualization options to help you optimize your TEN Go applications effectively.

### Install gperftools

Set up `gperftools` and create the required library links on Ubuntu:

```shell
apt update && apt install -y google-perftools

ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc.so.4 /usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so

ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libprofiler.so.0 /usr/lib/libprofiler.so
```

The symbolic links ensure that the profiling libraries are accessible in standard locations for your applications.

### Profile CPU usage with gperftools

To profile your program's CPU usage, follow these steps:

1. **Set up environment variables and run your program:**

   ```shell
   export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so
   export CPUPROFILE=/path/to/cpu

   exec /path/to/program
   ```

   When the program exits, CPU performance data is generated and saved to the `/path/to/cpu.0001.prof` file.

2. **Generate CPU performance data periodically (optional):**

   To generate CPU profiling data at regular intervals, set the `CPUPROFILE_FREQUENCY` environment variable. For example, to collect data every 30 seconds:

   ```shell
   LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so CPUPROFILE=/path/to/cpu CPUPROFILE_FREQUENCY=30 exec /path/to/program
   ```

#### Analyze CPU performance data

To analyze CPU performance data, run the following commands:

```shell
google-pprof --text /.../program /.../cpu.0001.prof > /.../cpu.0001.prof.txt

google-pprof --text --base=/.../cpu.0001.prof /.../program /.../cpu.0002.prof > /.../diff.txt
```

### Profile heap memory usage with gperftools

To profile your program's heap memory usage, run the following commands:

```shell
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so
export HEAPPROFILE=/.../heap
export HEAP_PROFILE_TIME_INTERVAL=30

exec /.../program
```

Set the `HEAP_PROFILE_TIME_INTERVAL` environment variable to periodically generate heap memory profiling data. All data is stored in the directory specified by `HEAPPROFILE`.

#### Analyze heap memory performance data

Each generated heap memory performance data file has a `.heap` extension. To analyze the data, convert the `.heap` files to a human-readable text format. For example, to convert a `.heap` file in `/.../heap` to text format, run the following command:

```shell
google-pprof --text /.../program /.../heap.0001.heap > /.../heap.0001.heap.txt
```

The performance data looks like this:

```text
Total: 19.7 MB
16.0  81.3%  81.3%     16.0  81.3% lws_zalloc
2.9  14.6%  95.9%      3.3   16.7% setAgoraStreamChannelParameters
...
```

You can also convert the `.heap` file to other formats such as PDF or SVG. For example, to convert a `.heap` file in `/.../heap` to PDF format, run the following command:

```shell
google-pprof --pdf /.../program /.../heap.0001.heap > /.../heap.0001.heap.pdf
```

The PDF output contains the same performance data as the text format but presented graphically.

You can also compare two sets of heap memory performance data. For example, to compare the data in `/.../heap.0001.heap` and `/.../heap.0002.heap`, run the following command:

```shell
google-pprof --pdf --base=/.../heap.0001.heap /.../program /.../heap.0002.heap > /.../diff.pdf
```

The PDF shows the differences in heap memory usage between the two data sets.

If you generate heap memory performance data periodically, use the `dump_heap_info_to_excel.py` script to analyze all heap memory performance data in a directory and generate an Excel file showing the memory usage trends. For example, to analyze all heap memory performance data in `/.../heap`, run the following command:

```shell
python3 tools/profiler/gperftools/dump_heap_info_to_excel.py -heap_dir=/.../heap -bin=/.../program -output=/.../heap.xlsx -sample_interval=30
```

The script generates raw performance data with symbols in the `/.../raw` directory, human-readable text performance data in the `/.../text` directory, and an Excel file in `/.../heap.xlsx`.

To plot a line chart to display the heap memory usage trends, use:

```shell
python3 tools/profiler/gperftools/draw_line_chart.py -excel_file=/.../heap.xlsx -output_file=/.../heap_line_chart.png -title=HEAP_MEM -x=time/s -y=total_heap_size/MB
```

### Profile with pprof

Use `pprof` to profile programs written in Go. The simplest way to profile a Go program is to use `pprof_app_go` as your TEN application. When activated, the app reads environment variables to decide whether to activate the `pprof` server and heap profiler.

```shell
export TEN_HEAP_DUMP_DIR=/data/prof
export HEAP_PROFILE_TIME_INTERVAL=30
export TEN_PROFILER_SERVER_PORT=6060
```

### Analyze pprof performance data

To convert heap performance data to a text format, use the following command:

```shell
python3 tools/profiler/pprof/dump_heap_files_to_text.py -heap_dir=/data/prof -text_dir=/data/text
```

To analyze all heap performance data and generate an Excel file, run:

```shell
python3 tools/profiler/pprof/dump_heap_info_to_excel.py -heap_dir=/data/prof -output=/data/heap.xlsx
```

To see a visual representation of Go heap performance data trends, plot a line chart:

```shell
python3 tools/profiler/gperftools/draw_line_chart.py -excel_file=/data/heap.xlsx -output_file=/data/heap_line_chart.png -title=HEAP_MEM -x=time/s -y=total_heap_size/MB
```
