<PlatformWrapper platform="web">


The <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> is the latest generation of the whiteboard SDK launched by Agora to help developers quickly build whiteboard applications. It simplifies the APIs of the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> and implements the core functionality with a default user interface (UI). In addition, the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> integrates [window-manager](https://github.com/netless-io/window-manager) and extensions from [netless-app](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app) to allow developers to easily add extensions to extend the functionality of their whiteboard applications. With the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" />, you do not need to learn the complex concepts of the interactive whiteboard; you can join a whiteboard room with a few lines of code and instantly use the rich editing tools to start real-time interactive collaboration.

## v1.0.0

This version was released on February xx, 2025.

#### New features

**Full package reference**

Starting from this version, Fastboard SDK adds full package files `@netless/fastboard/full` and `@netless/fastboard-react/full` to solve the dependency conflict problem. When using the full package reference, you do not need to install `@netless/window-manager` and `white-web-sdk` dependencies.

<Admonition type="info">
Using the full package reference, you need to remove the `@netless/window-manager`, `white-web-sdk`, and `jspdf` dependencies from your project.
</Admonition>

More information about full package and partial package reference, see [Fastboard installation and use](https://github.com/netless-io/fastboard/blob/main/README.md#install).

**High-performance whiteboard drawing tool**

This version adds the `appliance-plugin` plugin, which implements a high-performance whiteboard drawing tool and supports use in multi-window mode. After installing `@netless/appliance-plugin`, you can enable this plugin by using the `FastboardOptions.enableAppliancePlugin` or `managerConfig.supportAppliancePlugin` configuration item. In addition, when turning on appliance plugin, Fastboard UI adds a `laserPen` tool. For more information, see [`appliance-plugin`](../develop/appliance-plugin).

<Admonition type="info">
- `@netless/appliance-plugin` is a required external dependency and is not included in the full package. You must install it separately.
- To ensure handwriting is displayed correctly, enable the plug-in on all terminals (Web, Android, and iOS). If it is not enabled on a terminal, handwriting drawn on other terminals will not be displayed on that terminal.
- After enabling the plug-in, historical content on the whiteboard will still be visible but cannot be modified or upgraded. To avoid affecting the user experience, it is recommended to use the plug-in on a new whiteboard. After disabling the plug-in, any content drawn using it will be lost.
- The browser must fully support the Web API `OffscreenCanvas` to achieve the best performance and a complete teaching aids functionality experience.
</Admonition>

**Get whether the room is operable**

This version adds the `canOperate` method, which is used to get whether the room is in an operable state, that is, whether the current room is in interactive mode (`writable`) and the room connection state is connected (`connected`).

**New features for whiteboard tools**

This version adds new features to the following whiteboard toolsï¼š

- Pencil Tool: Added `toggleDottedLine` method to the Pencil tool to switch to drawing dotted lines.
- Pencil Eraser Tool: Added `setPencilEraserSize` method to the Pencil Eraser tool to change the size of the pencil eraser.

#### Improvements

**Custom UI component color**

The `ToolbarConfig` interface adds the `colors` property, which is used to set the color of the UI components. Starting from this version, the colors of the toolbar and floatbar are consistent by default, and the application uses a unified color set. You can also set the color set of the two by using [`joinRoomParams.floatbarOptions.colors`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/interactive-whiteboard-sdk/web/2.x/globals.html#floatbaroptions) and [`ToolbarConfig.colors`](../reference/uikit-sdk#toolbarconfig).

**Other improvements**

- This version updates @netless/window-manager to v1.0.0.
- In multi-window mode, the small window application inserted supports dragging the upper right corner of the window to adjust the window size.
- Supports accessing the value of the state after calling `destroy` to destroy the state (`state.value`).
- The `insertDocs` method supports passing in the response body of the static conversion with the `prefix` field.
- Added `crossOrigin` parameter to the `insertImage` method to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for inserted images.
- Added `jumpPage` method to jump to a specified whiteboard page.

#### Fixed issues

This version fixes the following issues:

- Using `insertDocs` to insert a document converted from a static file fails to return the `appId`.
- An error occurs when `FatboardUIConfig` is updated to `{ toolbar: undefined }`.
- Listening to some states (such as `camera.value`) returns an outdated value.
- Some components are invalid when the room connection state (`room.phase`) is not connected.

#### API Changes

**Added**

- `FastboardOptions.enableAppliancePlugin`
- `ToolbarConfig.colors`
- `canOperate`
- `toggleDottedLine`
- `setPencilEraserSize`
- Added a new parameter `crossOrigin` in `insertImage`

**Control PDF/PPTX docs**

This release adds the `dispatchDocsEvent` method to send events to specified PDF/PPTX docs inserted in the whiteboard. This enables page turning, page jumping, and slide animation playback to be controlled programmatically.

**Register Fastboard apps**

This release adds a new optional attribute `netlessApps` in the [`FastboardOptions`](https://docs.agora.io/en/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#fastboardoptions) interface to register built-in Fastboard official apps and custom Fastboard apps. See [netless-app](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app) for more official apps, and see [develop-apps](https://github.com/netless-io/window-manager/blob/master/docs/develop-app.md) for information on developing custom Fastboard apps.

You have two ways to register Fastboard apps:

- Before entering a whiteboard room:

    ```typescript
    import { register } from "@netless/fastboard";
    import MyApp from "my-app";

    register({ kind: MyApp.kind, src: MyApp });
    ```

- When calling `createFastboard`:

   ```typescript
   createFastboard({
     ..., // other configurations
     netlessApps: [MyApp],
   });
   ```

After registering the app, call the following interface to insert it when in a whiteboard room:

```typescript
fastboard.manager.addApp({ kind: MyApp.kind });
```

**Create UI components**

This release adds the  [`createUI`](https://docs.agora.io/en/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#createui) and [`createReplayUI`](https://docs.agora.io/en/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#createreplayui) methods to create a set of UI components for Fastboard and the playback mode, respectively.
