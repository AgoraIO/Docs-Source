RTC (Real-Time Communication) refers to real-time communication technology, that allows almost instant exchange of audio, video, and other data between the sender and the receiver.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDKs provide real-time audio and video interaction services, with multi-platform and multi-device support. This includes high-definition video calls, voice-only calls, interactive live streaming, as well as one-on-one and multi-group chats.

This article introduces the key processes and concepts you need to know to use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDKs.

## Using the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

<ProductWrapper notAllowed={["signaling","interactive-whiteboard","cloud-recording","iot","analytics","extensions-marketplace"]}>

To use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDKs, create an audio and video project in the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> first. See [Agora account management](../get-started/manage-agora-account) for details.

#### <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

<Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> is the main dashboard where you manage your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services. <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> provides an intuitive interface for developers to query and manage their <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account. After registering an <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}">Agora Account</Link>, you use the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to perform the following tasks:

-   Manage the account
-   Create and configure <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services
-   Get an App ID
-   Manage members and roles
-   Check call quality and usage
-   Check bills and make payments
-   Access product resources

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> also provides RESTful APIs that you use to implement features such as creating a project and fetching usage numbers programmatically.

## General concepts

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the following basic concepts:

### App ID

The App ID is a random string generated within <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> when you create a new project. You can create multiple projects in your account; each project has a different App ID. This App ID enables your app users to communicate securely with each other. When you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, you pass the App ID as an argument. The App ID is also used to create the authentication tokens that ensure secure communication in a channel. You <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">retrieve your App ID</Link> using <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses this App ID to identify each app, provide billing and other statistical data services.

<ProductWrapper notAllowed={["extensions-marketplace","agora-analytics","video-calling", "voice-calling",
  "interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming","signaling"]}>

For applications requiring high security in a production environment, you must choose an **App ID + Token** mechanism for [user authentication](../get-started/authentication-workflow) when creating a new project. Without an authentication token, your environment is open to anyone with access to your App ID.

### App certificate

An App certificate is a string generated by <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to enable token authentication. It is required for generating a <Vg k="VSDK" /> or <Vg k="MESS" /> authentication token.

<ProductWrapper notAllowed={["extensions-marketplace","agora-analytics","video-calling", "voice-calling",

</ProductWrapper>

### Token

A token is a dynamic key that is used by the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> authentication server to check user permissions. You use <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to generate a temporary token for testing purposes during the development process. In a production environment, you implement a token server in your security infrastructure to control access to your channels.

After obtaining the App ID, App Certificate, and Token in the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, you can start implementing basic audio and video communication in your app.

### Channel

<ProductWrapper product="signaling">

A data transfer management mechanism for passing data from one device to another. Any user who subscribes to or joins a channel can receive messages or events transmitted in that channel. Clients can subscribe to or join multiple channels at the same time.

<Vg k="MESS" /> includes the following types of channels:

| Channel type	| Main features	| Applicable use-case|
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Message       | Follows the industry-standard pub/sub model. Channels do not need to be created in advance, and there is no upper limit on the number of publishers and subscribers in a channel.|Multi-device management and command exchange in the IoT industry, location tracking in smart devices, etc.|
| Stream        |Follows the chat room model. Users need to join the channel to send and receive event notifications. Messages are managed and delivered through topics, and a single channel allows up to 1000 users to join at the same time. Supports channel sharing and synchronous transmission of audio and video data.|High-frequency and large concurrent data transmission or co-channel and synchronous transmission with audio and video data, such as metaverse, cloud games, etc.|

</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="signaling">

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the *channel name* to identify a channel. Users who specify the same *channel name* join a common channel and interact with each other. A channel is created when the first user joins. It ceases to exist when the last user leaves.

You create a channel by calling the methods for transmitting real-time data. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses different channels to transmit different types of data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel transmits audio or video data, while the <Vg k="MESS" /> channel transmits messaging or signaling data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> and <Vg k="MESS" /> channels are independent of each other.

Additional components provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, such as On-Premise Recording and Cloud Recording, join the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel and provide real-time recording, transmission acceleration, media playback, and content moderation.

### Channel profile

The SDK applies different optimization methods according to the selected channel profile. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> supports the following channel profiles:

| Channel profile    | Description     |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| `COMMUNICATION`      | This profile is suitable for one-on-one or group calls, where all users in the channel talk freely.      |
| `LIVE_BROADCASTING` | In a live streaming channel, users have two client roles: *host* and *audience*. The *host* sends and receives audio or video, while the *audience* only receives audio or video with the sending function disabled. |

### Stream

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="flexible-classroom">
A stream is a sequence of digitally-encoded coherent signals that contains audio or video data. Users in a channel [publish](#publish) local streams and [subscribe](#subscribe) to remote streams from other users.

</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="flexible-classroom">

Streams in Flexible Classroom can be understood as audio and video streams and permission to send audio and video streams. Developers can call APIs to give a user permission to perform a specific operation. A user can have multiple streams. For example, a user can have both permission to send audio and video streams captured by local devices and permission to send the video stream from screen capturing.

Developers can call `addCoHost` to create a stream for a user and gives the user permission to send the audio or video stream. The Flexible Classroom cloud service automatically generates a stream ID. Developers can call `removeCoHost` to permanently destroy a stream and remove permission.

</ProductWrapper>

### Publish

Publishing is the act of sending a user’s audio or video data to the channel. Usually, the published stream is created by the audio data sampled from a microphone or the video data captured by a camera. You can also publish media streams from other sources, such as an online music file or the user’s screen.
After successfully publishing a stream, the SDK continues sending media data to other users in the channel. By publishing the local stream and subscribing to remote streams, users communicate with each other in real-time.

### Subscribe

Subscribing is the act of receiving media streams published by remote users to the channel. A user receives audio and video data from other users by subscribing to one or more of their streams. You either directly play the subscribed streams or process incoming data for other purposes such as recording or capturing screenshots.

</ProductWrapper>

### User ID

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="signaling">
A User ID (UID) identifies a user in a channel. Each user in a channel should have a unique user ID. If you do not specify a user ID when the user joins a channel, a UID is automatically generated and assigned to the user.
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="signaling">
A user ID (UID) identifies a user in a channel. A user is a person or entity that logs into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
Each user in a [project](#app-id) must have a globally unique UID.

The same UID cannot log in to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> from multiple devices at the same time. If <Vpl k="CLIENT"
/>s  with the same UID logs in to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> that logged in first
is disconnected and sent an event notification.

The UID is used for billing and online status notifications.
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="flexible-classroom">

### User

Users are the initiators of behavior in Flexible Classroom. A user has the following properties:

- The user ID: The globally unique identifier of a user in Flexible Classroom.
- The user name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a nickname, Chinese name, or English name.
- The user role: Users have different roles in a classroom, such as the teacher, student, teaching assistant, and audience.
- Customized user properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize user properties, such as setting the user avatar or gender.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method.

</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="signaling">
### User role

A user role is used to define whether users in the channel have permission to publish streams. There are two user roles:

- Host: A user who can publish streams in a channel.
- Audience: A user who cannot publish streams in a channel. Users with this role can only subscribe to remote audio and video streams.
</ProductWrapper>

### Connection (RtcConnection)

The connection between the SDK and the channel. When you need to publish or receive multiple streams in multiple channels, a connection is used to specify the target channel.

## Classroom concepts

### Room

Rooms in Flexible Classroom are just like the physical classrooms in schools. Classes offered by different teachers with diversified teaching materials can take place in the same room at different times. A school can have different types of classrooms, such as traditional classrooms, laboratories, and multimedia classrooms. Similarly, the rooms of Flexible Classroom can be divided into several types. A room has the following properties:

- The room ID: The globally unique identifier of a room.
- The room name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a Chinese name or an English name.
- The room type: Agora supports three room types: One-to-one Classroom, Small Classroom, and Lecture Hall. These room types vary in features and the upper limit on th number of users.
- Customized room properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize room properties, such as setting the room status and room label.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. A room is created automatically with the parameters (the room ID, room name, and room type) set by the first user joining the room. To join the same room with the first user, users need to call the `launch` method and pass in the same parameters (room ID, room name, and room type). Agora automatically destroys the room one hour after all users leave the room.

### Class

Classes in Flexible Classroom are just like the actual classes offered by different teachers in offline teaching use-cases. A class has the following properties:

- The class state: A class has three states: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Ended".
- The start time: The start time of a class. Before the start time, the class state is "Not Started". After the start time, the class state changes to "In Progress".
- The class duration: How long a class lasts. After the class duration, the class state changes to "Ended".
- The run-late time: How long a room can be open after the class ends. After the run-late time, the room is closed. Users are kicked out of the room immediately, and other users can no longer join the room.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. The class properties are set by the first user joining the room.
