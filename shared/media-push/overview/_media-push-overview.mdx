## Introduction
**Media Push** is a service provided by Agora for audio or video live streaming. You can use this service to subscribe to the media stream in a channel, transcode the media stream, and then push it to the CDN through standard protocols (such as RTMP) in order to enrich the distribution channels of live streaming.

You can push a media stream to the CDN through the RESTful API or through the API provided by the [Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> v3.x](/3.x/interactive-live-streaming/advanced-features/media-push).
