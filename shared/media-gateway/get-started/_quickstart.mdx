<Vg k="MG" /> enables users to push content to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> using standard streaming
protocols such as RTMP and SRT. The channel host automatically publishes this streamed content to the correct
channel. Possible use cases are:

* **Enrich the viewing experience with commentary**: Seamlessly inject high-definition video source streams into
interactive channels to enhance the viewing experience. Multiple anchors from different locations watch and interact
in real-time, adding depth to the media with their commentary.

* **Low-latency distribution scenarios**: Distribute content to viewers in a faster and more stable way than using a
Content Deliver Network (CDN). In scenarios such as online auctions and bidding platforms, bidders receive a real-time
video feed enabling them to swiftly place their bids.

* **Recording to live broadcast**: Enhance content quality and reduce live production complexity by injecting
prerecorded media into a live broadcast. For example, a teacher records aspects of a lesson in advance and adds it
to a live classroom. All students and teaching assistants watch the teacher's lecture, and interact in real-time.

* **Avoid interruptions due to host switching**: Background music is played continuously in a chat room without
interruptions if the host leaves the channel.

## Understand the tech

Using [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest), you generate a streaming key. This key allows you to push online media streams as live video source streams into Agora channels.

![Flow diagram](/images/media-gateway/media-gateway-flow.svg)

With <Vg k="MG" />, you can employ advanced transcoding capabilities on media streams for enhanced distribution. To enable and configure transcoding options, you use the [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest). When transcoding is enabled, you can set parameters such as resolution, frame rate, bit rate, and whether to enable video streams with high and low resolutions.

## Setup

To activate the <Vg k="MG" />, contact [Agora support](mailto:support@agora.io). When you activate <Vg k="MG" />, you specify your access area to optimize the transmission quality of the media stream.

## Implementation

The [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest) supports the following interfaces:

| API | Description |
|:----|:------------------------|
| `Create` | Acquire a stream key. You use the stream key to `Configure`, `Query` and `Delete` the stream. |
| `Configure` | Set the video and audio transcoding configuration.<br />By default, the video stream is pushed directly to the Agora channel without transcoding. If you need to transcode, use this interface to set the relevant parameters.|
| `Query` | Query information about stream keys, such as the bound UID, the bound channel name, and validity. |
| `Delete` | Destroy a stream key. |

To use the <Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API and obtain the relevant code, refer to the [API reference](../../api-reference?platform=rest). If you need to push multiple streams to the same channel, use a unique uid to generate each stream key.

The stream key generation method depends on whether you use the Agora domain name or a custom domain name. To use the Agora domain name, create a stream key using the [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest).

#### Generate the stream key locally

When using your own domain name for streaming, the stream key can be generated locally.
Contact [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) to bind your custom domain name. To generate a stream key locally, you use the following information:

* The App Id of the Agora project from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/).
* The App certificates corresponding to your App Id.
* A channel name.
* The user Id of the anchor in the Agora channel.
* The effective duration (seconds) of the stream keys.

The following Node.js sample code demonstrates how to generate a stream key:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const msgpack = require('msgpack-lite');

appcert = "" // Your App certificate from Agora console
channel = ""; // A Video SDK channel name
uid = ""; // The uid of the anchor in the channel
expiresAfter = 86400; // Valid duration of stream key (seconds)

const expiresAt = Math.floor(Date. now() / 1000) + expiresAfter;

const rtcInfo = {
   C: channel,
   U: uid,
   E: expiresAt,
};

// Serialize using msgpack
const data = msgpack.encode(rtcInfo);

// Randomly generate an initialization vector
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

// Use App certificate as encryption key
const key = Buffer.from(appcert, 'hex');

// Create an AES-128 CTR encryptor
const encrypter = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-128-ctr', key, iv);

// Encrypt the data
const encrypted = Buffer.concat([iv, encrypter.update(data), encrypter.final()]);

// Base64 conversion
const streamkey = encrypted.toString('base64').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/\=+$/, '');

console.log(`streamkey is ${streamkey}`);
```

## Test Media Gateway

This section shows you how to test Agora <Vg k="MG" /> using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), a free and open-source, cross-platform streaming app. Take the following steps to start streaming using OBS Studio:

1. [Download](https://obsproject.com/download) and install OBS studio. 

1. From the main screen, select **Settings** and switch to the **Stream** tab.

1. Fill in the following information:

    ![Server settings](/images/media-gateway/obs-server-setting.png)

    * **Service**: From the dropdown list, select `Custom...`

    * **Server**: Enter the scheme `rtmp://`, followed by the unified Agora domain name, or your own domain name.
    The unified Agora domain name is `rtls-ingress-prod-<region>.agoramdn.com`.    Replace `<region>` with the code for your geographical region. You also need to append `/live` after the domain name. 
    
        For example: `rtmp://rtls-ingress-prod-na.agoramdn.com/live`
    
        The supported regions and their codes are:

        * `na`: North America
        * `eu`: Europe
        * `ap`: Asia, except Mainland China
        * `cn`: Mainland China       

        To use your own domain name, please contact [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) for configuration. 

    * **Stream key**: A valid stream key, acquired using the [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest) or generated locally, that corresponds to your server domain name.


1. Set streaming options to avoid B-frames in source streams:
    
    To avoid compatibility issues with Agora viewer on the web when transcoding is not enabled, and the source stream contains B-frames, use one of the following methods in OBS studio:

    * Add a `x264` encoding parameter
        
        In OBS Studio, go to **Settings > Output > Encoder Settings**, and set the **x264 Options** to `bframes=0`
        
        ![zero B frames](/images/media-gateway/obs-setting-bframes.png)


    * Add a **Tune** parameter
        
        In OBS Studio, go to **Settings > Output > Encoder Settings**, and set the **Tune** parameter to `zerolatency`

        ![Zero latency](/images/media-gateway/obs-setting-zerolatency.png)

    Save the configuration and return to the main screen.

1. Under **Sources**, press **+** to add a new source then select **Media Source** from the menu. Type in a name for your source and **Browse** to select a video file.

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for the same channel name you used to generate the stream key but use a different `uid`.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

1. In OBS Studio, press **Start Streaming** to begin streaming to your Agora Channel.

    You see a video stream displayed in the channel, with the `uid` you used to generate the stream key.

1. Use the `Configure`, `Query`, and `Delete` [<Vg k="MG" /> RESTful API](../../api-reference?platform=rest) interfaces to manage your stream.
