### Known issues and limitations

Starting from v2.2.0, the Signaling SDK and Video SDK (version 4.3.0 or later) both include the `aosl.xframework` library. If you use both SDKs, take the following steps to avoid conflicts:

- If you manually integrate the SDK through CDN, manually delete the older version of the `aosl.xframework` library;
- If you integrate the SDK using a dependency management tool, such as Maven or CocoaPods, ensure that the newer version of the `aosl.xframework` library is included in your project.

For more information, see [How do I handle issues when integrating the Signaling SDK and Video SDK simultaneously?](../../help/integration-issues/rtm2_rtc_integration_issue)

- Signaling SDK v2.2.2 `aosl.xframework` version: 1.0.11.
- Signaling SDK v2.2.1 `aosl.xframework` version: 1.0.11.
- Signaling SDK v2.2.0 `aosl.xframework` version: 1.0.0.17.

### v2.2.2

v2.2.2 was released on November 6, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

1. SNAPSHOT state trigger timing change

    This release changes the trigger timing of the `SNAPSHOT` event in the Presence event. Now, as long as the user is in the channel, they may receive the `SNAPSHOT` event again; after receiving it, users can update their full information to avoid state synchronization issues caused by exceptions.

1. Lock timeout calculation rule change

    This release changes the calculation rule of the lock (Lock) timeout. Starting from this version, the lock timeout is calculated from the time when the server determines that the user is offline.

#### New features

1. SDK connection state change reason

    This release adds the <code>{enumv.linkstatereason[props.ag_platform]}</code> enumeration class to the `LinkStateEvent` of the SDK connection state, to report the reason for the connection state change.

#### Improvements

This release improves the performance of the basic messaging service during exceptions, preventing service unavailability caused by the failure of some services.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:
- In some scenarios, incorrect token types cause exceptions.
- In some scenarios, users may receive repeated offline notifications from the same user who has gone offline.
- After logging in from different devices with the same UID, the connection state may be abnormal.
- When setting the Presence state frequently, data may be abnormal.
- When the specified service is not activated, joining a channel does not return an error.
- In some scenarios, abnormal property values may cause crashes.

### v2.2.1

v2.2.1 was released on August 9, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release optimizes the implementation of the following features, which involves renaming, deleting, or modifying the behavior of some APIs. To ensure the proper functioning of your project, modify your implementation after upgrading the SDK.

- Removes the `createMetadata` method. Refer to the sample code below to modify your implementation:

  ```objc
  // Before v2.2.1
  AgoraRtmMetadata* metadata = [[rtm getStorage] createMetadata];
  ```

  ```objc
  // v2.2.1 or later
  AgoraRtmMetadata* metadata = [[AgoraRtmMetadata alloc] init];
  ```

- Removes the `AgoraRtmStateItem` class and changes the type of the following parameters from `NSArray<AgoraRtmStateItem *>` to `NSDictionary`:
  - The `items` parameter of the [`setState`](../reference/api#presencesetstatepropsag_platform) method.
  - The `states` parameter of the [`PresenceEvent`](../reference/api#configpresenceeventpropsag_platform) class.
  - The `states` parameter of the [`UserState`](../reference/api#presencegetstatepropsag_platform) class.

- Adds <code>{enumv.reasoncertification[props.ag_platform]}(22)</code> in [<code>{enumv.connectionreason[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#enumvconnectionreasonpropsag_platform). The values of <code>{enumv.reasonstreamchannel[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{enumv.reasoninconsistentappid[props.ag_platform]}</code> change to 23 and 24, respectively.

#### New features

1. VisionOS support

    This release adds support for VisionOS. For the minimum supported version and target architecture, see [Supported platforms](supported-platforms). This release also changes the package name from `AgoraRtm_iOS` to `AgoraRtm`. After upgrading the SDK, if you use Cocoapods to integrate the SDK, modify the `Podfile` file as follows:

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '11.0'
    target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtm', '2.2.0'
    end
    ```

1. Private deployment capability

    This release adds the `privateConfig` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configrtmpropsag_platform) to set private deployment. See [Private deployment configuration](../get-started/client-configuration?#private-deployment-configuration).

1. Heartbeat interval configuration

    This release adds the `heartbeatInterval` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configrtmpropsag_platform) to set the interval at which the SDK sends heartbeat packets to the server. See [Heartbeat interval and presence timeout parameters](../core-functionality/connection-management#heartbeat-interval-and-presence-timeout-parameters).

1. Dual environment configuration

    This release adds the `protocolType` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configrtmpropsag_platform) to set the network transport protocol. See [Connection protocol](../get-started/client-configuration?#private-deployment-configuration).

1. User channel

    This release adds the <code>{enumv.channeltypeuser[props.ag_platform]}</code> type in [<code>{enumv.channeltype[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#enumvchanneltypepropsag_platform) for sending messages to specific users. This feature can replace the peer-to-peer messaging feature in v1.

1. Quiet mode configuration

    This release adds <code>{enumv.subscribechannelfeaturebequiet[props.ag_platform]}</code> in [<code>{enumv.subscribechannelfeature[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#channelsubscribepropsag_platform), and <code>{enumv.joinchannelfeaturebequiet[props.ag_platform]}</code> in [<code>{enumv.joinchannelfeature[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#channeljoinpropsag_platform) to enable quiet mode when subscribing or joining a channel. Once you enable the quiet mode, other users in the channel cannot receive your presence event notifications.

#### Improvements

1. Connection state management

    This release deprecates the <code>{config.onconnection[props.ag_platform]}</code> callback and adds the [<code>{config.onlinkstateevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#event-listeners) callback instead. See [Connection management](../core-functionality/connection-management) for details.

1. `AgoraRtmPresenceEventTypeRemoteStateChanged` event notification logic

    This release changes the triggering logic of the `AgoraRtmPresenceEventTypeRemoteStateChanged` event. When a user sets or modifies multiple key-value pairs at once, other users in the channel receive only one event notification.

1. Support for event notification timestamps

    This release adds a new `timestamp` parameter in the following data structures to report the timestamp of the triggered event notification:

    - [<code>{config.messageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configmessageeventpropsag_platform)
    - [<code>{config.presenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configpresenceeventpropsag_platform)
    - [<code>{config.topicevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configtopiceventpropsag_platform)
    - [<code>{config.storageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configstorageeventpropsag_platform)
    - [<code>{config.lockevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configlockeventpropsag_platform)

1. Optimized API behavior

    This release improves the behavior of the following APIs:
    - [<code>{config.login[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configloginpropsag_platform)
      - Before v2.2.1: The SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method, or passing an empty string in the `token` parameter.
      - v2.2.1 or later: The SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method without the need for additional calls to <code>{config.logout[props.ag_platform]}</code> in between. Additionally, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK uses the App ID you provided during initialization as a replacement for the token.
    - [<code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#channelsubscribepropsag_platform)
      - Before than v2.2.1: The SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method.
      - v2.2.1 or later: The SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method.
    - [<code>{channel.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#channeljoinpropsag_platform)
      - Before v2.2.1: The SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method, or passing an empty string in the `token` parameter.
      - v2.2.1 or later: The SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method. Additionally, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK uses the app ID you provided during initialization as a replacement for the token.

1. Range of `presenceTimeout`

    This release changes the range of the `presenceTimeout` parameter in the [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](../reference/api#configrtmpropsag_platform) from [10, 300] to [5, 300].

1. Others

    This release also enhances the underlying algorithm capability to improve data synchronization speed.

#### Fixed issues

    This release fixed the issue that remote users occasionally did not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypeleave[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification when the local user directly called the <code>{config.logout[props.ag_platform]}</code> method without calling the <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> method.

### v2.1.12

v2.1.12 was released on July 2, 2024.

#### Improvements

This release includes the following improvements:

- For data synchronization errors caused by network issues, this release introduces a user logout mechanism, which ensures that the SDK automatically logs out of the Signaling system.
- Unsubscribing from a message channel during network disconnection will no longer return an error.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- During a disconnection with the Signaling system under poor network conditions, the user experienced errors when unsubscribing from a message channel.
- Under poor network conditions, the user occasionally failed to receive callbacks after a successful login.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the user occasionally could not receive the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the SDK occasionally failed to restore subscription relationships in the stream channel.
- Occasional failure to receive topic messages from web clients.

### v2.1.11

v2.1.11 was released on May 13, 2024.

#### Improvements

**New privacy information file**

    To meet Apple's security and compliance requirements for app distribution, this release adds a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file. It contains API call instructions for accessing or using user data within the SDK, as well as descriptions of the data types collected by the SDK.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Information">
    If you need to distribute an app with SDK versions earlier than v2.1.10 on the Apple App Store, you need to manually add the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file to your Xcode project. See [How can I add a privacy manifest to my iOS app?](../../help/other-issues/ios_privacy_manifest)
    </Admonition>

**Other improvements**

This release optimizes the response mechanism when subscribing to channels with the <code>{enumv.subscribechannelfeaturepresence[props.ag_platform]}</code> setting or joining channels with the <code>{enumv.joinchannelfeaturepresence[props.ag_platform]}</code> setting. If the user does not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypesnap[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification within 5 seconds, the SDK will report the <code>{code.presencenotready[props.ag_platform]}</code> error code in the `completionBlock` parameter.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- In specific scenarios, after logging out of the Signaling system and logging back in, occasional failures occurred when subscribing to channels with the <code>{enumv.subscribechannelfeaturepresence[props.ag_platform]}</code> setting or joining channels with the <code>{enumv.joinchannelfeaturepresence[props.ag_platform]}</code> setting.
- In cases where the connection was lost due to network issues and then restored, if the local user actively called the <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to leave the channel, a remote user occasionally did not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypetimeout[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of the <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- Occasional failures occurred when frequently calling the <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{channel.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> methods.

### v2.1.10

v2.1.10 was released on March 11, 2024.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sending messages frequently, message sending occasionally timed out.
- After calling `renewToken` to renew the token, some services were not functioning correctly, resulting in unexpected disconnection.

### v2.1.9

v2.1.9 was released on February 22, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release improves message publishing options as follows:

- Removes the `sendTs` parameter, and adds the `channelType` parameter in `AgoraRtmPublishOptions`. See details in [`AgoraRtmPublishOptions`](../reference/api/#messagepublishpropsag_platform).
- Modifies the type of the `options` parameter in the `publishTopicMessage` method from `AgoraRtmPublishOptions` to `AgoraRtmTopicMessageOptions`. See details in [`AgoraRtmTopicMessageOptions`](../reference/api/#topicpublishpropsag_platform).

#### Improvements

This release adds the following improvements:

- Adds error codes: `AgoraRtmErrorInvalidChannelType`, `AgoraRtmErrorInvalidEncryptionParameter`, and `AgoraRtmErrorOperationRateExceedLimitation`. For error code descriptions and solutions, see [Error Codes](../reference/api#error-codes-table).
- Optimizes the handling logic for expired user status data during reconnection.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The initialization process did not return a failure when the `encryptionKdfSalt` parameter length was not 32 bytes.
- Occasional crashes occurred when calling the `getOnlineUsers` method to retrieve paginated results.
- The memory leak issue during initialization.

### v2.1.7

v2.1.7 was released on January 22, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

1. Initialization parameters

    To remind users to set the required parameters during initialization, this release adds the following methods:

    - The `init` method in `AgoraRtmMetadata`, which prevents users from initializing without providing the required parameters.
    - The `init` and `initWithServer` methods in `AgoraRtmProxyConfig`, which require users to provide the `server`, `port`, and `proxyType` parameters during initialization.
    - The `init` and `initWithAppId` methods in `AgoraRtmClientConfig`, which require users to provide the `appId` and `userId` parameters during initialization.

1. Channel options

    This release adds the following changes to the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption` and `AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions` classes:

    - Removes the `withMetadata`, `withPresence`, and `withLock` parameters from the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption` class, and adds a `features` parameter as a replacement. You can set one or more event notifications in the `features` parameter based on your needs.
    - Removes the `withMessage`, `withMetadata`, `withPresence`, and `withLock` parameters from the `AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions` class, and adds a `features` parameter as a replacement. You can set one or more event notifications in the `features` parameter based on your needs.

    This release also improves the performace of setting the presence event notification in `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption`.

1. Naming changes

    This release renames the following callbacks:

    | Before v2.1.6 | v2.1.6 |
    | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
    | `onMessageEvent` | `didReceiveMessageEvent` |
    | `onPresenceEvent` | `didReceivePresenceEvent` |
    | `onLockEvent` | `didReceiveLockEvent` |
    |`onStorageEvent` | `didReceiveStorageEvent`|
    | `onTopicEvent` | `didReceiveTopicEvent` |
    |`onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` | `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` |
    |`connectionStateChanged` | `connectionChangedToState` |

    This release also renames the `items` parameter of the `removeState` method to `keys`, and changes the type of the `areaCode` parameter from `unsigned int` to `AgoraRtmAreaCode`.

#### New features

1. Stream Channel

    Experience seamless, delay-free data flow from one point to another. Stream channel solution refers to a real-time data pipeline that enables the uninterrupted flow of data from one point to another without delay or latency.

2. Pub/Sub

    Embrace asynchronous messaging, enabling instant communication between publishers and subscribers without the need for immediate responses. The pub/sub model is a messaging pattern used in real-time messaging solutions where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive messages from the channels they are subscribed to.

3. Topic

    Effectively manage data streams with topics, enabling seamless communications between users. Topic serves as a data flow management mechanism in the stream channel. It enables users to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events of data streams. Topics allow users to register as message publishers, send messages, and receive messages from subscribed publishers in a channel.

4. Storage

    Storage is important in signaling solutions to ensure reliable message delivery and prevent message loss or drop.

5. Removing Event Listeners

    This release adds the removeEventListener method. You can use it to remove a specified event listener.

6. Interval Mode

    This release supports the interval mode of presence function. When the number of online users in a channel exceeds the specified Announce Max value, the channel enters the interval mode. The SDK triggers the presence event notification at regular intervals and provides aggregated incremental information about user join, leave, timeout, and state changes in the interval property. For more details, see [Interval Mode](../reference/api#presence-event-types).

7. Multiple ways to add event listeners

    This release adds the `addDelegate` and `removeDelegate` methods. In addition to adding or removing an event listener object during initialization, you can also call the new methods to add or remove one or more event listener objects at any time during the app's lifecycle.

8. Locks

    Implement locks to maintain the sequence of messages, ensuring your data is processed in a specific order, preventing any data conflicts. When a client accesses a resource, it can acquire a lock on that resource to prevent other clients from accessing it.

#### Improvements

1. Message sending

    This release adds two new methods, `publish` and `publishTopicMessage`, which have the same name as existing methods. Additionally, this release changes the type of the `message` parameter in the original methods. See details as follows:

    ```objc
    // Before v2.1.6
    // The type of the message parameter is NSObject
    // The NSObject type supports passing both string and binary messages
    - (void) publish: (NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
                message: (NSObject* _Nonnull)message
                withOption: (AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
                completion: (AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock;

    - (void) publishTopicMessage: (NSObject * _Nonnull) message
                inTopic: (NSString * _Nonnull) topic
                withOption:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable) options
                completion: (AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock;
    ```

    ```objc
    // v2.1.6
    // The type of the message parameter is NSString or NSData
    // The NSString type only supports passing string data
    // The NSData type only supports passing binary data

    // publish[1/2]
    - (void) publish:(NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
            message:(NSString* _Nonnull)message
            option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
        completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publish[2/2]
    - (void) publish:(NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
                data:(NSData* _Nonnull)data
            option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
        completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publishTopicMessage[1/2]
    - (void) publishTopicMessage:(NSString * _Nonnull)topic
                        message:(NSString * _Nonnull)message
                        option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable)options
                    completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publishTopicMessage[2/2]
    - (void) publishTopicMessage:(NSString * _Nonnull)topic
                            data:(NSData * _Nonnull)data
                        option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable)options
                    completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock
    ```

1. Message receiving

    This release removes the `getData` method, `getType` method, and `AgoraRtmMessageType` class in the `AgoraRtmMessage` class, and adds the `rawData` and `stringData` properties instead. You can use the `rawData` property to receive binary messages, and the `stringData` property to receive string messages.

1. Response and error message optimization

    This release changes the information returned by the `completionBlock` callback function in various methods:

    - If the method call is successful, the `response` parameter returns the corresponding data, and the `errorInfo` parameter returns `nil`.
    - If the method call fails, the `response` parameter returns `nil`, and the `errorInfo` parameter returns the corresponding error message.

    Additionally, this release adds an `error` parameter to the `initWithConfig` and `createStreamChannel` methods. If the method call fails, you can see the output error description in the `error` parameter.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional inability to log out of the RTM system when the network status changed.
- Occasional inability to log in to the RTM system after logging out when the network status changed.
- When the network was disconnected, users occasionally did not receive the `Snapshot` event notification due to that the app did not clear data.
- When a user joined a channel and switched the app to the background and then back to the foreground, the SDK occasionally triggered the `REMOTE_JOIN` event notification multiple times.
