### Send a call invitation

The steps to send a call invitation are as follows:

1.  The caller creates the `LocalInvitation` by calling `createLocalInvitation`; at the same time, the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` begins.

2.  The caller sends a call invitation by calling `sendLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` begins as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationReceived` callback, and then the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationReceivedByPeer` callback.

### Cancel a call invitation

The caller cancels the call invitation by calling `cancelLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationCanceled` callback. And then the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationCanceled` callback.

### Accept a call invitation

The callee gets RemoteInvitation from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and accepts the call invitation by calling `acceptRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationAccepted` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationAccepted` callback.

### Refuse a call invitation

The callee gets RemoteInvitation from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and refuses the call invitation by calling `refuseRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationRefused` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationRefused` callback.
