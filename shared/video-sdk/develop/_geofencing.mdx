When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable Geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for Geofencing:

## Reference

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

- When the user's location is different from the specified region, the public network spanning between the user's location and the specified region might have a poor quality, which can make the audio and video experience less than optimal.
- To specify multiple regions for the connection, you can perform bitwise operations on the area codes. To include a region, use the `|` operator, to exclude a region  use `^`.
