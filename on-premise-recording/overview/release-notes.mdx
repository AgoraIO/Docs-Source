## Overview

The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK records communication and interactive live streaming
contents based on the Agora Native SDK.

### Compatibility

This component package is compatible with the following SDKs:

| SDK | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Agora Native SDK | The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK is compatible with the Agora Native SDK v1.7.0 or later. If, for example, any user in the channel uses the Agora Native SDK v1.6, the whole channel cannot record. |
| The Agora Web SDK | The On-Premise Recording SDK is compatible with the Agora Web SDK v1.12.0 or later. |

### Known Issues and Limitation

-   When you record using an Android client, the image is turned upside down when you switch from a front-facing camera to a rear one.
-   If the user calls the <code>leaveChannel</code> method in the channel to stop recording, the recording file ends with a period of silence determined by the <code>idleLimitSec</code> field set for the configuration when calling the <code>joinChannel</code> method.
-   The recorded voice or video files are not encrypted. To be compliant with HIPAA, encrypt the disk with a disk
encryption tool, such as cryptsetup.


> The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK supports both Java and C++ from v2.2.0.


## v3.0.6
v3.0.6 was released on May 18, 2021.

#### New feature

**AES-GCM encryption**

For use-cases requiring high security, to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data and to improve the computational efficiency of the data encryption, this release adds the following options in `decryptionMode`:

- `"aes-128-gcm"`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.
- `"aes-256-gcm"`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key.

**MP3 format in composite recording mode**


v3.0.6 adds `Audio_Only_Record` and `Secondary_Recorder` in `cfgFilePath` to get a MP3 file after a composite recording. See [Record a Call](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_cmd_cpp#composite-recording-mode) and <Link to="{{global.OPREC_SDK_API_CPP}}/structagora_1_1recording_1_1_recording_config.html#afd78b4f136e4deeaf310061606e7bc62">cfgFilePath</Link> for details.

#### Improvements

- You can set the sample rate of the raw audio data in PCM format (`getAudioFrame` is 2 or 3) through the `cfgFilePath` parameter. See [Record a Call](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/recording_cmd_cpp#设置录制格式) for details.



- Optimize the sensitivity and accuracy of `onActiveSpeaker` and `onAudioVolumeIndication` callbacks. 
- You can call <Link to= "{{global.OPREC_SDK_API_CPP}}/structagora_1_1recording_1_1_recording_config.html#a9912a5fc16b3f0737290c618846d76a7">mixedVideoAudio</Link>  to get a MP4 file after a composite recording or an individual recording without transcoding.

  | Earlier than v3.0.6                                          | v3.0.6 or later                                              |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Generates video files in TS format during the recording. When the recording ends, you can use the transcoding script to convert the TS file to MP4 format. | Generates video files in TS format and MP4 format during the recording. |

#### API changes

Adds enumerators for `MIXED_AV_CODEC_TYPE`：
`AV_CODEC_INDIVIDUAL_TS_ONLY`: Generates video files in TS format, and audio files in AAC format in the individual recording mode.
`AV_CODEC_INDIVIDUAL_TS_AND_MP4`: Generates video files in TS format and MP4 format, and audio files in AAC format in the individual recording mode.
`AV_CODEC_MIXED_TS_ONLY`: Mixes the audio and video in real time into an TS file in the composite recording mode.
`AV_CODEC_MIXED_TS_AND_MP4`: Mixes the audio and video in real time into an TS file and an MP4 file in the composite recording mode.



#### Issues fixed

Fix the issue that the transcoding script does not support UIDs with underscores, resulting in parsing errors.

## v3.0.5

v3.0.5 was released on January 13, 2021.

#### New feature

This release adds `VIDEO_JPG_FILE` in `VIDEO_FRAME_TYPE` to get video data in JPG file format. 

#### Improvements

- To enable faster playback of the MP4 file generated from the recording, this release moves the moov atom to the start of the MP4 file, which allows for playback of the file during buffering.
- This release removes the restriction that you cannot get the raw audio data and raw video data at the same time from an individual recording session.

#### Issues fixed

 This release fixed the following issues:

- The captured screenshots in JPG format had rotation information missing when the video decoding format was set as `VIDEO_FORMAT_JPG_VIDEO_FILE_TYPE`.
- Crashes when calling the `leaveChannel` method to leave a channel.

## v3.0.4

v3.0.4 was released on November 25, 2020.

#### New feature

v3.0.4 adds `Chunk_Time_Span` in `cfgFilePath`  to set time interval between two successive recorded files in individual recording mode of a live interactive streaming channel.

#### Issues fixed

- When a host repeatedly joins and leaves a channel, the physical memory consumption of the recording server increased significantly.
- Calling `OnActiveSpeaker` cannot get the corresponding callback.
- Calling `OnAudioVolumeIndication` cannot get the corresponding callback.
- Calling the Java API `setUserBackground` caused the recording service to crash.
- Failure to merge videos shorter than 0.02 s by using the transcoding script after the recording finishes.
- In composite recording mode, failure to output stereo audio by setting `audioProfile` as `2`.

## v3.0.3

v3.0.3 was released on September 17, 2020.

#### New feature

**Repair of recording files after crashes**

Before v3.0.3, the MP4 files generated after a recording might not be playable due to recording crashes. To solve this issue, as of v3.0.3, the Agora Recording SDK provides the following solutions:

- The SDK generates video files in TS format during the recording. When the recording ends, the SDK automatically converts the TS files to MP4 format. Even if occasional crashes occur during the recording, the MP4 files can still be played.
- The SDK adds the `crash_restore.sh` script. If the recording service quits abnormally after multiple crashes, you can run the script to convert the TS files to MP4 files and repair the incomplete `uid_UID_timestamp.txt` files.

## v3.0.2

v3.0.2 was released on July 15, 2020.

#### Issues fixed

- Timestamps occasionally overflow in `uid_UID_timestamp.txt`.
- Characters are garbled and contents lost when a line of text becomes too long in a log file.
- MP4 files generated from a composite recording session cannot be played via Windows Media Player.

## v3.0.1

v3.0.1 was released on March 16, 2020.

#### Issue fixed

Recorded files from an individual recording session have an incorrect timestamp in their names.

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 was released on February 20, 2020.

#### New features

**1. Watermarks**

Supports adding image watermarks, text watermarks, or a timestamp watermark in composite recording mode.

You can either configure watermark settings in the `setVideoMixingLayout` method, or add, update, and remove watermark settings with the `updateWatermarkConfigs` method. See [Watermark](../develop/watermark) for details.

**2. Selective recording**

Supports recording the audio or video of specified users.

To enable selective recording when calling `joinChannel`:

1. Set `autoSubscribe` as false in `RecordingConfig`.
2. Set the `subscribeVideoUids` or `subscribeAudioUids` parameter in `RecordingConfig `to specify the users to record. 

Afterwards, you can call `updateSuscribeVideoUids` or `updateSuscribeAudioUids` methods to update the list of uids to record.

**3. Last frame**

Retains the last video frame from when the user leaves the channel in composite recording mode.

You can set the `keepLastFrame` parameter when calling the `setVideoMixingLayout` method to enable this feature.

**4. Cloud proxy**

Supports the cloud proxy service. See [Use Cloud Proxy](../develop/cloud-proxy) for details.

**5. New callbacks**

#### Improvement

- As of v3.0.0, you can disable the keyframe request by setting the `enableIntraRequest` parameter in RecordingConfig. After this setting:
  - All senders in the channel send the keyframe at an interval of 2 seconds. 
  - You can play the video file recorded in individual recording mode from a specified position without the need to transcode.
- As of v3.0.0, setting the recording file path in the custom configuration file is no longer mandatory. If you have specified a custom configuration file by setting `cfgFilePath`, you do not have to set `Recording_Dir` in the configuration file.

#### Issues fixed

- In composite recording mode, the layout of the recorded video occasionally has an extra user region.
- The playback speed of the recorded video is occasionally too fast.
- The recording service creates too many Syslogs.
- Setting the `alpha` parameter in the method call of `setVideoMixingLayout` causes the recording service to crash.
- The recording service cannot record the specified uids if you set the server to record audio only, or to record video only.
- The information reported by the `onRemoteAudioStreamStateChanged` and `onRemoteVideoStreamStateChanged` callbacks is inaccurate under poor network conditions.
- The recorded audio is occasionally extended.
- A black frame appears at the beginning of a video in composite recording mode.

## v2.3.4
<Admonition type="info">As of December 8, 2021, Agora begins implementing the retirement process for the On-Premise Recording SDK earlier than v3.0.0. See [Service Sunset Plans for On-Premise Recording](/on-premise-recording/reference/sunset).</Admonition>

v2.3.4 was released on August 5, 2019.

#### Improvements

- The following private Java API methods are now public:
  - The `setUserBackground` method which sets the background image of a specified user. When the user is online but does not send any video stream, the background image is displayed.
  - The `setLogLevel` method which sets the logging level. The SDK generates logs in the selected level and in the levels preceding the selected level.
- Improves the robustness of Java API methods.
- Enhances the SDK's ability to collect the information of abnormal crashes.

#### Issues fixed

- File splitting in composite recording mode caused by switching channel profiles.
- Failure to only record audio in composite recording mode in the Live Broadcast profile.
- Libyuv crashes.
- Crashes when calling the `leaveChannel` method to leave a channel.

## v2.3.3

v2.3.3 was released on April 1, 2019. 

**New features**

#### 1. Supports monitoring the network connection status

v2.3.3 adds the following callbacks to inform the app of the connection status between the recording SDK and Agora's edge server:

- `onConnectionLost`: Informs that the SDK loses connection to the server.
- `onConnectionInterrupted`: Informs that the connection between the SDK and the server is interrupted.

#### 2. Informs the app of receiving the first frame 

v2.3.3 adds the following callbacks to inform the app of receiving the first remote audio or video frame:

- `onFirstRemoteAudioFrame`: Informs that the first remote audio frame is received.
- `onFirstRemoteVideoDecoded`: Informs that the first remote video frame is decoded. 

#### 3. Supports monitoring status changes of the receiving stream 

v2.3.3 adds the `onReceivingStreamStatusChanged` callback to get status changes of the receiving audio or video stream.

#### 4. Supports the volume indication

v2.3.3 adds the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to get the list of users who are speaking and their volumes. 

**Issues fixed**

- Fails to run the transcoding script when the recording SDK exits the channel and then enters the channel again in manual mode.
- Occasional crashes when using invalid parameters in the `mixedVideoAudio` method.
- Freezes in HD video recordings.
- Setting the recording video frame rate does not take effect.
- Occasional crashes when compiling the recording Java sample code in Manual Mode.
- Fails to run the transcoding command `-f . -m 3`.


## v2.3.0

v2.3.0 was released on January 14, 2019. 

> The calculation of the usage of the On-Premise Recording SDK v2.3.0 or later is separated from that of the Agora Voice Call/Interactive Audio Streaming SDK and the Agora Video Call/Interactive Video Streaming SDK. Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) for details.

**New features**

#### 1. Supports Stereo Audio in Composite Recording Mode

v2.3.0 supports high audio quality (a sample rate of 48 kHz, stereo, and a bitrate of up to 192 Kbps) in Composite Recording Mode.

> Stereo is not applicable to raw data. 

`audio profile` can be set as `0` or `1`:

- Individual recording (file mode):
  - By default or set `audio profile=0`: A sample rate of 48 kHz, the same number of audio channels as the original audio, and an adaptive bitrate.
- Individual recording (raw data):
  - The sample rate is fixed at 48 kHz and the number of audio channels is the same as the original audio:
    - PCM: The bitrate may change.
    - AAC: The bitrate is the same as in the file mode.
- Composite recording (file mode): 
  - `audio profile=0`: A sample rate of 48 kHz, mono, and a bitrate of 48 Kbps
  - `audio profile=1`: A sample rate of 48 kHz, mono, and a bitrate of 128 Kbps
  - `audio profile=2`: A sample rate of 48 kHz, stereo, and a bitrate of 192 Kbps
- Composite recording (raw data): 
  - A fixed sample rate of 48 kHz and mono.

#### 2. Supports Web Video Players 

Video files transcoded in real time or transcoded by the transcoding script can be played by web browsers on Android, iOS/macOS, and Windows. The following is a list of compatible web browsers on each platform.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th>Chrome </th>
    <th>Safari</th>
  </tr>

    <td>Safari 11+</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows</td>
    <td>Chrome 49+</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### 3. Supports Custom Background Images in Composite Recording Mode 

v2.3.0 adds the function for users to add a background image while recording audio in Composite Recording Mode. A custom image is used for any user who does not have video while recording video in Composite Recording Mode.

> This function is not applicable to raw data and screenshots.

#### 4. Adds Two Pre-defined Layout Templates to the Sample Code

v2.3.0 provides two pre-defined layout templates for composite recording to make the On-Premise Recording SDK sample code easier to use.

##### Best Fit (bestFit)

v2.3.0 adds <code>bestFit</code> as the default layout supporting up to 17 video streams.

This layout automatically scales according to the number of video streams. The number of columns and rows varies depending on the number of video streams. For example:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1542680053900)

##### Vertical Presentation（verticalPresentation）

v2.3.0 adds the function to display a specified user's video in a large window on the left of the screen, while displaying the other users' videos in small windows arranged vertically on the right. At most, two columns with eight video windows in each column are supported. 

For example:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1542680070362)

#### 5. Screenshots in Composite Recording Mode

v2.3.0 adds the function to capture the screen of every user while recording video in Composite Recording Mode. Recording and screen capturing use the same video stream.

#### 6. Speaker Detection

v2.3.0 adds the `onActiveSpeaker` callback to return the UID of the active speaker in the channel.

This function is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `audioIndicationInterval` parameter in `RecordingConfig`. The On-Premise Recording SDK returns the `onActiveSpeaker` callback at set intervals.

**Improvements**

- Improves audio and video synchronization in Individual Recording Mode.
- Supports automatic rotation of recorded video streams that are not transcoded in real time in Individual Recording Mode.
- Changed the idle behavior in Manual Mode:
  - For versions earlier than v2.3.0 in Manual Mode, the idle mechanism takes effect immediately after joining a channel, which might cause the recording SDK to exit the channel.
  - For v2.3.0 or later, the idle mechanism does not take effect until the `startService` method is called.
- Optimizes the log levels and split some logs in INFO into NOTICE, WARN, and ERROR.
- Optimizes the naming of the recording directory to ensure the uniqueness of each folder.
