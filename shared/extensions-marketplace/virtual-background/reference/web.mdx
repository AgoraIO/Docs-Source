- For a working example, check out the [Virtual Background web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/virtualBackground/index.html) and the associated [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web/tree/main/Demo/virtualBackground).

### Considerations

- This extension works best when there is only one user in the video captured by the camera.
- The browser support for the virtual background extension is as follows:
   - To get a better virtual background experience, Agora recommends using this feature on the latest version of Desktop Chrome.
   - Agora does not recommend enabling the virtual background feature on Firefox and Safari browsers. Backgrounding the web app on Firefox may cause the video to freeze, while the performance on Safari could be poor due to the browser's own performance issues.
   - Agora does not recommend enabling the virtual background feature on mobile browsers.
- The virtual background feature has high performance requirements. Make sure your computer meets the following requirements:
   - CPU: Intel Core i5 4 cores or higher
   - 8G RAM or more
   - 64-bit operating system
- If multiple extensions are enabled concurrently and other programs are occupying high system resources at the same time, your app may experience audio and video freezes.
- When using this extension, Agora recommends selecting `Performance` mode or `Balanced` mode for your laptops. The computing requirements for this extension may not be met if the laptop is in a battery-saving mode.
- This extension supports using a video as a dynamic virtual background since v1.0.0-beta-3. Videos must be in a format supported by `<video>` HTML elements. Agora also recommends meeting the following requirements:
   - The video adopts a resolution close to that of a portrait. Agora recommends not using a video with too high a bit rate.
   - Video content is suitable for looping to achieve a more natural dynamic virtual background effect.
   - Properly reduce the video frame rate, such as 15 fps or below. Video above 30 fps is not recommended by Agora.

### API reference

#### IVirtualBackgroundExtension

##### createProcessor

```typescript
createProcessor(): IVirtualBackgroundProcessor;
```

Creates a `VirtualBackgroundProcessor` object.

#### IVirtualBackgroundProcessor

##### init

```typescript
init(wasmDir: string): Promise<void>;
```

Initializes the extension.

Parameters:

- `wasmDir`: The URL where the virtual background WASM module is located (without the `WASM` filename). Starting from v1.2.0, this parameter is optional.

If the initialization of the extension fails due to the failure to access the Wasm file, this method throws an exception. Agora recommends that you disable the virtual background feature catching the exception.

If the Wasm file is deployed on third-party services such as CDN and OSS across domains, you need to enable cross-domain access. For example, when deploying Nginx servers across domains, to enable cross-domain access, add the following configurations:

```
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' "$http_origin";
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' "true";
```

<a name="setoptions"></a>

##### setOptions

```typescript
setOptions(options: VirtualBackgroundEffectOptions): void;
```

Chooses the virtual background type, and sets parameters.

Parameters:

- `options`: The virtual background options. See [VirtualBackgroundEffectOptions](#virtualbackgroundeffectoptions).

##### enable

```typescript
enable(): void | Promise<void>;
```

Enables the virtual background feature.

If you do not call `setOptions` before calling this method, the default behavior of the SDK is to blur users' actual background with the blurring degree set as 1.

##### disable

```typescript
disable(): void | Promise<void>;
```

Disables the virtual background feature.

#### release

```typescript
release(): Promise<void>;
```

Releases all resources used by the extension, including created web workers .

If `IVirtualBackgroundProcessor` is repeatedly created without releasing the resources occupied by the extension, it may cause memory exhaustion.

##### onoverload

```typescript
onoverload?: () => void;
```

When the system performance cannot meet the processing requirements, the SDK triggers `onoverload`.

Agora recommends calling `disable` in this event to disable virtual background and adding a UI prompt.

### Type definition

<a name="virtualbackgroundeffectoptions"></a>

##### VirtualBackgroundEffectOptions

Virtual background types and settings. Used in the [setOptions](#setoptions) method.

```typescript
export type VirtualBackgroundEffectOptions = {
  type: string,
  color?: string;
  source?: HTMLImageElement;
  blurDegree?: Number;
};
```

Properties:

- `type`: String. Choose the virtual background type:
   - `"color"`: Sets a solid color as the background.
   - `"img"`: Sets an image as the background.
   - `"blur"`: Blurs the user's original background.
   - `"video"`: Sets a video as the dynamic background.
   - `"none"`: Removes the background, that is, creates the effect of a portrait cutout.

- `color`: String. When you set `type` as `"color"`, set this parameter to specify the color. The value must be a valid CSS color such as `"white"`, `"#00ff00"`, or ` "RGB(255, 0, 0)"`.

- `source`: The HTMLImageElement object. When you set `type` as `"img"`, you can set a custom background image through this parameter.

<Admonition type="info" info="notice">
- If the error "texture bound to texture unit 2 is not renderable. It might be non-power-of-2 or have incompatible texture filtering (maybe)?" occurs, check whether the product of the picture's width and height is a multiple of 2.
- Due to the restriction of browsers' security policy, if your background image resources are deployed across domains, you need to enable your servers' cross-domain permission and set the `crossOrigin` property of the `HTMLImageElement` object as `anonymous`.
- Since it takes time to load the image in the `HTMLImageElement` object, Agora recommends calling `setOptions` in the `onload` callback of the `HTMLImageElement` object, otherwise, the background momentarily turns black.
</Admonition>

- `blurDegree`: Number. When you set `type` as `"blur"`, set this parameter to choose the blurring degree:
   - `1`: Low
   - `2`: Medium
   - `3`: High

- `fit`: String. Set this parameter to choose how the virtual background is filled:
   - `"contain"`: Fill in proportion to ensure that the background can be displayed completely, and fill the insufficient part with black.
   - `"cover"`: Fill in proportion and ensure that the background can fill the area, and the excess part will be cropped.
   - `"fill"`: Stretch to fill the area.
