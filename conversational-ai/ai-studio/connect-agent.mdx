  Integrate your deployed agent into applications using APIs and webhooks.

After deploying your agent, you can integrate it into your applications using the Conversational AI Engine API. This enables you to trigger agent calls programmatically and receive real-time notifications about call events.

## Prerequisites

- A deployed agent
- Agora [Customer ID and Customer secret](/conversational-ai/rest-api/restful-authentication#generate-customer-id-and-customer-secret): Used for HTTP authentication when calling the RESTful APIs.
- For webhooks: A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint to receive event notifications

## Agent identifiers

Each deployed agent has two identifiers:

- **Agent Pipeline ID**: This unique identifier connects your agent to any integration or deployment. Use this ID to reference your agent in API calls. 
- **Agent ID**: Internal identifier used for dashboard management and reference within <Vpd k="STUDIO" />.

You can find this information in the **Connect Agent** panel. To access the panel:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Agents** in the sidebar.
1. From the list of agents, select the desired agent and click **Connect Agent**.

## Trigger agent calls

Use the Conversational AI Engine REST API to start agent calls from your backend service or application. The following example shows how to call the REST API to place a call using your deployed agent:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agora.io/v1/agents/<your_pipeline_id>/call \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "variables": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe"
  }
}'
```

Replace the following values in the example:

- `YOUR_API_KEY`: Your Agora API key. See [RESTful authentication](/conversational-ai/rest-api/restful-authentication)
- `<your_pipeline_id>`: Your Agent Pipeline ID
- `+1234567890`: The phone number to call in E.164 format
- `variables`: A set of key-value pairs for the variables used in the **System Message** and **Greeting Message** of your LLM configuration.

## Get notified of agent events

You can specify a Webhook URL to receive real-time notifications about call events. To set the webhook URL:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Agents** in the sidebar.
1. From the list of agents, select the desired agent and click **Connect Agent**.
1. Switch to the **API** tab and select **Webhook URL**
1. Enter your webhook URL and click **Save**

Your webhook endpoint receives POST requests when call events occur. The following example shows the payload you receive when a call is completed:

```json
{
  "event": "call.completed",
  "pipeline_id": "999df999a47d4b7d94ab5fb1ebe1d4b0",
  "call_id": "call_abc123",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "duration": 145,
  "transcript": "Hello, how can I help you today? ...",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
