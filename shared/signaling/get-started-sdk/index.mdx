## Project setup

To create a <Vpd  k="SDK" /> development environment:

<Setup />

## Implement <Vg k="MESS" />

Best practice is to separate the <Vg k="MESS" /> workflows from your UI implementation. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> sample
project implements the <Vg k="MESS" />  business logic in the `SignalingManager` object. This class encapsulates the
`signalingEngine`, an instance of the`AgoraRTM`, and core functionality such as logging in To <Vg k="MESS"
/>, sending a message, listening for messages from other users and logging out.

The following code examples show how to implement these steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<Implement />


## Test this <Vg k="MESS" /> implementation

This section explains how to run the sample project and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
