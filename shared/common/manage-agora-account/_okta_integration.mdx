### Okta Integration

If you are using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as the identity provider for your app, you can configure Agora Console so that your team members can log into Agora using their Okta accounts.

#### Prerequisites

- An Okta developer account with admin privileges
- An Agora account with the **Admin** role assigned
- A Premium or Enterprise Agora Support package

#### Configuration steps

1. Apply for Okta integration in Agora Console.

   Log in to your Agora account. On the [SSO Management](https://console.agora.io/settings/m_sso) page, click **Apply** next to Okta integration.

   Once you apply, a request is sent to Agora to enable integration for you.

   When your application is processed by Agora, **SAML Configuration** on the same page is automatically enabled and a set of **SSO URL** and **Audience URI** is generated.

1. Configure SAML settings in Agora Console

   In the **SAML Configuration** section on the [SSO Management](https://console.agora.io/settings/m_sso) page in Agora Console, enter the following information from Okta Console:

      - **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL**
      - **Identity Provider Issuer**
      - **X.509 Certificate**, including the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE lines`.

   Click **Save**.

1. Manage access

   You can manage access for your team members manually using SAML, which is enabled when you apply for Okta
   integration in Agora Console, or automatically, if you additionally enable SCIM. Manual management means that adding, managing, and removing a team member's access must be done in both, Okta and Agora Console. Automatic management means that SCIM automatically adds, manages, and removes members' access to Agora Console when you make changes in Okta.

   **Note**: Once enabled, SAML is applicable for both, existing and newly created Agora accounts for team members. For new accounts, however, log in as the admin in Agora Console and create an account *before* it is configured in Okta. SCIM is applicable only for new accounts.

   - Manual management with SAML

     1. In Agora Console, add team members and choose their roles. For details, see [Manage Members and Roles](#manage-members-and-roles).
     1. In Okta Console, go to **Directory** > **People**. Ensure that the email address of each team member is the same as that in Agora Console.
     1. Go to **Applications** > **Applications** > **Agora integration**.
     1. On the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** and select **Assign to People**.
     1. Enter the team members that need to sign in to Agora Console and click **Assign** for each. Click **Done**.

   - Automated management with SCIM

     1. In Agora Console, enable **SCIM API Basic Auth** on the **SSO Management** page. A set of username and password is generated,
        along with the SCIM connector base URL.

        ![scim-enabled](/images/common/scim-enabled.png)
     1. In Okta Console, select the **General** tab under **Agora integration** and click **Edit**.
     1. In the **Provisioning** section, select **SCIM** and click **Save**.

        - Under **Supported provisioning actions**, tick all the checkboxes.
        - In **Authentication Mode**, select **Basic Auth**.

After enabling and configuring Okta integration, you can choose to enable the Big Bang feature. In this case, login
to Agora Console with email and password is no longer available and your team members can log in only through Okta. To
enable this feature, contact [Agora support](mailto:support@agora.io).
