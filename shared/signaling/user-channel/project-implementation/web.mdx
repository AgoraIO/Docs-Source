To send message to a user channel, call the `publish` method with the `channelType` parameter set to `USER` and the `channelName` parameter set to the target user's `userId`. This method enables you to send a message to one user at a time. To send messages to multiple users, call this method for each user. While <Vg k="SIG" /> does not limit the number of users you can send messages to or receive messages from, it does [limit](../reference/limitations#message-channel) the frequency at which you can send messages to users.

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

- String message

    ```js
    const payload = "Hello Agora!";
    const channelName = "Tony";
    const options = {
        customType: "PlainTxt",
        channelType: "USER",
    };
    try {
        const result = await rtm.publish(channelName, payload, options);
    } catch (status) {
        const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
        console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode: ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`);
    }
    ```

- Binary message

    ```js
    const message = "Hello Agora!";
    const payload = new TextEncoder().encode(message);
    const channelName = "Tony";
    const options = { customType:"ByteArray", channelType: "USER" }
    try {
        const result = await rtm.publish(channelName, payload, options);
    } catch (status) {
        const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
        console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode: ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`);
    }
    ```
