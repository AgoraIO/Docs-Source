The Agora Notification Callback Service (NCS) server sends the message notification callbacks of Broadcast Streaming as HTTPS POST requests to your server. The data format is JSON, the character encoding is UTF-8, and the signature algorithm is HMAC/SHA1 or HMAC/SHA256.

## Request header

The `header` of the message notification callbacks contains the following fields:

| Field name | Value |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json;charset=utf-8` |
| `Agora-Signature` | The signature value is generated by using the **secret** and the HMAC/SHA1 algorithm.  You need to use the **secret** and HMAC/SHA1 algorithm to verify this signature value. For more details, see [Signature Verification](signature-verification). |
| `Agora-Signature-V2` | The signature value is generated by using the **secret** and the HMAC/SHA256 algorithm.  You need to use the **secret** and the HMAC/SHA256 algorithm to verify this signature value. For more details, see [Signature Verification](signature-verification). |

## Request body

The request body of the message notification callbacks contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noticeId` | String | The notification ID, identifying the notification for each event sent from the Agora server. |
| `productId` | Integer | The service ID. A value of 7 indicates the Broadcast Streaming service. |
| `eventType` | Integer | The event type of the notification. For more details, see the [Event Types of Broadcast Streaming](#event-type). |
| `notifyMs` | Integer | The Unix timestamp (ms) of the event notification that the Agora NCS server sends to your server. This value is updated when **Retry** is notified. |
| `payload` | JSON Object | The content of the event notification. The `payload` varies with the `eventType`. For more details, see the [Event Types of Broadcast Streaming](#event-type). |

An example of the request body of message notification callbacks:
