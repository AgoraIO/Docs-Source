To meet the needs of video content supervision, Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to take screenshots of the video stream in a channel and then upload these images to third-party cloud storage.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, web, windows">

This page shows you how to enable screenshot uploads on your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and handle screenshot upload callbacks.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
Local screenshot upload is a paid service. For billing details, refer to [Pricing](../overview/pricing).
</Admonition>

## Understand the tech

When you enable screenshot upload, you set the interval between screenshots. After each interval, <Vg k="VSDK" /> takes a screenshot of the video stream sent by local users, and uploads the image to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uploads each screenshot to your third-party cloud storage and sends a callback notification to your server in the form of an `HTTPS` request.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> local screenshot upload feature, take the following steps:

1. **Activate local screenshot upload service**

   Log in to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io), select the project for which you want to activate the local screenshot upload service, and then click **Configure**. Scroll down to the features section to find **Video Screenshot Upload** and click **Config**.

      ![Enable screenshot upload](/images/video-sdk/enable-screen-shoot-upload.png)

2. **Configure third-party cloud storage**

    In the **Video Screenshot Upload Configuration**, update the screenshot upload settings:

    ![Screenshot upload config](/images/video-sdk/screenshot-upload-configuration.png)

    Fill in the following information:

    - **Screenshot Callback Address**: The server address to receive callback notifications of local screenshot upload results.
    - **Storage**: Third-party cloud storage provider. Select AWS.
   
        <Admonition type="info" title="Information">
        Currently, the Agora local screenshot upload service supports Amazon S3 as the third-party cloud storage provider. If you want to use other provider, [contact](mailto:support@agora.io) technical support.
        </Admonition>

    - **Region**: The data center region setting for third-party cloud storage. See [AWS Official   Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) for details.
    - **Access Key**: String type, the access key of the third-party cloud storage. Best practice is to provide a write-only access key.
    - **Secret Key**: String type, the secret key of the third-party cloud storage.
    - **Bucket Name**: String type, the bucket name of the third-party cloud storage. The bucket name must comply with the naming rules of the corresponding third-party cloud storage service.
    - **Endpoint**: Specify the access domain (Endpoint) of the bucket. See [AWS Official Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) for details.
    - **Filename Prefix**: (Optional) JSON Array, an array composed of multiple strings, indicating the storage location of screenshots in the third-party cloud storage. For example, if `fileNamePrefix` = `["directory1","directory2"]`, the prefix `directory1/directory2/` will be added to the screenshot filename, that is, `directory1/directory2/xxx.jpg`. The prefix length, including slashes, must not exceed 128 characters. The string should not contain symbols such as slashes, underscores, parentheses, and so on. The supported character set is as follows:

        - 26 lowercase English letters a-z
        - 26 uppercase English letters A-Z
        - 10 digits 0-9

    - Endpoint: `s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn`
    - Filename Prefix: `test`
    </details>

3. **Integrate SDK**

   Integrate the <Vpd k="SDK" /> (including the local screenshot upload dynamic library) into your project, join a channel, and publish a video stream. See [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) for details.

## Implement local screenshot upload

You enable screenshot upload in your <Vpd k="NAME" /> client and handle the notification callback from Agora on your callback server.

### Enable screenshot upload

Call the `enableContentInspect` method to enable the local screenshot upload feature. After successfully enabling the feature, the SDK will capture screenshots at the specified frequency and upload them to the Agora cloud server. To implement this logic, refer to the following code:

<ProjectImplement/>

###  HTTP notification callback

After a screenshot is successfully uploaded to the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, Agora sends a message notification callback to your application server in the form of an `HTTPS` `POST` request. The data format is `JSON`, and the character encoding is `UTF-8`.

Upon receiving the message notification, your application server must respond with status code `200`. The expected response body format is `JSON`. In any of the following cases, the notification is considered to have failed:

* No response is received from your server within 5 seconds after sending the message notification.
* The `HTTP` status code of the response is not `200`, or the response body format is not `JSON`.

The Agora service immediately retries after the first notification failure, and sends the message three times in total.

#### Request header

#### Request body

The request body is a JSON Object, containing the following fields:

| Field            | Type        | Description                                                 |

| `checksum`      | String      | MD5 value calculated from the parameters `callbackAddr`, `code`, `object`, and `requestId`. Used to verify whether this callback notification comes from the local screenshot upload service. |
| `object`        | String      | Name of the screenshot file. The naming convention for this file is: `<OSS prefix>/<year month day>/<sid>_<cname>__uid_s_<uid>__uid_e_<type>_utc.jpg`. The meanings of the fields in the filename are as follows: <ul><li>`<sid>`: Screenshot ID, a unique identifier for a screenshot.</li><li>`<cname>`: Channel name to which the user being screenshotted belongs.</li><li>`<uid>`: The user ID set when joining the channel.</li><li>`<type>`: File type, supports only `video`.</li><li>`<utc>`: Unix timestamp of this screenshot. UTC time, consists of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. For example, if `utc` is equal to `20190611073246073`, it represents the start time of this slice file as UTC June 11, 2019, 7:32:46.073 AM.</li></ul> |

#### Response

After receiving the message notification, your application server is expected to respond. The response package format is JSON. In any of the following cases, the Agora service considers the notification as failed:

- After sending a message notification, no response is received from your server within 5 seconds.
- The HTTP status code of the response is not `200`, or the response body format is not JSON.

The Agora service immediately retries and sends the message notification again after the first notification fails. It attempts to notify you three times in total.
