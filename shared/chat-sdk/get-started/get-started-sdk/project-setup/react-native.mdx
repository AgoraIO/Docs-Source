Follow these steps to create a React Native project and add Agora Chat into your app.

1. Make sure you have set up the development environment based on your operating system and target platform.
2. In your terminal, run the following command to create a React Native project:

   ```sh
   npx react-native init token_login_demo
   cd token_login_demo
   yarn
   ```

   A successful execution of this command generates a project named `token_login_demo` in the directory where you run the command.

3. Run the following command to import the Chat SDK using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add agora-react-native-chat
   ```

4. If your target platform is iOS, run the following command to execute the tools:

   ```sh
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```
