Agora provides a <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service (<Vg k="NCS"/>) that sends notifications about <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="NAME"/> events. You can set up an HTTP/HTTPS server to receive such notifications. When an event occurs, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service notifies the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service, and then the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service notifies your server of the event through an HTTP/HTTPS request.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Best Practice">
Agora does not recommended that core applications rely heavily on <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/>. If your application currently depends heavily on NCS, contact support@agora.io to enable the redundant message notification function. This feature doubles the number of received notifications, thereby reducing the probability of message loss. However, after enabling this function, you must check the message SID to manage duplicate messages. Please note that message notifications still cannot guarantee a 100% arrival rate.

## Callback information

After you enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/>, when a specified event occurs, the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> server sends an HTTP/HTTPS request as a callback. The request body provides the main information of the callback in a JSON object. The JSON object contains different fields for different events.

- The following [Payload fields](#payload-fields) are common for all <Vpd k="NAME"/> events.
- The values of `eventType`, `serviceType`, and `details` depend on the event. For details, see `EventType`.

### Payload fields

The `payload` JSON object, which is the main body of a notification, includes the following fields in each type of event notification:

- `cname`: String. The name of the channel to be transcribed.
- `subBotUid`: String. The UID of the bot subscribing to the audio.
- `pubBotUid`: String. The UID of the bot publishing the text to the channel.
- `taskId`: String. The ID of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> task.
- `sequence`: Number. The serial number of the notification, starting from `0`. You can use this parameter to identify notifications that are random, lost, or re-sent.
- `serviceScene`: String, the current service scene.
    - `1`: <Vpd k="NAME"/> service.
- `sendts`: Number. The time (UTC) when the event happens. Unix timestamp in ms.
- `serviceType`: Number. The type of Agora service.
    - `0`: The Real-Time STT service.
    - `1`: The STT module.
    - `2`: The uploader module.
- `details`: JSON. The details of the callback events provided in the tables below. The <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service may add new fields in the future. To ensure backward compatibility, the service will not change the data format of the existing fields.

## Callback events

|eventType | serviceType | Event description |
|---|---|---|
| `4` | `0` (<Vpd k="NAME"/> service) | The M3U8 playlist file is generated for `.vtt` files. |
| `30` | `2` (uploader module) | The upload service starts. |
| `31` | `2` (uploader module) | All the `.vtt` files are uploaded to the specified third-party cloud storage. |
| `32` | `2` (uploader module) | All the `.vtt` files are uploaded, but at least one file is uploaded to Agora Cloud Backup. |
| `33` | `2` (uploader module) | The progress of uploading the `.vtt` files to the cloud storage. |

### What are the differences between the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service and the `query` method?

You can monitor the status of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service either through the `query` method or by the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service, to take action when required. Both options have pros and cons.

#### The `query` method

You can periodically call the `query` method to monitor the status of <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

- Pros: Reliable, as the status is queried proactively.
- Cons:
    - Provides limited status information.
    - Requires an active query. You cannot query too often because of the Queries Per Second (QPS) limit, and thus it is not as real-time as the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service.

If the status reliability of <Vpd k="NAME"/> is a high priority, Agora strongly recommends using the `query` method.

#### <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service

You can use the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service as a complementary option to monitor the service status. You need to configure an HTTP/HTTPS server to receive event notifications.

- Pros: Real-time
- Cons:
    - The server passively receives messages, and the messages may get lost.
    - The confirmation message of the message delivery may get lost, causing the message to be re-sent. In such a case, you need to deduplicate the notifications.
- The messages may not arrive in the correct order.
