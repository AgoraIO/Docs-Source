- Peak PCU: $30 per 1000 PCU
- Messages: $3 per 1 Million
- Storage: $15 per 1 GB-hour



### Costing examples

#### Example 1 - Pro package
Suppose your number of peak concurrent users is less than 2500, monthly message volume is less than 150M, and storage use is less than 10GB (average GB-hours), the monthly billing will be $399.

Additional Usage (Overage Charges):

Usage above the fixed plans will be charged at the same rates as before:

- Peak PCU: $30 per 1000 PCU
- Messages: $3 per 1 Million
- Storage: $15 per 1 GB-hour.

**For details on the storage calculation please refer to the storage calculation method below**

#### Example 2 - Pay-as-you-go (Enterprise Package)
Suppose your number of peak concurrent users is 20K, monthly message volume is 800M, and storage is 3.8 GB (average GB-hours). The monthly billing is calculated as follows:

- **Peak Concurrent Users (PCU) Cost**

    PCU: 20,000 (Recorded as highest PCU in the month. The highest PCU is considered as average for billing)
    PCU Cost = 20000/1000 x $30 = $600 ($30 for every thousand peak concurrent users).

- **Message volume cost**

    Message count: 800M (Monthly Volume)
    Message cost = 800 x $3 = $2400 ($3 for every million messages).

- **Storage cost**

    How Storage is measured and billed:

    Suppose the storage usage throughout March (a 31-day month) is as follows:

    - Week 1: They host small events, averaging 2 GB of storage
    - Week 2-3: Their major annual conference increases usage to 6 GB
    - Week 4+: Usage returns to normal at 2 GB

    How Agora Calculates the Bill

    - Hourly Snapshots: Agora takes a "storage snapshot" every hour (24 times daily)
    - Monthly Average: All hourly readings are added up, then divided by total hours in March (31 days × 24 hours = 744 hours)

    Simplified March storage bill calculation:

    - Storage Rate: $15.00 per GB per month
    - Week 1 (7 days): 2 GB × (7 days × 24 hours) = 336 GB-hours
    - Weeks 2-3 (14 days): 6 GB × (14 days × 24 hours) = 2,016 GB-hours
    - Week 4+ (10 days): 2 GB × (10 days × 24 hours) = 480 GB-hours

    Total storage use: 336 + 2,016 + 480 = 2,832 GB-hours

    Average Storage: 2,832 GB-hours ÷ 744 hours = 3.8 GB average

    Total cost for Storage: 3.8 GB × $15.00 = $57.00

- **Total cost** 

    PCU + Messages + Storage: $600 + $2,400 + $57 = $3,057
