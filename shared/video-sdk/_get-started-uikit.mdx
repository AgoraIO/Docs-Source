The fastest and easiest way to get started with <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/> is to use the <Vg k="vUIK" />. It implements commonly-used features and flows to get you up and running in minutes. This open source project includes best practices for business logic, as well as a pre-built UI that is highly customizable.

This page outlines the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="NAME"/> functionality into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using the <Vg k="vUIK" />.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="vUIK" /> simplifies the implementation of <Vpd k="NAME"/> by handling common calling logic such as remote user status, and displaying it in a pre-built customizable UI. <Vg k="vUIK" /> contains the following components:

To use the <Vg k="UIK" />, implement the following steps in your app:

1.  **Create an instance of the viewer**

    Declare and initialize an instance of the <Vg k="UIK" /> viewer.

2.  **Join a channel**

    When you execute the `join` command, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to [<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />](../overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn), and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.

    Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

<PrerequisitesGetStarted />

## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="NAME"/> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="UIK" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="NAME"/>

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="NAME"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. <Link target="_blank" to = "../get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token">Generate a temporary token</Link> in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

1. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

- See the Open Source <Vg k="vUIK"/> projects on GitHub <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.UIKIT_GH_HUB}}">here</Link>.

- [Downloads](../reference/downloads) shows you how to install <Vpd k="SDK" /> manually.

- To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, use a token server to generate token is recommended to ensure communication security, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow).

Since <Vg k="vUIK" /> is a drop-in solution, it has customization limits that might not meet all your needs. If you want to change the UI or add more features, fork the open-source GitHub repository and build your own version. For substantially different scenarios and UI implementations, implement your own solution by following the [SDK Quickstart](./get-started/get-started-sdk) guide.
