## Create agent from pipeline

Once your pipeline is configured, saved, and tested, you can create agent instances:

1. In the pipeline editor, click **Create Agent**.
2. Enter a name for your agent.
3. Review the agent configuration inherited from the pipeline.
4. Click **Create**.

Your agent is now created and ready for deployment. You can create multiple agents from the same pipeline, each with the same configuration but deployed independently.

Deploy and Connect your agent + 6. Deploy agent
These seem overlapping - need clarification

Option A: Combine into one document

Deploy agent to production
Connect to downstream channels (telephony, web, mobile)

Option B: Separate documents

"Deploy and Connect" = connecting to channels/services
"Deploy agent" = production deployment process

Questions:

What's the distinction between these two topics?
What are the deployment targets (production environment, channels, integrations)?
Is deployment automatic when connecting to telephony, or separate steps?
