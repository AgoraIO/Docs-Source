5. **Initialization best practice**

      When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts, it does the following:

      - Displays the available audio devices.
      - Sets the audio profile.

6. **Test audio devices**:

      1. Select an audio device from the **Audio Devices** dropdown.
      1. Click **Start device test**.

            The audio from the selected audio recording device is played on the playback device.

      1. To stop the test, click **Stop Test**.

1. **Join a channel**

    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
    Select a user role using the radio buttons. To connect to a channel, click **Join**, then grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling, voice-calling">
    To connect to a channel, click **Join**, then grant microphone access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
    </ProductWrapper>

      You see the last-mile uplink and downlink network quality indicators updated periodically based on the result of the `network-quality` callback.

9. **Test In-call quality statistics**

      Click *Show Statistics*. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> prints the selected call-quality statistics in the debug console.
