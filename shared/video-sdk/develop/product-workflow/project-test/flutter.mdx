3. In `/lib/main.dart` and update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

4. Connect a test device to your development device.

5. In your IDE, click **Run app**. A moment later, you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run your app, grant camera and microphone permissions.

7. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your test device as you move the slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap the **Mute** `CheckBox` while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app. You notice that the remote audio is muted on your test device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `onVolumeChanged` replace the `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid:_remoteUid!, volume:volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `onMuteChecked` replace the `muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(uid: _remoteUid!, mute: _isMuted);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(_isMuted);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.

6. **Test Screen sharing**

    1. To build your app for the Windows platform, run `flutter build windows`. A `build\` directory is created in your project folder. 
    
    1. [Compile the project with Visual Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/windows/building#compiling-with-visual-studio) and run the app.
    
    1. Press **Start Screen Sharing**. You see your device screen shared in the web demo app and in the local video container.

    1. Press **Stop Screen Sharing**. Screen sharing is stopped and the camera stream is restored in the web demo app.
