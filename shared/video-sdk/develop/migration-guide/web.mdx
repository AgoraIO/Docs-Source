## Migration steps

This section takes building a video conferencing app as an example and introduces the differences between implementing the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> and the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" /> in detail.

### Join a channel

First, create a `Client` object and join a specified channel.

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />

    ```js
    const client = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "live", codec: "vp9" });
    client.init("APPID", () => {
      client.join("Token", "Channel", null, (uid) => {
        console.log("join success", uid);
      }, (e) => {
        console.log("join failed", e);
      });
    });
    ```

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />
    ```js
        const client = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "live", codec: "vp9" });

        try {
          const uid = await client.join("APPID", "Channel", "Token", uid);
          console.log("join success");
        } catch (e) {
          console.log("join failed", e);
        }
    ```
Here we assume that our code runs within in an `async` function and use `await` in the following code snippets.

Key points:

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, we use the `Promise` object together with `async/await` for the asynchronous operation `join`.

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes the `client.init` method and you pass `APPID` when calling `client.join`. If you want to join another channel that uses a different App ID, you do not need to create another client object.

### Create an audio track and a video track

Second, create an audio track object from the audio sampled by a microphone and create a local video track from the video captured by a camera. In the sample code, by default, we play the local video track and do not play the local audio track.

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />

    ```js
    const localStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({ audio: true, video: true });
    localStream.init(() => {
      console.log("init stream success");
      localStream.play("DOM_ELEMENT_ID", { muted: true });
    }, (e) => {
      console.log("init local stream failed", e);
    });
    ```

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />

    ```js
        const localAudio = await AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack();
        const localVideo = await AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack();
        console.log("create local audio/video track success");

        localVideo.play("DOM_ELEMENT_ID");
    ```
Key points:

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes the `Stream` object. Call `createMicrophoneAudioTrack` to create an audio track and call `createCameraVideoTrack` to create a video track.

-   The audio and video track objects in the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> do not provide the `init` method because the SDK initializes the microphone and camera when creating the tracks and notifies you of the result with promises.

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> can control the playback of local audio and video tracks separately and removes the `muted` parameter in the `play` method. If you do not want to play the local audio track, do not call `play` in the local audio track object.


### Publish the local audio and video tracks

After creating the local audio and video tracks, publish these tracks to the channel.

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />

    ```js
    client.publish(localStream, err => {
      console.log("publish failed", err);
    });
    client.on("stream-published",  () => {
      console.log("publish success");
    });
    ```

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />
    ```js
    try {
      // Remove this line if the channel profile is not live broadcast.
      await client.setClientRole("host");
      await client.publish([localAudio, localVideo]);
      console.log("publish success");
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("publish failed", e);
    }
    ```
Key points:

-   If your channel profile is <Vpl k="API-REF-WEB" />/interfaces/clientconfig.html#mode[live broadcast], the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" /> automatically sets the user role as `host` when publishing the stream. However, in the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, you need to call `setClientRole` to set the user role as `host`.

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, `publish` returns a `Promise` object representing the eventual completion or failure of the asynchronous operation.

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, when calling `publish`, you need to pass one or multiple `LocalTrack` objects instead of the `Stream` object. You can call `publish` repeatedly to publish multiple tracks and call `unpublish` repeatedly to unpublish multiple tracks.

### Subscribe to remote media tracks and play

When a remote user in the channel publishes media tracks, we need to automatically subscribe to these tracks and play. To do this, you need to listen for the `user-published` event and call `subscribe` when the SDK triggers this event.

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />

    ```js
    client.on("stream-added", e => {
      client.subscribe(e.stream, { audio: true, video: true }, err => {
        console.log("subscribe failed", err);
      });
    });

    client.on("stream-subscribed", e => {
      console.log("subscribe success");
      e.stream.play("DOM_ELEMENT_ID");
    });
    ```

- Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />
    ```js
    client.on("user-published", async (remoteUser, mediaType) => {
      await client.subscribe(remoteUser, mediaType);
      if (mediaType === "video" || mediaType === "all") {
        console.log("subscribe video success");
        remoteUser.videoTrack.play("DOM_ELEMENT_ID");
      }
      if (mediaType === "audio" || mediaType === "all") {
        console.log("subscribe audio success");
        remoteUser.audioTrack.play();
      }
    });
    ```
Key points:

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> replaces the `stream-added`, `stream-removed`, and `stream-updated` events with the `user-published` and `user-unpublished` events.

    Pay attention to the `mediaType` parameter of the `user-published` event, which marks the type of the current track the remote user publishes. It can be `"video"` or `"audio"`. If the remote user publishes an audio track and a video track at the same time, the SDK triggers two `user-published` events, in which `mediaType` is `"audio"` and `"video"` respectively.

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, `subscribe` returns a `Promise` object representing the eventual completion or failure of the asynchronous operation. When calling `subscribe`, pass a `remoteUser` object. For details, see <Link to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/iagorartcremoteuser.html">AgoraRTCRemoteUser</Link>.

-   When the subscription succeeds, the subscribed tracks are updated to `remoteUser` and you can go on to call `play`.

## What’s changed

This section lists the major changes to <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

### Use promises for asynchronous operations

For asynchronous methods such as joining and leaving a channel, publishing and subscribing, enumerating media input devices, and starting and stopping live transcoding, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> notifies users of the results of these asynchronous operations with callbacks or events, while the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> uses promises.

### Fine control over audio and video tracks

For the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, we replace the <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT_PREV_SDK}}/interfaces/agorartc.stream.html">Stream</Link> object with `Track` objects. You create, publish, or subscribe to one or multiple audio and video tracks. Tracks make up a stream. The advantage of dividing a stream up into tracks is that audio and video are controllable separately. And these new methods are easier to use than the `Stream.addTrack` and `Stream.removeTrack` methods in the <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

For now, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> allows publishing multiple audio tracks but only one video track. The SDK automatically mixes multiple audio tracks into one when publishing.

In addition to replacing the `Stream` object with `Track` objects, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> provides different interfaces for the local and remote tracks. Some methods and objects are only available locally, and some are only available remotely. This change affects multiple API methods, including creating objects, publishing, and subscribing to tracks. For details, see [Create an audio track and a video track](#create-an-audio-track-and-a-video-track) and [Publish the local audio and video tracks](#publish-the-local-audio-and-video-tracks).

### Improved channel events

The improved events are:

-   **Rename events**

    The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> ensures the consistency of all event names. For example, Agora renames `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` as `token-privilege-will-expire`. Agora also renames several events to ensure developers can better understand how they work. For example, Agora renames `peer-online` and `peer-offline` as `user-joined` and `user-left`, `stream-added` and `stream-removed` as `user-published` and `user-unpublished`.

-   **Change the format of parameters in events**

    In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />, the parameters of events must be wrapped in an object, while in the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, you can directly pass multiple parameters in events.

    Take the `"connection-state-change"` event as an example:

    - Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />

        ```js
        client.on("connection-state-change", e => {
          console.log("current", e.curState, "prev", e.prevState);
        });
        ```

    - Using <Vpd k="SDK"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />
        ```js
        client.on("connection-state-change", (curState, prevState) => {
          console.log("current", curState, "prev", prevState);
        });
        ```
-   **Improve the event notification mechanism**

    The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> improves its event notification mechanism, and does not trigger channel events repeatedly.

    For example, assume that a local user A and remote users B, C, and D joins a channel at the same time, and B, C, and D all publishes their streams. If A suddenly loses connection with the channel due to bad network conditions, the SDK automatically reconnects A to the channel. While A is reconnecting to the channel, B leaves the channel and C unpublishes the stream. My question is, what events that the SDK triggers during the whole process?

    When A joins the channel, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" /> and <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> trigger the same events:

    -   Events indicating B, C, D joining the channel.

    -   Events indicating B, C, D publishing their streams.

        When A loses connection with the channel due to poor network conditions and reconnects to the channel:

    -   If A uses the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />: When A loses connection with the channel due to poor network conditions, the SDK assumes A has left the channel and clears all the states in the channel. When A successfully reconnects to the channel, it receives:

    -   Events indicating C, D joining the channel.

    -   Events indicating D publishing the stream.

        In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />, you can expect to receive the same events multiple times due to disconnection and reconnection, which may cause unexpected problems for dealing with these events on the app level. You need to listen for connection state changes and reset the states on the app level to avoid unexpected problems when receiving these events for the second time.

    -   If A uses the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />: When A loses connection with the channel due to poor network conditions, the SDK assumes that A is still in the channel and does not clear all the states in the channel. When A successfully reconnects to the channel, the SDK only sends A events that are lost during the reconnection process, including:

    -   The event indicating B leaving the channel.

    -   The event indicating C unpublishing the stream.

            The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> does not send you the same events repeatedly and ensures your app works properly during reconnection.

            As these hypothetical examples demonstrate, the event notification mechanism in the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> is more intuitive and does not need extra work.

### Stream

In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, Agora replaces the <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT_PREV_SDK}}/interfaces/agorartc.stream.html">Stream</Link> object with `Track` objects. Tracks make up a stream. You create, publish, or subscribe to one or multiple audio and video tracks to control the media stream. The advantage of dividing a stream up into tracks is that audio and video are controllable separately. Additionally, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> provides different interfaces for the local and remote tracks. Some methods and objects are only available locally, and some are only available remotely.

Listed below are the major differences on media control between the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> and <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />:

-   Enable/disable a local track: The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> replaces the `Stream.muteAudio` and `Stream.muteVideo` methods with <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/ilocaltrack.html#setenabled">ILocalTrack.setEnabled</Link> for enabling or disabling a local audio or video track. This replacement changes the following SDK behaviors:

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />, when the mute state changes, the SDK triggers the `Client.on("mute-audio")`, `Client.on("mute-video")`, `Client.on("unmute-audio")`, or `Client.on("unmute-video")` events. The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes these events. When you call `setEnabled` to enable or disable a published local track, the SDK triggers the `Client.on("user-published")` or `Client.on("user-unpublished")` events on the remote client.

-   In the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE_WEB" />, after you call `Stream.muteVideo(true)` to disable a local video stream, the camera light stays on, which might adversely impact the user experience. In contrast, if you call `setEnabled(false)` in the <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> to disable a local video track, the SDK immediately turns off the camera.

-   Set the media device:

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> replaces `Stream.switchDevice` with <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/imicrophoneaudiotrack.html#setdevice">IMicrophoneAudioTrack.setDevice</Link> and <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/icameravideotrack.html#setdevice">ICameraVideoTrack.setDevice</Link> for setting the media input device.

-   The <Vpd k="NAME"/> v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> replaces `Stream.setAudioOutput` with <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/iremoteaudiotrack.html#setplaybackdevice">IRemoteAudioTrack.setPlaybackDevice</Link> for setting the audio output device.
