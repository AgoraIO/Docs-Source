### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `GetConversationsFromServerWithPage` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). If there is no message in conversations, the SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are created. Each retrieved conversation contains one last historical message. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `LoadAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```csharp
FetchServerMessagesOption option = new FetchServerMessageOption();
  option.IsSave = false;
     option.Direction = MessageSearchDirection.UP;
     option.From = "user";
     option.MsgTypes = new List<MessageBodyType>();
     option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyType.TXT);
     option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyType.VIDEO);
     option.StartTime = 1695720454000;
     option.EndTime = 1695720554000;

     SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy(conversationId, type, cursor, pageSize, option, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
             onSuccess: (result) = >
             {
             },
             onError: (code, desc) = >
             {
             }
     ) ) ;
```

For users that do not support `GetConversationsFromServerWithPage`, call `GetConversationsFromServer` to retrieve all the conversations from the server. By default, the SDK retrieves the last ten conversations in the past seven days, and each conversation contains one last historical message. To adjust the time limit or the number of conversations retrieved, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages by pagination from the server.

If you have implemented Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores messages for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). You can store extra messages on your app server by using a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServer(conversationId, type, startId, pageSize, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
  // Fetching historical messages succeeds.
  // `result` is in the format of CursorResult<Message>.
  onSuccess: (result) => {
  },
  // Fetching historical messages fails.
  onError:(code, desc) => {
  }
));
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `RemoveMessagesFromServer` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, time, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, msgList, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server

Call `DeleteConversationFromServer` to delete conversations and their historical messages from the server. After the conversations are deleted from the server, you and other users can no longer get them from the server. If the historical messages are deleted with the conversations, all users can no longer get the messages from the server.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversationFromServer(conversationId, conversationType, isDeleteServerMessages, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```
