Audio routing refers to selection of the audio output device used for playback by your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This can include a variety of devices such as earpieces, headphones, speakers, and Bluetooth devices capable of playing audio.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios">
This page shows you how to change audio routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

Audio routing enables you to change the playback device from the default device to a selected device.

#### Default audio routing

The routing employed by the device itself, such as the speakers on a mobile device, is called the default audio routing of that device.

The SDK uses the following default audio routing in different scenarios:

- **Voice call**: Earpiece
- **Video call**: Speaker
- **Live voice call**: Speaker
- **Live video streaming**: Speaker
