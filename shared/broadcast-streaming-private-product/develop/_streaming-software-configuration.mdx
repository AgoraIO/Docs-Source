Agora recommends using one of the following stream-pushing software to push streams to Broadcast Streaming:
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com) (Open Broadcaster Software), which supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- [XSplit Broadcaster](https://www.xsplit.com/broadcaster), which supports Windows.

This page takes OBS as an example to show the configuration of the stream-pushing software.

## Prerequisites

- OBS is installed.
- The stream-pushing domain name and the stream-playing domain name are configured.
   The domain name configuration function is in beta. Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) before using it.

## Stream-pushing settings

Following these steps to configure stream-pushing settings:

1. Get the URL for pushing a stream, see [URL Construction](../develop/url-construction).
2. Open OBS, and click the **Settings** button in the widget list in the bottom right corner. ![open obs setting](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637724707399)
3. Click **Stream** in the left navigation menu in the Settings window, and choose **Custom...** in Service.
3. Fill in the Server and Stream key in accordance with the URL for pushing a stream, as shown in the following figure:

   For example, if the URL is `rtmp://push.agora.io/live/test?ts=1635004800&sign=95b0a9970c593819`, the settings are as follows:
   - Server: `rtmp://push.agora.io/live`

| Video codec types | H.264, with the encoder x264 |
| Audio codec types | AAC |
| Bitrate (kbps)  | Set the video bitrate according to the resolution and frame rate. You can refer to the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT_RTC_KIT}}/agoravideoencoderconfiguration">live bitrate</Link> column in the Video Bitrate Table. |
