<PlatformWrapper platform="react-js">
Implement the following real-time interaction quality statistics methods and audio or video state monitoring methods to understand user interaction experience:

- `network-quality`: Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality.
- `getRTCStats`: Reports real-time interaction statistics.
- `getLocalAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the sent audio stream.
- `getRemoteAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote audio stream.
- `getLocalVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the sent video stream.
- `getRemoteVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote video stream.

In your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, add the following code:

```typescript
// Retrieve and log the uplink and downlink network quality using the useNetworkQuality hook
const networkQuality = useNetworkQuality(agoraEngine);
console.log("Uplink quality:", networkQuality.uplink, " Downlink quality: ", networkQuality.downlink);

// Retrieve and log local audio statistics using getLocalAudioStats
const localAudioStats = agoraEngine.getLocalAudioStats();
console.log("Local audio stats:", localAudioStats);

// Retrieve and log local video statistics using getLocalVideoStats
const localVideoStats = agoraEngine.getLocalVideoStats();
console.log("Local video stats:", localVideoStats);

// Retrieve and log real-time channel statistics using getRTCStats
const rtcStats = agoraEngine.getRTCStats();
console.log("Channel statistics:", rtcStats);

// Retrieve and log remote user audio statistics using getRemoteAudioStats for a specific remote UID
const remoteAudioStats = agoraEngine.getRemoteAudioStats(remoteUID);
console.log("Remote user audio statistics:", remoteAudioStats);

// Retrieve and log remote user video statistics using getRemoteVideoStats for a specific remote UID
const remoteVideoStats = agoraEngine.getRemoteVideoStats(remoteUID);
console.log("Remote user video statistics:", remoteVideoStats);
```
