### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```objective-c
pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

We recommend that you retrieve 20 messages each time, with a maximum of 50. During paginated query, if the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the number of `pageSize`, the number of messages of `pageSize` will be returned. If it is less than the number of `pageSize`, the actual number will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the number of `pageSize`.

Refer to the following code sample:

```objective-c
AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption* option = [[AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption alloc] init];
    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager fetchMessagesFromServerBy:@"conversationId" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeGroupChat cursor:@"" pageSize:20 option:option completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatMessage *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager pinConversation:@"conversationId" isPinned:YES completionBlock:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```


### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```objc
// pageSize: Number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50].
// cursor: The starting position of the query. If `nil` or `@""` is passed in, the SDK will start querying from the latest pinned session.
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```


### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```objective-c
// Delete messages by timestamp
AgoraChatConversation* conversation = [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId"];
    [conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:timeToRemove completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
// Delete messages by message ID
 [conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"msgId1",@"msgId2"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages  from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```
