    1. Replace the value for `appId` with the value from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

    1. Ensure that the `channelName` is filled in. The channel name can be any string.

    1. In Android Studio, connect a physical Android device to your development machine.
    1. Click Run to start the app.
    1. A moment later you see the project installed on your device. 
    1. From the main screen of the app, select **SDK Quickstart**.

    Log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> and send messages. When you open multiple instances of the reference app and join the same channel, you receive messages sent from one instance in other instances.
