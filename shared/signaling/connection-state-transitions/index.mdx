During communication between the <Vg k="SDK" /> and the server, the connection goes through multiple states. You observe and respond to these state transitions by listening to state change event notifications.

## Understand the tech

In real-world scenarios, disruptions affect a user's network connection. These disruptions cause corresponding changes in <Vg k="SDK" />'s connection state. To maintain a seamless user experience despite these changes, the SDK ensures continuity of channel subscriptions and the temporary user status. Upon reconnecting from a disconnected state, the SDK automatically restores the previous subscriptions and the temporary user status, eliminating the need for user intervention.

This continuity assurance does not apply if you actively disconnect by logging out from <Vg k="SIG" />. Logging out clears the channel subscriptions and the temporary user status, and resets the connection state to idle. In such cases, you must log in to the server again, re-establish channel subscriptions, and restore the previous usage status.

The <Vpd k="SDK" /> handles the following connection management tasks:

* Intelligently selects the nearest edge server for access and enables quick switchover to an alternate server in case of access failure.
* Selects the appropriate connection protocol and establishes connections with the server based on user configuration. To ensure service availability, <Vg k="SIG" /> employs a dual-protocol link mechanism and maintains both TCP and UDP connections simultaneously.
* Manages and preserves channel subscriptions and ensures continuity of temporary user status upon recovery from a temporary disconnection.
* Promptly notifies users of connection state changes to facilitate timely observation and response to a specific state change. This feature empowers you to enhance user experience through logical interventions at the business level.

## Connection states

This section describes the various connection states and their transitions in both message and stream channels.

### Message channel connection states

To use a message channel, you initialize the SDK and log in to initiate a connection with the server. In case of an unexpected interruption, the SDK automatically makes attempts to restore the connection at increasing time intervals (2, 4, 8, 16... seconds) for up to 2 minutes. If the attempts are still unsuccessful, the SDK transitions to a long suspended state and retries at fixed 30-second intervals.

The following table gives an overview of the various connection states:
