### Publish

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">

Publishing is the act of sending a user’s audio or video data to the channel. Usually, the published stream is created by the audio data sampled from a microphone or the video data captured by a camera. You can also publish media streams from other sources, such as an online music file or the user’s screen.

After successfully publishing a stream, the SDK uses it to send media data to other users in the channel. Users communicate with each other in real-time by publishing local streams and subscribing to remote streams.
