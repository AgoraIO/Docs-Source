### Adjust the playback Volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```cpp
int volume = 50;
int uid = 123456;
// Set the local playback volume for all remote users 
mRtcEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
// Set the local playback volume for a specific remote user. For example, user 123456
mRtcEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid, volume)
```

### Adust the recording volume
Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```cpp
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
int vol = 50;
m_rtcEngine->adjustRecordingSignalVolume(vol);
```
<Admonition type="info" title="note">When using the recording device to capture audio signals, the SDK defaults to a device volume of `85`. A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device. If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device. The volume of the recording device affects the global volume of the device. If the volume of the recording device does not meet your needs, you can adjust the recording volume by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.</Admonition>

### Get volume information of users

<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback.  You use the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

```cpp
// Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
// their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
void CAudioVolumeEventHandler::onAudioVolumeIndication(const AudioVolumeInfo* speakers, unsigned int speakerNumber, int totalVolume){
}
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note" style="background-color:yellow">Call `enableAudioVolumeIndication` to enable reporting of users' volume indication in the callback.</Admonition>
