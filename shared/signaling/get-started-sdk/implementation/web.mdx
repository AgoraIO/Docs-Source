1.  **Declare the variables to create an <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance**

    You use these objects to communicate with <Vg k="MESS" />.

    ``` typescript
    // The Signaling RTMEngine instance
    let signalingEngine = null;
    let signalingChannel = null;
    let uid = "";
    ```

1.  **Declare the variables to join a channel**

    Best practice is to keep these variables in a separate configuration file.

    ``` typescript
    "uid": "<your username>",
    "appId": "<your appID>",
    "channelName": "<your channel name>",
    "token": "<your RTM token>"
    ```


3.  **Configure a <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance**

    Your code reads the parameters from the configuration file.

    ``` typescript
        // Create an Agora RTM instance
        signalingEngine = AgoraRTM.createInstance(config.appId);
    ```

4.  **Handle and respond to  <Vg k="MESS" /> events**

    For pub-sub, you check if people are talking to your user.

    ``` typescript
    // signalingEngine Event listeners
    // Display messages from peer
    signalingEngine.on("MessageFromPeer", function (message, peerId) {
      messageCallback("Received peer message from " + peerId + ": " + message.text);
    });

    // Display connection state changes
    signalingEngine.on("ConnectionStateChanged", function (state, reason) {
      messageCallback("Connection state changed to: " + state + ", Reason: " + reason);
    });
    ```

1.  **Login to <Vg k="MESS" />**

      Signaling, each token is specific to a user ID. If `uid` and `token` do not match, your user cannot login.

      ``` typescript
      const login = async () => {
        signalingEngine.login({ uid: uid, token: config.token });
      };
      ```


1.  **Send a messages**

    Messages are sent directly to the UID of another user.

    ``` typescript
    await signalingEngine
      .sendMessageToPeer({ text: peerMessage }, peerId)
      .then((sendResult) => {
        if (sendResult.hasPeerReceived) {
          messageCallback("Message received by " + peerId + ": " + peerMessage);
        } else {
          messageCallback("Message sent to: " + peerId + ": " + peerMessage);
        }
    });
    ```

    You setup the event handlers for messages received from other users during <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> initiation.


1.  **Logout of <Vg k="MESS" />**

    Had enough of the conversation? Just logout.

    ``` java
    const logout = async () => {
      signalingEngine.logout();
    };
    ```

You have just implemented the <Vg k="MESS" /> workflow. Yes, it's as easy as that.
