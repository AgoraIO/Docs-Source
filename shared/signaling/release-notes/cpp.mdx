v1.4.1 was released on September 30, 2020.

**Improvements**

Improved the log file.


### v1.4.0

v1.4.0 was released on September 1, 2020.

**Compatibility changes**

- You need to add new ports to the firewall whitelist. See [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).
    - New TCP ports: 8443, 9136, 9137, 9141. New UDP port: 8443. Reason: Support real-time transport encryption.
    - New UDP ports: 8130, 9120, 9121. Reason: Support UDP path to improve the SDK's performance in sub-optimal network conditions.
    - New UDP port: 9700. Reason: Support data reporting.
- In `setLogFileSize`, the default log file size increases from 512 KB to 10 MB. The maximum log file size increases from 10 MB to 1 GB.

**New features**

- Geofencing. You can call `setRtmServiceContext` to set the region of the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> can only connect to Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> servers within the specified region.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

**Improvements**

- Improved the success rate of login and message delivery of the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> in poor network conditions.
- The call frequency limit has increased for the following operations. See [Limitations](../reference/limitations).

| Operation                                 | Call frequency limit change                                  |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Send peer-to-peer or channel messages     | Increased from 300 calls every three seconds to 1,500 calls every three seconds |
| Query user online status                  | Increased from 20 calls every five seconds to 100 calls every five seconds |
| Add, delete, or update user attributes    | Increased from 20 calls every five seconds to 100 calls every five seconds |
| Query user attributes                     | Increased from 80 calls every five seconds to 400 calls every five seconds |
| Add, delete, or update channel attributes | Increased from 20 calls every five seconds to 100 calls every five seconds |
| Query channel attributes                  | Increased from 80 calls every five seconds to 400 calls every five seconds |

### v1.3.0

v1.3.0 was released on June 12.

**Compatibility changes**

- You need to add a new TCP port, 9140, to the firewall whitelist. The port is for sending and receiving image or file messages. See [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).
- The Agora server blocks any file message or image message that you send to <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> 1.2.2 or earlier, or to the Signaling SDK.

**New features**

#### 1. Send and receive file messages or image messages

You can call `createFileMessageByUploading` or `createImageMessageByUploading` to upload non-empty files or image files no greater than 30 MB. Each uploaded file or image stays in the Agora server for seven days. The SDK returns a media ID as the unique indentifier of the file or image file. You can use the `IFileMessage` class or the `IImageMessage` class to save the media ID. The `IFileMessage` class and the `IImageMessage` class inherit from the `IMessage` class, so you can send and receive file or image messages via peer-to-peer or channel message methods. You can call `downloadMediaToMemory` or `downloadMediaToFile` to download the received file or image file.

#### 2. Manage upload or download tasks

You can call `cancelMediaUpload` or `cancelMediaDownload` to cancel an upload or download task. You also can use the `onMediaUploadingProgress` callback or the `onMediaDownloadingProgress` callback to return upload or download progress.

**Improvements**

The call limits of the following operations have increased. See [Limitations](../reference/limitations).

| Operation                                 | Call limit increase                                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Send peer-to-peer or channel messages     | From 180 calls every three seconds to 300 calls every three seconds |
| Query user online status                  | From 10 calls every five seconds to 20 calls every five seconds |
| Add, delete, or update user attributes    | From 10 calls every five seconds to 20 calls every five seconds |
| Query user attributes                     | From 40 calls every five seconds to 80 calls every five seconds |
| Add, delete, or update channel attributes | From 10 calls every five seconds to 20 calls every five seconds |
| Query channel attributes                  | From 10 calls every five seconds to 80 calls every five seconds |

**Fixed issues**

- Login failure caused by the SDK's incorrect identification of user's network type.
- Other problems that may cause the system to crash.

Use <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_channel.html?transId=82687bd0-ac53-11ea-aa07-c5bcc14a9a95#a056dfe9e83c168c3c94e47a017a6ec3f">sendMessage (const IMessage *message, const SendMessageOptions &options)</Link> instead.

### v1.2.2

v1.2.2 was released on December 13, 2019.


**Compatibility Changes**

This release deprecates the <code>createAgoraService</code> method, which creates an <code>IAgoraService</code> instance, and the <code>initialize</code> method, which initializes the created <code>IAgoraService</code> instance.  As of this relase, you only need to call the <code>createRtmService</code> method and the <code>initialize</code> method to initialize it before being able to call its functions.


**Issues Fixed**

Occasionally fails to receive any callback after a channel attribute operation.

### v1.2.1

v1.2.1 was released on November 29, 2019.

**New Feature**

*Compatible with the endCall method of the Agora Signaling SDK*

If you use the `sendMessageToPeer` method to send a <i>text</i> message in the format of AgoraRTMLegacyEndcallCompatibleMessagePrefix_\<channelId\>_\<your additional information\>, then this method is compatible with the endCall method of the legacy Agora Signaling SDK. Replace \<channelId\> with the channel ID from which you want to leave (end call), and replace \<your additional information\> with any additional information. Note that you must not put any "_" (underscore) in your additional information but you can set \<your additional information\> as empty "".

**Issues Fixed**


- The SDK fails to reconnect to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system if the user disables VPN.
- If a channel member reconnects to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> server after being interrupted, chances are the rest members of the channel can receive `onMemberJoined` twice.

### v1.2.0

v1.2.0 was released on November 6, 2019.

**Compatibility Changes**

Deprecated the `isOnline` property of the `PeerOnlineStatus`. Use `onlineState` instead.


**New Features**

#### Subscribe to the online status of the specified user(s)

When the method call succeeds, the SDK returns the onPeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report the online status of peers, to whom you subscribe.
When the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes, the SDK returns the onPeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed.
If the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes when the SDK is reconnecting to the server, the SDK returns the onPeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed when successfully reconnecting to the server.

#### Unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s)

Allows you to unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s).

#### Get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed

Allows you to get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed.

#### Create a raw message

Creates and initializes a raw message to be sent.

 If you set a text description, ensure that the size of the raw message and the description combined does not exceed 32 KB.

### v1.1.0

v1.1.0 was released on October 14, 2019. It adds the following features:

- [Gets the member count of specified channel(s).](#getcount)
- [Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel](#oncount)
- [Channel attribute operations](#channelattributes)



**Compatibility Changes**

1. Deprecates the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_rtm_service.html#afec5391fa9c4ec2bfe9ac4e684705600">sendMessageToPeer</Link> method, and uses <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_rtm_service.html#a08c1b3d444af5a2778ede48e4c677a52">sendMessageToPeer(const char \*, const IMessage \*, const SendMessageOptions \&)</Link> instead.
2. The <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_message.html#ac7427e3a49bd44e53b2809e0b39511b6">getServerReceivedTs</Link>  method of the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_message.html">IMessage</Link> object supports both peer-to-peer and channel messages.
3. Timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message is 10 seconds from this release, compared to 5 seconds in previous versions. See <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/namespaceagora_1_1rtm.html#ac7c591aac4ca6867e239c8bcccc1fc5ca231d49ed8da45aa4be794cfe927703dc">PEER_MESSAGE_ERR_SENT_TIMEOUT</Link>.
4. Puts a limit on the frequency of  <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_channel.html#a6a54cdd8e5db526514e0ca84aa9cba4c">join</Link> the same channel: <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/namespaceagora_1_1rtm.html#adeb91ade364eddd742d8f3ad59c6638ea02250c14972ba934c148fc3d558baa6f">Two times every five seconds</Link>.

**New Features**

<a name="getcount"></a>
#### 1. Gets the member count of specified channel(s).

You can now get the member count of specified channel(s) without the need to join, by calling the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_rtm_service.html#a41dee47c6201acb2f29371b6e30249a5">getChannelMemberCount</Link> method. You can get the member counts of a maximum of 32 channels in one method call.

<a name="oncount"></a>
#### 2. Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel

If you are already in a channel, you do not have to call the `getChannelMemberCount` method to get the member count of the current channel. We also do not recommend using `onMemberJoined` and `onMemberLeft` to keep track of the member counts. As of this release, the SDK returns to the channel members <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_channel_event_handler.html#aff85052bb2a46c3220789c1ef90aa01e">onMemberCountUpdated</Link> the latest channel member count when the number of channel members changes. Note that:

- When the number of channel members ≤ 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once per second.
- When the number of channel members exceeds 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once every three seconds.



> Please treat this callback and the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_channel_event_handler.html#a5e3f5a5ae0b3861de2f0310841ad0b37">onGetMembers</Link> callback separately:
> - The former is an automatic callback. It returns the current numer of channel members;
> - The latter is triggered by the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_channel.html#a3f9c943059ac48a568c81798da38c3cb">getMembers</Link> method. It returns a member list of the current channel. If the number of channel members exceeds 512, the SDK only returns a list of 512 randomly-selected channel members.

<a name="channelattributes"></a>
#### 3. Channel attribute operations

Supports setting or getting the attribute(s) of a specified channel. You can use this feature to create group anouncement.

Each channel attribute comes as a key-value pair. See <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_rtm_channel_attribute.html">IRtmChannelAttribute</Link> for more information. Where:

- The key of each channel attribute must be visible characters and not exceed 8 KB.
- Each channel attribute must not exceed 8 KB in length.
- The overall size of the attributes of a channel must not exceed 32 KB.
- The number of attributes of a channel must not exceed 32.

Specific features:

- Sets the attributes of a specified channel with new ones.
- Adds or updates the attribute(s) of a specified channel.
- Deletes the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.
- Clears all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.

When updating attributes of a channel, you can use the  <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/structagora_1_1rtm_1_1_channel_attribute_options.html#a9a29721df90beca76974a5e348902530">enableNotificationToChannelMembers</Link> flag to decide whether or not to notify all members of the channel about this attribute change.

> The SDK caches the channel attributes. If multiple users have the privilege to update the channel attributes, then we recommend calling the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/classagora_1_1rtm_1_1_i_rtm_service.html#a3dc8409ed82d8f95a0839d5e9e7da564">getChannelAttributes</Link> to update the cache before updating the channel attributes.

**Improvements**

#### Resends peer-to-peer messages

This release improves the resending mechanism of peer-to-peer messages, and extends the timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message from five to 10 seconds, greatly improving the success rate of peer-to-peer message sending under weak network conditions.

#### Caches channel messages

The Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system will resend a maximum of 32 channel messages of up to 30 seconds to channel members, when they manage to reconnect to the system from poor network conditions. This greatly improves the overall arrival rate of channel messages under weak network conditions.

### v1.0.1

v1.0.1 was released on August 1st, 2019.

**Issues Fixed**

- When the connection to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system is interrupted, the SDK does not return the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback.

### v1.0.0

v1.0.0 was released on July 24th, 2019.

**New Features**

#### Interconnects with the legacy Agora Signaling SDK

v1.0.0 implements the `ILocalCallinvitation::setChannelId` and `ILocalCallinvitation::getChannelId` methods.

> - To intercommunicate with the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, you MUST set the channel ID. However, even if the callee successfully accepts the call invitation, the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> does not join the channel of the specified channel ID.
> - If your App does not involve the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, we recommend using the `ILocalCallInvitation::setContent` method or the `IRemoteCallInvitation::setResponse` method to set customized contents.

#### Specifies the default path to the SDK log file

Supports changing the default path to the SDK log file using the `setLogFile` method. To avoid creating an incomplete log file, we recommend calling this method once you have created and initialized an `IRtmService` instance.



#### Sets the output log level of the SDK

Supports setting the output log level of the SDK using the `setLogFilter` method.  The log level follows the sequence of OFF, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, and INFO. Choose a level to see the logs preceding that level. If, for example, you set the log level to WARNING, you see the logs within levels CRITICAL, ERROR, and WARNING. See also <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_WIN_CPP}}/namespaceagora_1_1rtm.html#af515252477afb2a71feef88113dfa481">LOG_FILTER_TYPE</Link>.

> You can call this method once you have created and initializd an `IRtmService` instance. You do not have to call this method after calling the `login` method.

#### Sets the log file size in KB

Supports setting the log file size using the `setLogFileSize` method. The log file has a default size of 512 KB. File size settings of less than 512 KB or greater than 10 MB will not take effect.


> You can call this method once you have created and initializd an `IRtmService` instance. You do not have to call this method after calling the `login` method.

**Improvements**

Adds error codes based on the following scenarios:

- The Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> service is not initialized.
- The method call frequency exceeds the limit.
- The user does not call the `login` method or the method call of `login` does not succeed before calling any of the <Vg k="MESS" /> core APIs.

**Issues Fixed**

- One can log in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system with a static App ID and an <Vg k="MESS" /> token, which is generated from a dynamic App ID.

### v0.9.3

v0.9.3 was released on June 7th, 2019.

**New Features**

#### Sends an (offline) peer-to-peer message to a specified user (receiver)

This version allows you to send a message to a specified user when he/she is offline. If you set a message as an offline message and the specified user is offline when you send it, the <Vg k="MESS" /> server caches it. Please note that for now we only cache 200 offline messages for up to seven days for each receiver. When the number of the cached messages reaches this limit, the newest message overrides the oldest one.


#### User attribute-related operations

This version allows you to set or update a user's attributes. You can:

- Substitutes the local user's attributes with new ones.
- Adds or updates the local user's attribute(s).
- Deletes the local user's attributes using attribute keys.
- Clears all attributes of the local user.
- Gets all attributes of a specified user.
- Gets the attributes of a specified user using attribute keys.

> - Only after you successfully loggin in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system can you execute user attribute-related operations. Otherwise, the SDK triggers the `ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_ERR_NOT_READY` error code.
> - The attributes you set will be clears when you log out of the <Vg k="MESS" /> system.
> - You can only set a maximum of 16 KB attributes in a single method call. Otherwise, the SDK triggers the `ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_ERR_SIZE_OVERFLOW` error code.

**Improvements**

- Supports creating an <Vg k="MESS" /> channel before logging in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system.
- Supports creating multiple <Vg k="MESS" /> channels. But a user can only join a maximum of 20 <Vg k="MESS" /> channels at the same time. When the number of the joined channels exceeds 20, the SDK triggers the `JOIN_CHANNEL_ERR_FAILURE` error code.

**Issues Fixed**

- Occasional system crashes.
- A user who has logged out of the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system appears online to the other users until 30 seconds later.

### v0.9.2

v0.9.2 was released on May 8th, 2019.

**New Features**

- Queries the Online Status of the Specified Users.
-  Renews the Token.

**Improvements**

-  Supports a `userId` that starts with a space.
