The `LocalAudioTrack` class is the base class for the local audio track.

### `set_enabled`

Enables or disables the local audio track. After the local audio track is enabled, the SDK can capture, process, and encode local audio.

```python
def set_enabled(self, enable)
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`enable`|Whether to enable the audio track: - `1`: Enable the audio track. - `0`: Disable the audio track.|

### `adjust_publish_volume`

Adjusts the audio publishing volume.

```python
def adjust_publish_volume(self, volume)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `volume` | The audio publishing volume. The value range is from [0,100]. `0` means mute, and `100` means the original volume. |

#### Returns

- 0: Success.
- < 0: Failure.

### `set_max_buffer_audio_frame_number`

Sets the maximum capacity of the audio sending buffer.

```python
def set_max_buffer_audio_frame_number(self, num)
```

In AI interaction applications, the frequency of sending audio frames by the sender may be uneven, for example, sending 1 frame every 20 ms or 3 frames every 20 ms. If the SDK sends data according to the actual sending frequency to the Agora server, the receiver may experience stuttering or frame loss. To optimize the audio transmission performance, the SDK sets an audio sending buffer. Regardless of the actual sending frequency of audio frames by the sender, the SDK stores data in the audio sending buffer. After the data in the audio sending buffer reaches the minimum allowed sending time, the SDK starts sending data to the receiver at a frequency of 10 ms per frame.

The default maximum capacity of the audio sending buffer is 6000, which means it can store up to 6000 frames of data, or 60 seconds of data. If you need a larger buffer capacity, you can call this method to adjust it. If you also need to set the minimum allowed sending time for the audio sending buffer, call the [`set_send_delay_ms`](#setsenddelayms) method.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
This method must be called before the [`publish_audio`](./localuser#publishaudio) method.
</Admonition>

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `num` | The maximum number of audio frames that the buffer can store. For example, if you enter 6000, it means 6000 frames of audio data. |


### `clear_sender_buffer`

Clears the current audio sending buffer.

```python
def clear_sender_buffer(self)
```

If you no longer need the data in the current audio sending buffer, call this method to clear the buffer. For example, a user asks AI a question, and AI is answering the question through the SDK. At this time, the audio sending buffer of the SDK is constantly receiving and sending data. When the user interrupts AI's reply and asks another question, you can call this method to clear the buffered data that has not been sent out, so that the SDK can quickly buffer the AI's response to the new topic.

#### Returns

- 0: Success.
- < 0: Failure.

### `set_send_delay_ms`

Sets the minimum data duration that the audio sending buffer allows to send.

```python
def set_send_delay_ms(self, delay_ms:int)
```

The default minimum data duration that the SDK allows to send is 160 ms, which means the SDK waits until the audio sending buffer is filled with 160 ms of data before sending the data to the receiver. This will have the following effects:

- If the sender sends data that is greater than or equal to 160 ms, for example 800 ms, the SDK sends the data at a frequency of 10 ms per frame.
- If the sender sends data that is less than 160 ms, for example 100 ms, the SDK waits until the buffer data reaches 160 ms before sending the data at a frequency of 10 ms per frame. This will cause a delay of up to 60 ms.

You can adjust the minimum data duration according to your actual business needs by calling this method.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `delay_ms` | The minimum data duration that the buffer allows to send (ms). This parameter must be set to a multiple of 10, and its value must be greater than 0 and less than 10 times the value of the `number` parameter in the [`set_max_buffer_audio_frame_number`](#setmaxbufferaudioframenumber) method. |

### `release`

Releases the local audio track resources.

```python
def release(self)
```
