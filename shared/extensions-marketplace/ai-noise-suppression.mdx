    - Beeps and clapping sounds.
    - Music
    - Reverberation
    - Howling

- **Noise reduction strategies**

    The <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension supports the following noise reduction strategies:
    - **Default**: Reduces noise to a comfortable level without distorting the human voice.
    - **Custom**: If you need a more enhanced or custom noise reduction strategy for your business scenario, [submit a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to Agora technical support.


## Understand the tech

<Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> accesses voice data when it is captured from the user's local device, modifies it, then plays the updated data to local and remote video channels.

## Prerequisites

To use the <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension, you must meet the following requirements:

- Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.
- [Noise type](#type) matches your business scenario.  For example, if you want the microphone to collect background music, the extension is not applicable because it categorizes such background music as noise.
<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- You have the latest version of Desktop Chrome (recommended), Edge, or Firefox.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
- Minimum device requirements
    - iOS iPhone 6S
    - iPadOS
    - iPad Pro (2nd generation)
    - iPad mini (5th generation)
    - iPad Air (3rd generation)
    - macOS MacBook Pro 2015
- Ensure that the dynamical extension library `AgoraAiNoiseSuppressionExtension.xcframework` is integrated into your project.

When <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> is enabled, if <Vg k="VSDK" /> detects that the device performance is not sufficient, it:

- Disables <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />
- Enables traditional noise reduction
- Throws the -1054(WARN_APM_AINS_CLOSED) error code.
