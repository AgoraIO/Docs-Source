Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Obtain a temporary token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1. In `JoinChannel.cs`, update `_appID`, `_channelName`, and `_token` with the app ID, channel name, and temporary token for your project.

1. In Unity Editor, click **Play** to run your project. 

1. Click **Join** to join a channel.

1. Invite a friend to run the demo <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> on a second device. Use the same `_appID_`, `_token`, and `_channelName` to join. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel.

    After your friend joins successfully, you can hear and see each other.
