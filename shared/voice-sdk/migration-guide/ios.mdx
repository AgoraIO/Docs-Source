## Migration steps

This section introduces the main steps to upgrade the SDK from v3.6.2 to v4.0.0 Beta.


### 1. Integrate the SDK

    See [Product overview](../get-started/get-started-sdk) for more information about integrating the v4.0.0 Beta SDK into your project.


### 2. Update the Agora code in your app

    The v4.0.0 Beta SDK has optimized or modified the implementation of some functions, resulting in incompatibility with the v3.6.2 SDK. In order to retain Agora functionality in your app, update the code in your app according to [What has changed](../overview/migration-guide).


## What has changed

This section introduces the main changes of v4.0.0 Beta compared to v3.6.2 in the following categories. You need to update the code of your app according to your business scenario.


* Breaking changes: Introduces API compatibility changes that have a big impact. You need to spend significant time modifying the related implementation.
* Behavior changes: Introduces changes caused by reasonable optimization of the SDK default behavior and API behavior. Less time is required to modify the related implementation, if any.
* Function gaps: Introduces functions that were supported in v3.6.2 but are not supported in v4.0.0 Beta. However, these functions are intended to be added in a future release.
* Removed APIs: Introduces APIs that were supported in v3.6.2 but removed in v4.0.0 Beta. Most of these APIs have alternatives in v4.0.0 Beta. Modifying the related implementation should require less time.
* Naming and data type changes: Introduces the naming and data type changes of the main APIs. You can update the relevant implementation according to the error message in the IDE, which is expected to take less time.


### Breaking changes

After upgrading from v3.6.2 to v4.0.0 Beta, the way the APIs implement some functions is different. This section introduces compatibility changes for these APIs and the logic for updating the code of your app.


#### Multiple channels

In v3.6.2, the SDK provides the AgoraRtcChannel and AgoraRtcChannelDelegate classes to implement multi-channel control. The v3.6.2 SDK supports subscribing to the audio and video streams of multiple channels, but only supports publishing one group of audio and video streams in one channel.

v4.0.0 Beta introduces the following changes:



* The SDK supports capturing or publishing multiple groups of audio and video streams at the same time. For example, simultaneously publishing video streams captured by multiple cameras or multiple screens.
* The SDK retains the following behavior of AgoraRtcEngineKit: you can call joinChannelExByToken (replacing joinChannelByToken of the AgoraRtcChannel class in v3.6.2) multiple times, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user IDs (localUid) and AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions settings.
* Added a binary group AgoraRtcConnection to represent the connection established by joinChannelExByToken. A connection is determined by the channel name (channelId) and localUid. You can control the publishing and subscribing state of different connections through AgoraRtcConnection. The SDK adds Ex in the name of all APIs with a connection parameter (corresponding to the AgoraRtcConnection class) to distinguish them, and gathers these APIs in the AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex) class to implement more multi-stream functions.

By setting AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions, v4.0.0 Beta supports using one AgoraRtcEngineKit instance to capture audio and video streams from multiple sources at the same time and publish them to the remote user, adapting to various business scenarios. For example:



* Simultaneously publish a media player stream, a screen-sharing stream, and a video stream captured by the camera.
* Simultaneously publish one audio stream captured by the microphone and one by the custom audio source, and one media player steam.

Combined with the multi-channel capability, you can also experience the following functions:



* Publish multiple groups of audio and video streams to the remote user through different localUids.
* Mix multiple audio streams and publish them to the remote user through one localUid.
* Mix multiple video streams and publish them to the remote user through one localUid.

AgoraRtcChannel and AgoraRtcEngineKit of v3.6.2 are partially duplicated and overlap in their functionality, so v4.0.0 Beta hides the AgoraRtcChannel and AgoraRtcChannelDelegate classes. See the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/JoinMultiChannel">JoinMultiChannel</Link> sample project for more details on how to replace AgoraRtcChannel with joinChannelExByToken and AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions. The expected migration cost is one day or less.

If you need to continue to use the AgoraRtcChannel and AgoraRtcChannelDelegate classes, contact support@agora.io. The decision whether to maintain compatibility in a future release is based on your feedback.


#### Media stream publishing control

In v3.6.2, the SDK uses the publishLocalAudio and publishLocalVideo members in AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions to control the audio and video publishing state in the channel.

In v4.0.0 Beta, the SDK gathers more channel-related settings into AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions, including publishing of audio and video streams from different sources, automatic subscribing of audio and video streams, user role switching, token updating, and default dual stream options. You can determine the media stream publishing and subscribing behavior by calling joinChannelByToken or joinChannelExByToken when joining a channel, or you can flexibly update the media options by calling updateChannelWithMediaOptions after joining achannel, such as switching video sources.

See the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Basic/JoinChannelVideo">JoinChannelVideo</Link> sample project to update the code in your app.


#### Custom video source and renderer

In v3.6.2, the SDK provides the following ways to implement the custom video source and renderer:



* Push mode for custom video source
* Raw video data mode for custom video renderer
* MediaIO mode (AgoraVideoSourceProtocol) for custom video source
* MediaIO mode (AgoraVideoSinkProtocol) for custom video renderer

v4.0.0 Beta unifies the audio and video processing pipeline internally. Push mode and raw video data mode are simpler for integration, so Agora recommends using them for custom video source and renderer and removes the following related APIs of the MediaIO mode:



* AgoraVideoSourceProtocal
* AgoraVideoSinkProtocal
* AgoraVideoFrameConsumer
* setVideoSource
* setLocalVideoRenderer
* setRemoteVideoRenderer
* videoSource
* localVideoRenderer
* remoteVideoRendererOfUserId

If you use the MediaIO mode in v3.6.2 to implement custom video source, custom video renderer, switching video source, and other functions, Agora recommends updating the code of your app by referring to the following sample projects:



* Custom video source: <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/CustomVideoSourcePush">CustomVideoSourcePush</Link>
* Custom video renderer: <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/CustomVideoRender">CustomVideoRender</Link>
* Switching video source: <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/ScreenShare">ScreenShare</Link>


#### Error codes and warning codes

In v3.6.2, the SDK returns error codes and warning codes through the didOccurError and didOccurWarning callbacks.

To facilitate locating and troubleshooting issues, v4.0.0 Beta reports problems and causes through the return values of APIs or different callbacks for listening to states. For example:



* connectionChangedToState: Reports the network connection state.
* localAudioStateChanged: Reports the local audio state.
* localVideoStateChangedOfState: Reports the local video state.
* remoteAudioStateChangedOfUid: Reports the remote audio state.
* remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid: Reports the remote video state.

As a consequence, v4.0.0 Beta removes the didOccurError and didOccurWarning callbacks.


### Behavior changes

This section introduces changes caused by reasonable optimization of the SDK default behavior and API behavior.


#### Channel profile

In v3.6.2, the default channel profile is AgoraChannelProfileCommunication (the communication profile).

Because the interactive streaming profile supports seamless switching from one-to-one calls to multi-user interaction, since v3.0.0, Agora has changed the internal transmission protocol and the ability to resist poor network conditions in the communication profile to be consistent with the interactive streaming profile. In v4.0.0 Beta, Agora also changed the default channel profile to AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting (the interactive streaming profile).


#### Network quality callback

In v3.6.2, if the uid parameter returned in networkQuality is 0, the callback reports the network quality of the local user. In v4.0.0 Beta, the uid of the local user returned in this callback is the same as the local user's actual uid in the channel.


#### Default log file

In v3.6.2, when the SDK creates multiple log files, the earlier files are named in a agorasdk_x.log format, such as agorasdk_1.log. v4.0.0 Beta modified the naming format to agorasdk.x.log, such as agorasdk.1.log. Additionally, v4.0.0 Beta adds the agoraapi.log file to record API logs.


#### Fast channel switching

In v3.6.2, you need to call switchChannel to quickly switch a channel.

In v4.0.0 Beta, you can achieve the same switching speed as switchChannel in v3.6.2 by switching a channel through leaveChannel and joinChannelByToken. Therefore, v4.0.0 Beta removes switchChannel. If you call switchChannel to quickly switch a channel in v3.6.2, see the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/QuickSwitchChannel">QuickSwitchChannel</Link> sample project to update the code in your app.


### Function gaps

This section introduces functions that were supported in v3.6.2 but are no longer supported or behave inconsistently in v4.0.0 Beta. Plans exist to support them or make them consistent in a future release, however.


#### Audio application scenarios

v4.0.0 Beta reconstructs the audio application scenarios, which can replace most of the audio application scenarios of v3.6.2. The following table shows the correspondence of audio application scenarios in the two releases:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>v3.6.2</strong></td>
   <td><strong>v4.0.0 Beta</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioDefault</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioDefault</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomEntertainment</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioEducation</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioDefault</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming or AgoraAudioScenarioHighDefinition</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioShowRoom</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioDefault</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoomGaming</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioIot</td>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioDefault</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting</td>
   <td>None</td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Audio route

The following table shows the differences in the behavior of APIs related to the audio route between v3.6.2 and v4.0.0 Beta:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>API</strong></td>
   <td><strong>v3.6.2</strong></td>
   <td><strong>v4.0.0 Beta</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>setDefaultAudioRouteToSpeakerphone</td>
   <td>You can only set the audio route before joining a channel.<p/>This method only controls the initial state of the audio route and does not change the default audio route of the system. For example, regardless of whether you set the parameter of setDefaultAudioRouteToSpeakerphone to YES or NO, calling setEnableSpeakerphone(NO) changes the audio route to the earpiece.</td>
   <td>You can set the audio route either before or after joining a channel.<p/>This method is a steady API and can change the default audio route of the system. For example, after calling setDefaultAudioRouteToSpeakerphone(YES) to set the initial audio route to the speakerphone, calling setEnableSpeakerphone(NO) cannot change the audio route to the earpiece.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>setEnableSpeakerphone</td>
   <td>After connecting external playback devices such as Bluetooth and wired headphones, calling setEnableSpeakerphone cannot switch the audio route to the speakerphone or earpiece.</td>
   <td>Not recommended.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Also, when an external playback device is removed, for example, by disconnecting the Bluetooth headset, the audio route change is different between v3.6.2 and v4.0.0 Beta:


* In v3.6.2, the audio route changes as follows (in terms of priority): The external device connected next to last (if any) > ... > The external device connected first > setEnableSpeakerphone > setDefaultAudioRoutetoSpeakerphone > The default audio route.
* In v4.0.0 Beta, the audio route changes as follows (in terms of priority): The external device connected next to last (if any) > ... > The external device connected first > setDefaultAudioRoutetoSpeakerphone > The default audio route.


#### Default video bitrate

In v3.6.2, if you set the video bitrate in AgoraVideoEncoderConfiguration as AgoraVideoBitrateStandard, the default video bitrate in the AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting profile is twice that of the AgoraChannelProfileCommunication profile.

In v4.0.0 Beta, the video bitrate in the AgoraChannelProfileCommunication profile is the same as that in the AgoraChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting profile, which means the video bitrate in the AgoraChannelProfileCommunication profile is doubled.


#### Virtual background

v4.0.0 Beta modifies the calling logic of enableVirtualBackground. Before calling enableVirtualBackground, you need to do the following:



1. Integrate the AgoraVideoSegmentationExtension.xcframework dynamic library in the project.
2. Call enableExtension("agora_segmentation", "PortraitSegmentation", "YES") before joining a channel to enable the virtual background extension.
3. Call enableVideo to enable the video module.

See the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/VideoProcess">VideoProcess</Link> sample project to update the code in your app.


#### Image enhancement

v4.0.0 Beta modifies the calling logic of setBeautyEffectOptions. Before calling setBeautyEffectOptions, you need to do the following:



1. Integrate the AgoraVideoProcessExtension.xcframework dynamic library in the project.
2. Call enableExtension ("agora", "beauty", "YES") before joining a channel to enable the image enhancement extension.
3. Call enableVideo to enable the video module.

See the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.AGORA_API_EXAMPLES_IOS_TREE}}/Advanced/VideoProcess">VideoProcess</Link> sample project to update the code in your app.
