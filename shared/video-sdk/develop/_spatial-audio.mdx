Spatial audio brings theater-like effects to <Vpd k="NAME" /> making it seem as if the sound originates from all around the user. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides spatial audio effects that give users an immersive audio experience in scenarios such as e-sports competitions and online conferences. Using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

You can configure the following spatial audio effects:

* **Spatial audio effects for users**:

    By setting the local and remote user's spatial positions, you can create an environment that enables users to experience changes in the distance, position, and orientation of other users in real-time. You can also enable your users to experience multiple audio effects such as audio blurring and air absorption.

* **Spatial audio effects for media player**:

    By updating the spatial position of the media player, you can add a sense of space to media resources such as background sounds and musical accompaniment. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides local cartesian coordinate system calculation solution for the media player. This solution calculates the relative positions of the local user and the media player through the <Vpd k="SDK" />. You update the spatial coordinates of the local user and the media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the media player.


## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

* Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>
<Prerequisites />

* To ensure a true spatial experience, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends using an audio device that supports true binaural playback.


## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to implement spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the project you created in <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

<ProjectSetup />

## Add spatial audio to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented spatial audio features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
