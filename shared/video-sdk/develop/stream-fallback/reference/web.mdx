### Limitations

Media stream fallback has the following limitations:

- The `enableDualStream` method is not applicable to audio-only call scenarios.

- Consider the following limitations on mobile devices:

    - It is not possible to send high and low resolution streams using `h264` encoding on Android Chrome.
    - When sending a low resolution stream on iOS Safari and setting video properties using `setLowStreamParameter`, the `bitrate` setting is not supported. The small stream resolution must be proportional to the large stream resolution.
    - Some browsers are not fully compatible with dual-stream mode when using the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method. Known issues include:
        - macOS Safari: The frame rate and resolution of high- and low-resolution streams are the same.
        - iOS Safari 11: Switching between high- and low-resolution streams is not supported.
        - Firefox: The frame rate of low-resolution streams is fixed at 30 fps.
