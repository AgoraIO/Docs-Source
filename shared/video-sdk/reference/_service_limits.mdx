Agora imposes the following limits on PCU (Peak Concurrent Users), PCW (Per-Channel Workrate), and bandwidth:

PCU refers to the maximum number of people online at the same time, while PCW refers to the maximum number of concurrent tasks. The bandwidth calculation formula is as follows:

PCU × host’s sending bit rate × number of concurrent hosts (single channel).

For basic real-time interaction scenarios, the limit is reached when PCU or bandwidth reaches its corresponding limit.
For Media Push, the limit depends on the video resolution and is reached When PCW of any resolution reaches its respective limit.

To ensure that your project runs smoothly, check the PCU, PCW, and bandwidth in your project regularly to ensure that all indicators are within the limit. If you need to  extend the limit as your business grows, contact technical support.
