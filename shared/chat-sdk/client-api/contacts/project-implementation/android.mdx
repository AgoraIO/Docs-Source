### Manage the contact list

Use this section to understand how to send a contact invitation, listen for contact events, and accept or decline the contact invitation.

#### Send a contact invitation

Call `addContact` to add the specified user as a contact:

```java
//The parameters are the username of the contact to be added and the reason for adding
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().addContact(toAddUsername, reason);
```

#### Listen for contact events

Use `ContactListener` to add the following callback events. When a user receives a contact invitation, you can accept or decline the invitation. 

```java
 ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().setContactListener(new ContactListener() {

            //The contact request is approved
            @Override
            public void onFriendRequestAccepted(String username) { }

            //contact request is rejected
            @Override
            public void onFriendRequestDeclined(String username) { }

            //Received contact invitation
            @Override
            public void onContactInvited(String username, String reason) { }

            //Call back this method when deleted
            @Override
            public void onContactDeleted(String username) { }

            //Call back this method when a contact is added
            @Override
            public void onContactAdded(String username) { }
        });
```

#### Accept or decline the contact invitation

After receiving `onContactInvited`, call `acceptInvitation` or `declineInvitation` to accept or decline the invitation.

```java
// Accept the contact invitation
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().acceptInvitation(username);

// Decline the contact invitation
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().declineInvitation(username);
```

#### Delete a contact

Call `deleteContact` to delete the specified contact. The deleted user receives the `onContactDeleted` callback.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().deleteContact(username);
```

#### Retrieve the contact list

To get the contact list, you can call `getAllContactsFromServer` to retrieve contacts from the server. After that, you can also call `getContactsFromLocal` to retrieve contacts from the local database.

```java
// Retrieves a list of contacts from the server
List<String> usernames = ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getAllContactsFromServer();

// Retrieves a list of contacts from the local database
List<String> usernames = ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getContactsFromLocal
```

### Manage the blocklist

You can add a specified user to your blocklist. Once you do that, you can still send chat messages to that user, but you cannot receive messages from them.

<div class="note alert">Users can add any other chat user to their blocklist, regardless of whether this other user is a contact or not. A contact added to the blocklist remains in the contact list.</div>

#### Add a user to the blocklist

Call `addUserToBlackList` to add the specified user to the blocklist.

You can add any other users to the blocklist, regardless of whether they are on the contact list or not. Contacts are still displayed on the contact list even if they are added to the blocklist. After adding users to the blocklist,  you can still send messages to them, but will not receive messages from them as they cannot send messages or friend requests to you.

```java
// The effect of true and false is the same. I can send messages to users on the blacklist, but I cannot receive them when they send me messages.
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().addUserToBlackList(username,true);
```


#### Remove a user from the blocklist

To remove the specified user from the blocklist, call `removeUserFromBlackList`.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().removeUserFromBlackList(username);
```

#### Retrieve the blocklist from the server

To get the blocklist, call `getBlackListFromServer` to retrieve a list of blocked users from the server.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getBlackListFromServer();
```

After retrieving the blocklist from the server, you can also call `getBlackListUserNames` to retrieve the blocklist from the local database.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getBlackListUsernames();
```
