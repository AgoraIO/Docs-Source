Streams in Flexible Classroom can be understood as audio and video streams and permission to send audio and video streams. Developers can call APIs to give a user permission to perform a specific operation. A user can have multiple streams. For example, a user can have both permission to send audio and video streams captured by local devices and permission to send the video stream from screen capturing.

Developers can call `addCoHost` to create a stream for a user and gives the user permission to send the audio or video stream. The Flexible Classroom cloud service automatically generates a stream ID. Developers can call `removeCoHost` to permanently destroy a stream and remove permission.
