### Add dependencies

1. Refer to the clone repository to download the VideoLoaderAPI folder. Copy the following folders and files from it to the same level as your `*.xcodeproj` file:
    - `VideoLoaderAPI` folder
    - `VideoLoaderAPI.podspec` document
      ![preload channels best practice](/images/video-sdk/preload-channels-ios-videoloader.png)

2. In the terminal, go to the directory where the `*.xcodeproj` file is located and run the `pod init` command. A **Podfile** text file will be generated in the project folder.

3. Open the **Podfile** file and modify it as follows. Pay attention to the `target` and `path`.

   ```ruby
   source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
   use_frameworks!
   
   platform :ios, '13.0'
   
   # target needs to be changed to the actual Target name in your project.
   target 'VideoLoaderAPI_Example' do
   pod 'VideoLoaderAPI', :path => 'VideoLoaderAPI.podspec'
   
       target 'VideoLoaderAPI_Tests' do
           inherit! :search_paths
       end
   end
   ```

4. In the terminal, go to the directory where the `*.xcodeproj` file is located and execute the `pod install` command to install the dependencies.

After successful installation of the dependency library, a `*.xcworkspace` file will appear.

5. (Optional) If you have integrated an RTC SDK dependency in your project before using the **VideoLoader API**, you can modify the line `VideoLoaderAPI.podspec` to the version of the SDK you are using.

   ```shell
   # 4.1.1.19 is the default version installed in step 4, if you are using a different version, change it to the current one.
   s.dependency 'AgoraRtcEngine_Special_iOS', '4.1.1.19'
   ```
