This article provides the HTTP response status codes for cloud-side transcoding and viewer-side multi-bitrate services.

## Cloud transcoding

When calling the RESTful API for cloud transcoding, the server responds with one of the following HTTP status codes:

* A `2XX` code indicates a successful request.
* A non-`2XX` code indicates a failed request.

For example, a failed request might return:

```json
// 400 Bad Request
{
  "message": "appid is invalid"
}
```

The table below describes the possible response codes, their meanings, and suggested actions:

| Status Code                 | Meaning                                                                              | Suggested Action                                                                                                                                      |

| `200 OK`                    | Request was successful.                                                              | No action required.                                                                                                                                   |
| `201 Created`               | **(Obsolete)** The task is already in progress.                                      | Avoid reusing the same `builderToken`. No troubleshooting needed.                                                                                     |
| `202 Accepted`              | Request received, but processing is not complete.                                    | Use the [`Query`](./cloud-transcoder/operations/get-v1-projects-appId-rtsc-cloud-transcoder-tasks-taskId) API to check task status before continuing. |
| `400 Bad Request`           | Invalid request syntax or parameters. App ID may not have cloud transcoding enabled. | Check the `message` field in the response body for details.                                                                                           |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | Invalid HTTP Basic Authentication credentials.                                       | Verify the `Authorization` field. See [HTTP Basic Authentication](./user-guides/http-auth#Implementing-http-Basic-Authentication).                    |
| `403 Forbidden`             | Cloud transcoding service is not enabled for the App ID.                             | Contact [Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io).                                                                                             |

| `409 Conflict`              | A transcoder task with the same `instanceId` already exists.                         | Delete the existing task before creating a new one.                                                                                                   |

### Troubleshooting tips

* Focus on the status code for troubleshooting, not the `message` content.
* If issues persist, log the values of the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` headers and contact [Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io).
* If a `404` is returned after a successful [`Create`](./cloud-transcoder/operations/post-v1-projects-appId-rtsc-cloud-transcoder-tasks) call and without a subsequent [`Delete`](./cloud-transcoder/operations/delete-v1-projects-appId-rtsc-cloud-transcoder-tasks-taskId), or if the transcoder exceeded the `idleTimeout`, use a backoff algorithm (e.g., retry after 5s, 10s, 15s) and call the `Query` method.
* For `5XX` errors:

  * Use exponential backoff before retrying.
  * Contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if the issue persists.
