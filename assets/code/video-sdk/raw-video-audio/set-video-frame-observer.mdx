    The `AgoraVideoFrameDelegate` gives you access to each local video frame after it is captured, and to each remote video frame before it is played back. To capture and process the video frames, implement the `onCaptureVideoFrame`, `onScreenCaptureVideoFrame`, and `onRenderVideoFrame` callbacks.

    Have a look at [`ModifyVideoFrameDelegate`](https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-ios/blob/main/stream-raw-audio-and-video/ModifyVideoFrameDelegate.swift) for details on how to set up a video frame observer using `AgoraVideoFrameDelegate`.
