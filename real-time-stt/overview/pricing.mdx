This page introduces the billing policy for the <Vpd k="NAME"/> add-on provided by Agora.

Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.

## Overview

Agora calculates the billing of all projects under your Agora account on a monthly basis. Billing begins once you
enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Transcription fee

When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for a channel, it transcribes the audio of its active hosts. When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for specific hosts, it only transcribes the audio of the specified hosts and ignores the others. The <Vpd k="NAME"/> service employs algorithms that remove the periods of silence and improve WER (Word Error Rate) of transcription. The processed audio is transcribed by the <Vpd k="NAME"/> engine and referred to as transcription duration. Agora charges for the transcription duration of all or specified hosts in the channel.

The unit price is as follows:

|Billing item |Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|Transcription duration | Above 0         | 16.99             |

**Example**

After you enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>: 
- Host A speaks for 2 minutes and remains silent for 8 minutes.
- Host B speaks for 3 minutes and remains silent for 7 minutes.
- Host C speaks for 3 minutes and remains silent for 7 minutes.
- All hosts are silent for the first 2 minutes of the call.

In this case, the total transcription minutes are calculated as 2 (Host A) + 3 (Host B) + 3 (Host C) = 8 minutes. The silent periods of each host, including the time spent listening to others, are not counted towards the transcription duration. 

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- WER is a measure of the accuracy of an STT engine - the lower, the better.
- Real-Time STT does not incur additional RTC audio fee.
- Enabling Real-Time STT for channels or hosts that are silent for long periods is not recommended. In the example, during the first 2 minutes, the Real-Time STT worker processes all hosts' audio to remove silent portions. In this case, Agora charges for the first 2 minutes, and the STT engine standby time is billed at $0.99/1,000 minutes with the same discount applied as for RTC audio.

## Language identification fee

<Vpd k="NAME"/> supports dynamic language detection when two or more languages are enabled for a channel or specific hosts. The LID (language identification) duration is the same as the transcription duration.

|Billing item|Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|Language identification duration|Above 0         | 5.00                     |

Examples:
- Let's say there is a channel existing for 10 minutes. There are 3 active hosts - A, B, and C - all in the unmuted state.
- #3: If Spanish and Chinese LID is enabled for this channel at the start, the algorithm will remove 8 minutes of silent audio for host A, 7 minutes for host B and 7 minutes for host C. Therefore, the transcription duration is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 minutes. the LID duration is 8 minutes, too, being the sum of 2 minutes for host A, 3 minutes for host B, and 3 minutes for host C.
- If Spanish and Chinese LID is enabled for host A, then the transcription duration and LID duration are both 2 minutes.

Notes:
- The <Vpd k="NAME"/> transcription duration does not change if you enable more than 1 language.
- If only 1 language is set for a channel or a specified host, the language detection will not start.

## Free-of-charge duration

<Vpd k="NAME"/> provides 300 minutes of free-of-charge duration for integration and testing purposes.
