### Advanced features

You can enable the following advanced <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> features by adjusting the parameters when starting <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

- **Shield a specified app window**: When sharing the screen, if you don't want to expose a specific app window, you can choose to shield it so that the window will not appear in the shared screen.
- **Stroke**: If you need to outline the area being shared, you can stroke a specified app window or screen and customize the width, color, and transparency of the stroke.
- **Pin an app window to the front**: If you share multiple app windows at the same time, the windows may block each other. You can specify an app window and bring it to the front to prevent it from being blocked by other windows.
- **Set the sharing scenario**: The SDK automatically adjusts the Quality of Experience (QOE) policy according to the scenario you choose:
    - When sharing documents, slides, tables, or in remote control applications, set the sharing scene to either **document** or **remote control**. The SDK prioritizes optimizing image quality and minimizing latency, thus enhancing the viewing experience for the recipient of the shared video.
    - When sharing games, movies, or live video broadcasts, set the shared scene to **game** or **video**. The SDK prioritizes smoothness of video at the receiving end.
