During the run time of the Agora Chat SDK, the error codes and error messages might be returned in the following ways:

- The return value when a method call fails.
- The error code reported through the `onError` callback.

For example, when a user registration request fails because the username already exists, the `onError` callback returns the following error code and error message:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.Login(username, passwd,
            callback: new CallBack(
                onSuccess: () =>
                {
                },
                onError: (code, desc) =>
                {
                    // code: 203
                    // desc: USER_ALREADY_EXIST
                }
            )
        );
```
