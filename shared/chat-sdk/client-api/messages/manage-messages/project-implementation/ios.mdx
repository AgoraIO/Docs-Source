### Retrieve conversations

Call `getAllConversations` to retrieve all the conversations on the local device:

```objc
NSArray *conversations = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getAllConversations];
```

### Retrieve messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code sample to retrieve the messages in the specified conversation:

```objc
// Retrieves the conversation ID
AgoraChatConversation *conversation = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getConversation:conversationId type:type createIfNotExist:YES];
// Only one message is loaded during SDK initialization. Call loadMessagesStartFromId to retrieve more messages.
NSArray<AgoraChatMessage *> *messages = [conversation loadMessagesStartFromId:startMsgId count:count searchDirection:MessageSearchDirectionUp];
```

### Retrieve the count of unread messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of unread messages:

```objc
// Retrieves the ID of the specified conversation.
AgoraChatConversation *conversation = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getConversation:conversationId type:type createIfNotExist:YES];
// Retrieves the count of unread messages.
NSInteger unreadCount = conversation.unreadMessagesCount;
```


### Retrieve the count of unread messages in all conversations

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of all unread messages:

```objc
NSArray *conversations = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getAllConversations];
NSInteger unreadCount = 0;
for (AgoraChatConversation *conversation in conversations) {
  unreadCount += conversation.unreadMessagesCount;
}
```


### Mark unread messages as read

Refer to the following code example to mark the specified messages as read:

```objc
AgoraChatConversation *conversation = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getConversation:conversationId type:type createIfNotExist:YES];
// Marks all messages of the specified conversation as read.
[conversation markAllMessagesAsRead:nil];
// Marks the specified message as read.
[conversation markMessageAsReadWithId:messageId error:nil];
```

### Clear chat history

You can call the `deleteAllMessagesAndConversations:completion:` method to clear the current user's chat history, including messages and conversations in individual chats, group chats, and chat rooms. Additionally, you can choose whether to clear the chat history on the server. Note that clearing the chat history on the server means that you will not be able to retrieve conversations and messages from the server, although other users will not be affected.

```swift
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.deleteAllMessagesAndConversations(true, completion: { err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in deleting conversations and messages in them.
    }
})
```

### Delete all messages in a local conversation

You can call `deleteAllMessages` to delete all messages in a local conversation:

```swift
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationId") {
    var err: AgoraChatError? = nil
    conversation.deleteAllMessages(&err)
     if let err = err {
         // Failed to delete messages
     } else {
        // Messages deleted successfully
     }
}
```

### Delete messages in a local conversation by time period

You can call `removeMessagesStart` to delete messages sent and received in a certain period in a local conversation.

```swift
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationId") {
    conversation.removeMessagesStart(startTime, to: endTime)
}
```

### Delete a specific message

You can delete a specific message from a local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```swift
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationId") {
    var err: AgoraChatError? = nil
    conversation.deleteMessage(withId: "messageId", error:&err)
    if let err = err {
        // Failed to delete message
    } else {
        // Message deleted successfully
    }
}
```

### Search for messages using keywords

Call `loadMessagesWithKeyword` to search for messages by keywords, timestamp, and message sender:

```objc
NSArray<AgoraChatMessage *> *messages = [conversation loadMessagesWithKeyword:keyword timestamp:0 count:50 fromUser:nil searchDirection:MessageSearchDirectionDown];
```

### Search for messages in all conversations based on search scope

You can call the `AgoraChatManager#loadMessagesWithKeyword:timestamp:count:fromUser:searchDirection:scope:completion:` method to search in all conversations based on the search scope. This means that, in addition to setting the keywords, message timestamps, number of messages, sender, and search direction, you can also choose to search only in the message content, only in the message extension information, or in both.

```swift
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.loadMessages(withKeyword: "keyword", timestamp: Int64((Date().timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000)), count: 100, fromUser: "", searchDirection: .up, scope: .content, completion: { messages, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Successfully retrieved messages.
    }
})
```

### Search for messages in the current conversation based on search scope

You can call `Conversation#loadMessagesWithKeyword:timestamp:count:fromUser:searchDirection:scope:completion:` method to search for messages in the current conversation based on the search scope. This means that, in addition to setting keywords, message timestamps, number of messages, sender, direction, and other parameters, you can also choose to search only in the message content, only in the message extension information, or in both.

```swift
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationsId") {
    conversation.loadMessages(withKeyword: "keyword", timestamp: 0, count: 50, fromUser: "", searchDirection: .down, scope: .content, completion: { messages, aError in

    })
}
```

### Import messages

Call `importMessages` to import multiple messages to the specified conversation. This applies to scenarios where chat users want to formard messages from another conversation.

```objc
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager importMessages:messages completion:nil];
```

### Insert messages

If you want to insert a message to the current conversation without actually sending the message, construct the message body and call `insertMessage`. This can be used to send notification messages such as "XXX recalls a message", "XXX joins the chat group", and "Typing ...".

```objc
// Inserts a message to the specified conversation.
AgoraChatConversation *conversation = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager getConversation:conversationId type:type createIfNotExist:YES];
[conversation insertMessage:message error:nil];
```
