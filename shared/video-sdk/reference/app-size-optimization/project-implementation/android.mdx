#### Remove plugin when integrating manually
When integrating through the [Direct download](/sdks) link, manually delete the plug-in files that you do not need to use.

#### Remove plugins when integrating using Maven Central

When integrating the Android SDK through Maven Central, you can modify the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file to specify the dynamic libraries you need to integrate and exclude plug-ins you do not need to use. For details on the correspondence between each file in the Android SDK and the fields in `dependencies`, see [implementation fields](#implementation-fields) for details.

Refer to the following samples to include, all, none, or selected plugins.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="all" label="Use all plugins" default>
<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`dependencies {
  implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:4.0.1'
  implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-screen-sharing:4.0.1'
  // ...
}`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="none" label="Don't use any plugins" default>
<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`dependencies {
  implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:4.0.1'
  //...
}`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="selected" label="Use selected plugins" default>
<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`dependencies {
  def agora_sdk_version = "4.3.0"
  // The following code contains $, so you must use double-quotes
  implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:\${agora_sdk_version}"
  implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-ains:\${agora_sdk_version}"
  implementation "io.agora.rtc:audio-beauty:\${agora_sdk_version}"
  //...
}`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>    

### Dynamically load .so files

Generally, you package the required `.so` files when compiling the App, and the SDK loads the `.so` files from the `nativeLibraryPath` of the App. To reduce the size of the app's installation package, <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the `mNativeLibPath` attribute in the `RtcEngineConfig` class to support dynamic loading of the required `.so` files.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
- Since March 6, 2024, using this method to reduce the app size no ​​longer meets the requirements of Google Play. For details, refer to the [Developer Program Policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14693005?hl=zh-Hans) issued by Google. If your app needs to be listed on Google Play, please try other ways to reduce the app size.

- This method is only applicable to manually integrating the Android SDK and does not apply to integration through Maven Central.
</Admonition>

Refer to the following steps to implement this feature:

1. [Download](/sdks) the latest version of the SDK and decompress it.
2. Integrate `agora-rtc-sdk.jar` into your project.
3. Upload the `.so` files for all architectures to your server and make sure that the app can download the `.so` files for the target architecture over the network.
4. When the app runs, it checks for the existence of an `.so` file. If the file is not found, it downloads the `.so` file and saves it to the private directory of the app.
5. When calling `create` to create and initialize an `RtcEngine` instance, set the `mNativeLibPath` config parameter to the app private directory where the `.so` file is located.
6. After calling `create` successfully, the SDK automatically loads the `.so` file from the specified path.
