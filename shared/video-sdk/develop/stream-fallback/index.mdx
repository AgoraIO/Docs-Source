In situations with poor network conditions, the quality of audio and video may decrease. When the network is unstable and it's challenging to maintain both audio and video quality, the <Vg k="VSDK"/> automatically adjusts by switching the video stream to a lower quality or, if necessary, switches to audio-only mode to ensure better audio quality.

## Understand the tech

In <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/>, dual-stream mode involves transmitting two video streams simultaneously from the sender's end. These streams differ in resolution, with one optimized for devices with larger screens or better network conditions, while the other is tailored for devices with smaller screens or poorer network conditions.

When the stream fallback option is enabled, the system intelligently switches between the high-quality and low-quality video streams based on prevailing network conditions. This dynamic adjustment ensures optimal performance during <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> sessions, adapting to varying network bandwidths and device capabilities in real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.
