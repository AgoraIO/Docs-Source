During a call, <Vg k="VSDK"/> triggers callbacks related to the video calling quality. These callbacks enable you to monitor your users' experience, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their overall experience

## Understand the tech

After a user joins a channel, <Vg k="VSDK"/> triggers a series of callbacks every 2 seconds, reporting information such as uplink and downlink network quality, real-time interaction statistics, and statistics of local and remote audio and video streams.

When there is a change in the audio or video state of a user, <Vg k="VSDK"/> triggers a callback to report the latest state and the reason for the change. The following figure shows the audio transmission process between app clients:

</details>

To monitor the call quality, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides the following call quality notifications:

**Network quality**

The network quality callback provides insight into the uplink and downlink last mile network quality for each participant in the channel. Last mile refers to the network from your device to Agora server. The [Network quality scores](#network-quality-score) are calculated based on factors such as sending or receiving bitrate, network packet loss rate, round-trip delay, and network jitter.

**Statistics**

The statistics callback, triggered every 2 seconds, reports key metrics such as call duration, the number of participants, system CPU usage, and app CPU usage.

**Audio quality**

Callbacks related to audio quality cover both local and remote audio streams. You monitor statistics and status changes, to gain insights into the quality of audio streams and any related reasons for status changes.

**Video quality**

Video quality callbacks provide information on both local and remote video streams. You receive statistics and status change notifications, that enable you to understand the quality of video streams and any related reasons for status changes.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.
