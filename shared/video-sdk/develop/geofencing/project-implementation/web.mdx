You call the `AgoraRTC.setArea` method to specify the access area. By default, the SDK selects the nearest Agora server region to connect to. After you set the access area, the SDK only connects to Agora servers in the specified area.

Currently, only specifying a single access area is supported. You can set the area to:

* `ASIA`  : Asia except Mainland China
* `CHINA` : Mainland China
* `EUROPE`: Europe
* `GLOBAL`: Global (Default)
* `INDIA` : India
* `JAPAN` : Japan
* `NORTH_AMERICA`: North America

Refer to the following sample code:

```javascript
AgoraRTC.setArea("ASIA");
```
