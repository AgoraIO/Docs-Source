In this section, we prepare the development environment necessary to integrate Chat into your app.

### Create an iOS project

In Xcode, follow the steps to create an iOS app project. 

- Open Xcode and click **Create a new Xcode project**.

- Select **iOS** for the platform type and **App** for the project type and click **Next**.

- Set the following project parameters:

  - **Product Name**: Enter **AgoraChatExample**.

  - **Organization Identifier**: Enter **agorachat**.

  - **User Interface**: Choose **Storyboard**.

  - **Language**: Choose **Objective-C**.

  - **Team**: If you have added a team, choose it from the pop-up menu. If not, you can see the **Add account** button. Click it, enter your Apple ID, and click **Next** to add your team.

  - Select the project storage path and click **Create**.

### Integrate the Chat SDK

Use CocoaPods to integrate the Chat SDK into your project.

1. Install CocoaPods if you have not. For details, see [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In the Terminal, navigate to the project root directory and run the `pod init` command to create a text file `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile` file and add the Chat SDK. Remember to replace `AgoraChatExample` with the target name of your project.

   ```
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   
   # Import CocoaPods sources
   source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
   
   target 'AgoraChatExample' do
       pod 'AgoraChat'
       pod 'Masonry'
   end
   ```

4. In the project root directory, run the following command to integrate the SDK. When the SDK is installed successfully, you can see `Pod installation complete!` in the Terminal and an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder. 

   ```
   pod install
   ```

5. Open the `xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

### Add permissions

Open the `info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

1. Add `App Transport Security Settings`.

2. Under `App Transport Security Settings`, add `Allow Arbitrary Loads` and set it as `YES` to enable network permissions.
