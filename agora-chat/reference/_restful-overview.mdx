Chat provides RESTful APIs through the REST platform. You can send HTTP requests to the Agora server through your business server to realize real-time communication on the server side.

## REST Platform Architecture

The Chat REST platform provides a multi-tenant architecture to manage resources in the form of a Collection. To see the collection, check <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CHAT_POSTMAN_APIS}}/9265552/2s7ZTAtiWP#intro">Agora Chat RESTful API Overview</Link>.
