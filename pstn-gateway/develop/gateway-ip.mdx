 IP addresses for configuring firewalls and SIP routing with Agora's PSTN and SIP Gateway.
---

When integrating with <Vpd k="NAME" />, configure your network infrastructure, firewalls, or SIP providers with specific IP addresses. This reference provides the gateway IP addresses for inbound and outbound calls.

## Outbound IPs
When using outbound PSTN calls, Agora's gateway originates calls from the following IP addresses. Add these to any firewall allow-lists or access control lists that restrict outbound calling by IP.

- `3.9.67.24`
- `52.3.185.227`
- `52.9.29.181`
- `34.233.232.16`

## Inbound IPs

For inbound SIP configuration (such as Twilio SIP trunks), point calls to these IP addresses. Configure one as primary and the other as backup/failover.

- `52.3.185.227`
- `52.9.29.181`
