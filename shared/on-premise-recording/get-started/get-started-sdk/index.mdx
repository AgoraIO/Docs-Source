This article describes how to use the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> to record real-time audio and video.

## Understand the tech

Recording audio and video in a channel using the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> works by adding a special user to the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel. This special user captures the audio and video from the channel, transcodes it, and stores it on your Linux server.

<Admonition type="info">
Integrate the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> into your Linux server, not your client app. To record audio and video without deploying a Linux server, use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> [<Vg k="CREC" />](/cloud-recording/overview/product-overview).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, complete the following steps and ensure your environment meets the required specifications:

* [Create an Agora project](/on-premise-recording/get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-temporary-token/) in the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and obtain an App ID and a temporary token.
* Implement a <Vg k="VSDK" /> project that includes basic audio and video interaction.

**Server hardware requirements:**

* **CPU**: 8 cores, 1.8 GHz
* **Memory**: At least 4 GB (recommended)

**Server software requirements:**

* **Operating system**: Ubuntu 18.04 or later, or CentOS 7.0 or later  
* **CPU architecture**: arm64 or x86-64  
* **glibc**: version 2.18 or later  
* **gcc**: version 4.8 or later

**Network requirements:**

* The server must be connected to the public internet and have a public IP address.
* The server must allow access to the following domains:
  * `*.agora.io`
  * `*.agoralab.co`
