<PlatformWrapper platform="flutter">

To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, set the `areaCode` property of `RtcEngineContext` when you `initialize` the <Vg k="ENGINE"/>. To do this, in `setupVideoSDKEngine` **replace** the `agoraEngine.initialize` method call with the following:

```dart
// Your app will only connect to Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
await agoraEngine.initialize(RtcEngineContext(
    areaCode: AreaCode.areaCodeNa.value(),
    appId: appId
));
```

If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> in the the specified region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error instead of connecting to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region. 

If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

* Whitelist the relevant domains
* Allow all IP addresses
* Open the firewall ports defined in the [firewall requirements](../reference/firewall)
