## Call APIs to change connection states

You can use the state and cause for the state change returned by the `ConnectionStateChanged` callback to actively call the API to change the connection state in the following situations.

### Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />

When you call `login` to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />, the connection state changes from `DISCONNECTED` to `CONNECTING`, and the cause for the state change is `LOGIN`. When the state is `CONNECTING`, the connection state automatically changes to one of the following states:

-   `DISCONNECTED`: The login fails or times out (the user fails to log in within 12 seconds).

-   `CONNECTED`: The login succeeds.

When the connection state turns to `DISCONNECTED`, you need to call `login` again to log in.

### Disconnected from <Vg k="SIG" /> due to network problems

When the connection state is `CONNECTED`, if the connection with the Agora RTM system is interrupted and cannot recover in four seconds due to network reasons, the connection state changes to `RECONNECTING`, and the cause for the state change is `INTERRUPTED`. When in the `RECONNECTING` state, the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> continues to automatically reconnect to <Vg k="SIG" /> until the login is successful, so you do not need to perform any login operations. After successful reconnection, the connection state changes to `CONNECTED`.

The SDK resends messages that occurred during the disconnection period according to the following guidelines:

-   Sender
    During the reconnection period, the SDK continues to send all channel and peer-to-peer messages until the message request times out.

-   Receiver
    After the reconnection succeeds, <Vg k="SIG" /> resends all of the peer-to-peer messages sent during the disconnection period but only the channel messages from the 30-second period immediately before reconnection (up to a maximum of 32 messages) to the receiver.

If the reconnection keeps failing, the connection state remains at `RECONNECTING`. You can call `logout` to log out of the system first, and then call the `login` method to reconnect at an appropriate time.

<Vg k="SIG" /> responds differently per the length of time between the interruption of the connection and the successful reconnection:

-   If the user successfully logs in again within 30 seconds of the interruption, the connection state changes to the CONNECTED. The userâ€™s online state remains unchanged.

-   If the user is still offline 30 seconds after the interruption, <Vg k="SIG" /> removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `MemberLeft` callback. If the user successfully logs in later, the connection state changes to the `CONNECTED`. The SDK automatically adds the user to the previous channel, and users in the same channel receive the `MemberJoined` callback. Because <Vg k="SIG" /> has removed the user from the online list, the SDK will also automatically synchronize user attributes to <Vg k="SIG" />.

In the `RECONNECTING` state, the SDK keeps reconnecting to the Agora RTM system. If the token expires, the SDK returns the `TokenExpired` callback, which does not affect the connection state.

### Kicked out of <Vg k="SIG" />

If the same user ID logs in to <Vg k="SIG" /> from another client instance, the user who is currently connected in the client instance gets kicked out by the RTM system, and the connection state changes to `ABORTED`. You can call `logout` to log out of the system first, and then call the `login` method to reconnect in an appropriate time.

### Log out of the RTM system

If you call `logout` to log out of the RTM system, the connection state changes to `DISCONNECTED`. The RTM system removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `MemberLeft` callback.

## Sample code

Refer to the following sample code to monitor the connection state:
    ```javascript
    // Monitors the connection state
    rtm.on('ConnectionStateChanged', (newState, reason) => {
        console.log('reason', reason)
            })
    ```
