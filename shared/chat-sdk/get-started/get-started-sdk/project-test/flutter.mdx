Fill in the username in the `Enter username` box and password in the `Enter password` box, and click **SIGN UP** to register an account. In this example, register two accounts, `flutter01` and `flutter02`, to enable sending and receiving messages.

2. Log in  
After signing up the accounts, fill in the username in the `Enter username` box and password in the `Enter password` box, and click **SIGN IN** to log in to the app. In this example, log in as `flutter01`.

3. Send a message  
Fill in the username of the receiver (`flutter02`) in the `Enter recipient's user name` box, type in the message ("hello") to send in the `Enter message` box, and click **SEND TEXT** to send the message.

4. Log out   
Click **SIGN OUT** to log out of the app.

5. Receive the message  
After signing out as `flutter01`, log in as `flutter02`, and receive the message "hello" sent in step 3.
