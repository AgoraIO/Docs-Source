### Connection states

The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> may have the following connection states before joining, during a session, and after leaving a channel:

|Connection state |Description	|
|:-----------------|:-----------|
|**Disconnected** |Initial connection state. Usually occurs: <ul><li>Before calling `joinChannel`.</li><li>After calling `leaveChannel`.</li></ul> |
|**Connecting** |The instantaneous state after calling `joinChannel`. |
|**Connected** |Occurs after the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has successfully joined the channel. The SDK also triggers the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback to report that the local client has joined the channel. At this point the user can publish or subscribe to the audio and video in the channel. |
|**Reconnecting** |Occurs when the connection is interrupted. The SDK automatically tries to reconnect after an interruption. <ul><li>If the rejoin channel succeeds, the SDK triggers the `onRejoinChannelSuccess` callback.</li><li>If the channel is not rejoined within 10 seconds, the SDK triggers `onConnectionStateChanged(Reconnecting, Lost)`, while still trying to rejoin the channel.</li></ul> |
|**Failed** |Connection failed. Occurs when the SDK is unable to join a channel for 20 minutes and the SDK stops attempting to reconnect to the channel. At this time it is necessary to call `leaveChannel` to leave the current channel, and then call `joinChannel` to join the channel again. |

### State description and troubleshooting

The `reason` parameter in `onConnectionStateChanged` describes the reason for the connection state change.

The following table maps the relationships between different connection states and the causes of state change, as well as how to handle the situation when network outages occur:

|Connection state |Description and troubleshooting guide |
|:-----------------|:-----------|
|**Disconnected** |<ul><li>`LEAVE_CHANNEL` (5): The user leaves the channel.</li><li>`INVALID_TOKEN` (8): Use a valid token to join the channel.</li></ul> |
|**Connecting** |`CONNECTING` (0): The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is trying to join the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel. |
|**Connected** |`JOIN_SUCCESS` (1): The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has successfully joined the channel. |
|**Reconnecting** |<ul><li>`INTERRUPTED` (2): When the network connection is interrupted, the SDK automatically reconnects to the channel and the connection state continues to change.</li><li>`LOST` (16): Wait for the SDK to successfully reconnect to the server.</li><li>`SETTING_PROXY_SERVER` (11): Wait for the SDK to successfully reconnect to the server.</li><li>`CLIENT_IP_ADDRESS_CHANGED` (13): Wait for the SDK to successfully reconnect to the server.</li><li>`KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` (14): Wait for the SDK to successfully reconnect to the server.</li><li>`RENEW_TOKEN` (12): The token has been updated and the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is trying to rejoin the channel.</li></ul> |
|**Failed** |<ul><li>`BANNED_BY_SERVER` (3): The user is banned by the server.</li><li>`JOIN_FAILED` (4): The SDK stopped trying to reconnect after continued failed attempts to join the channel for 20 minutes. Call `leaveChannel` to leave the current channel and then call `joinChannel` to rejoin the channel.</li><li>`INVALID_APP_ID` (6): Use a valid app ID to join the channel.</li><li>`INVALID_CHANNEL_NAME` (7): Use a valid channel name to join the channel.</li><li>`TOKEN_EXPIRED` (9): Obtain a new token from the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> server, and then call `joinChannel` to join the channel.</li><li>`REJECTED_BY_SERVER` (10): Occurs under the following circumstances:<ul><li>The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> calls `joinChannel` after the local user has joined the channel.</li><li>The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> called `startEchoTest`, but did not call `stopEchoTest` to end the echo test.</li></ul></li></ul> |
