The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK is a recording component developed by Agora for audio and video calls and live broadcasts. Through simple operation methods, it helps developers quickly and flexibly deploy recording services to record audio and video calls or live broadcasts and generate recording files in MP4 format.

With the recording function, you can save the content of voice calls, video calls, and live broadcasts, and make it available for later viewing. For example, learners can review course recordings at their convenience or catch up on lessons they missed after attending live online classes.

The SDK works with <Vg k="VSDK" /> and is compatible with the Agora RTC Native and framework SDKs (version 1.7.0 or higher) and the Agora RTC Web SDK (version 1.12.0 or higher).

<Admonition type="info">
The Agora On-Premise Recording SDK requires deployment on Linux servers with self-managed maintenance. If you prefer not to deploy Linux servers and want to implement recording through RESTful APIs, use [Agora Cloud Recording](/cloud-recording/overview/product-overview).
