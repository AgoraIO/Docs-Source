This page explains how to integrate <Vg k="RTEE_MK"/> extension into your project to utilize the virtual human, Animoji, lighting effects, and 360 background functions.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must have:

- Integrated the v4.2.x or v4.3.x of the Video SDK and implemented basic real-time audio and video functions in your app. See [SDK quickstart](/realtime-communication/get-started/get-started-sdk).
  <PlatformWrapper platform="android">
    <Admonition type="info" info="Note"><ul><li>When integrating through Maven Central, specify `io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:x.y.z` and replace `x.y.z` with the specific SDK version number.</li><li>The MetaKit extension uses the Face Capture extension ( `libagora_face_capture_extension.so`) and the Virtual Background extension (`libagora_segmentation_extension.so`). You can delete unnecessary extensions as needed to reduce the size of the app.</li></ul></Admonition>
    </PlatformWrapper>
  <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
    <Admonition type="info" info="Note"><ul><li>When integrating through CocoaPods, specify pod `AgoraRtcEngine_Special_iOS` and replace `x.y.z` with the specific SDK version number.</li><li>The MetaKit extension uses the Face Capture extension ( `AgoraFaceCaptureExtension.xcframework`) and the Virtual Background extension (`AgoraVideoSegmentationExtension.xcframework`). You can delete unnecessary extensions as needed to reduce the size of the app.</li></ul></Admonition>
    </PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="android">
