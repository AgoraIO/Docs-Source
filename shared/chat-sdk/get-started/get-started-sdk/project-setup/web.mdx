To create the environment necessary to add peer-to-peer messaging into your app, do the following:

1. Use VITE to create a new project. If VITE is not installed, run `npm i vite -g` to install it. Then, run `npm create vite@latest agora_quickstart`. In this example, we choose "React + JavaScript" to create the project.

1. Integrate Agora Chat SDK into your project through `npm i agora-chat`.
