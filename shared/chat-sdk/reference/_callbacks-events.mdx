Chat supports HTTP callbacks (webhooks).
You can listen for event callbacks and add app logics accordingly. Once a registered callback is triggered by a specified type of event, the Chat server sends an HTTP POST request to your app server, notifying you that the event occurs. The request body is a JSON string encoded in UTF-8 characters.

This page introduces the events and callbacks in Chat.

## User login and logout events

When a user logs in to or logs out of the Chat app, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server.

### Log in to the app

### Decline a contact invitation

When a user declines the contact invitation from another user, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server. The sample code of the `payload` field is as follows:

```json
"payload":
{
    // The version of the contact list.
    "roster_ver":"XXXXEC24XXXX32B2EB1B654AA446930DB9BAFE59",
    // "decline" indicates that the current operation is to decline the contact invitation.
    "operation":"decline"
}
```

When another user declines the contact invitation from a user, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server. The sample code of the `payload` field is as follows:

```json
"payload": { 
    // The version of the contact list.
    "roster_ver": "1BD5718E9C9D3F0C572A5157CFC711D4F6FA490F", 
    // "remote_decline" indicates that the current operation is to decline the contact invitation.
    "operation": "remote_decline" 
}
```

### Add a contact to the block list

When a user adds a contact to the block list, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server. The sample code of the `payload` field is as follows:

```json
"payload":
{
    // "ban" indicates that the current operation is to add a contact to the block list.
    "operation":"ban",
    "status":
    {
        "error_code":"ok"
    }
}
```

### Remove a contact from the block list

When a user removes a contact from the block list, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server. The sample code of the `payload` field is as follows:

```json
"payload":
{
    // "allow" indicates that the current operation is to remove a contact from the block list.
    "operation":"allow",
    "status":
    {
        "error_code":"ok"
    }
}
```

## Receipt events

When a user sends an receipt, the Chat server sends a callback to your app server. The sample code is as follows:

```json
{
    "chat_type": "read_ack",
    "callId": "XXXX#XXXX968665325555943556",
    "security": "bd63XXXX8f72XXXX6d33e09a43aa4239",

    },
    "host": "msync@ebs-ali-beijing-msync45",
    "appkey": "XXXX#XXXX",
    "from": "1111",
    "to": "2222",
    "eventType": "chat",
    "msg_id": "9686XXXX5555943556",
