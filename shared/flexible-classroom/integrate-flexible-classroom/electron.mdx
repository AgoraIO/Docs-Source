## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> into your Electron project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, download and use the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13) on GitHub to integrate <Vg k="FC"/>.

### Use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>

To integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through CDN if you're satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, follow this integration method. You must have an existing Electron project using an Electron version higher than 12.0.0 to use this method.

1. Add the following code to the Electron entry file:

    ```javascript
    const electron = require('electron');
    app.allowRendererProcessReuse = false;
    ```

2. When creating a `BrowserWindow` object, pass in the following parameters:

    ```javascript
    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
      ...
      webPreferences: {
        ...
        autoplayPolicy: "no-user-gesture-required",
        nodeIntegration: true,
        contextIsolation: false,
        webSecurity: false,
        webviewTag: true,
        enableRemoteModule: true,
        nativeWindowOpen: true,
        backgroundThrottling: false
      }
    });
    ```

3. Add the following dependencies and configurations to `package.json`:

    ```json
    "agora_electron": {
      "electron_version": "12.0.0",
      "prebuilt": true
    },
    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "agora-electron-sdk": "3.6.1-rc.9-build.817"
      "adm-zip": "0.4.14",
    }
    ```

4. Import the Agora Classroom SDK in the HTML file and launch a classroom.

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">Flexible Classroom's dependency `agora-electron-sdk` contains the native Node.js module. It is not recommended to use webpack and other construction tools for secondary compilation; otherwise, there may be an error that the Node.js module cannot be found. It is recommended to set these two libraries as external dependencies in the project configuration. For example: `externals: {'agora-electron-sdk': 'commonjs2 agora-electron-sdk'}`.    </Admonition>

                    popupQuiz: AgoraSelector,

                listener: (evt, args) => {
                },
            });
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what is a <Vg k="MESS" /> token, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purpose, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server. The generated token passed in `userId` must be consistent with the `userUuid` parameters passed in the `launch` method; otherwise, the generated token will be invalid.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:

<div class="alert info">Make sure you have <a href="../get-started/#set-up-the-development-environment">set up the development environment</a>.</div>

1. To clone the Flexible-Classroom-Desktop repository and check out the latest release branch, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop.git
   cd flexible-classroom-desktop
   ```

1. Switch to the latest branch.

    For example, if you want to switch to the branch of v2.9.20, just run the following command:

    ```bash
    git checkout release/2.9.20
    ```

   Agora recommends switching the branch to the latest release.


1. Modify the code according to your needs. See [Classroom and Proctor SDK UI customization guide](../develop/customize-ui).
