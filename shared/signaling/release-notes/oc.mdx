## v1.4.6
v1.4.6 was released on June 21, 2021. This release supports iOS 15.

## v1.4.5

v1.4.5 was released on April 30, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

As of v1.4.4, the SDK has been upgraded from a static library to a dynamic library, and the format of all dynamic libraries changes from framework to XCFramework.
If you are using a build tool that does not support the dynamic library in XCFramework format, Agora provides the following scripts to help you integrate:

- Use the [change_to_all_arch.sh](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1621391958917) script to convert the XCFramework to the universal framework.
- If you need to publish an iOS/macOS app on the App Store, use the [remove_simulator_arch.sh](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1621392005121)  script to remove the simulator before packaging the app.

#### Improvements

Fixed some issues that might cause crashes to improve stability.

#### Fixed issues

The iOS app integrated with the SDK v1.4.4 cannot be published on the App Store due to review issues.

## v1.4.4

v1.4.4 was released on April 20, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

This release replaces the static library with a dynamic library for the following reasons:

- Improving overall security.
- Avoiding compatibility issues with other third-party libraries.
- Making it easier to upload the app to the App Store.

To upgrade the <Vg k="MESS" /> Native SDK, you must re-integrate the dynamic library, **AgoraRtmKit.xcframework.** And there is no need to integrate dependent libraries.

The format of all dynamic libraries changes from Framework to XCFramework. A dynamic library in XCFramework format supports running a project on both physical devices and simulators.

#### Improvements

Improved the success rate of logins and message delivery for the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> in poor network conditions.

#### Issues Fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- A memory leak issue with the SDK.
- Some issues that may cause the system to crash.

## v1.4.3

v1.4.3 was released on February 10, 2021.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Naming conflict between the values in the `AgoraAreaCode` constant of the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> and the `AgoraRtmAreaCode` constant of the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> when using Swift. As of v1.4.3, Agora Objective-C SDK for iOS/macOS provides `AgoraRtmKit_swift.h`, which updates the constant values of `AgoraRtmAreaCode`, to avoid this naming conflict.
- Crash issues caused by OpenSSL upgrade in Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> v1.4.2.
- Crash issues caused by occasional multi-thread access conflict.
- High timeout rate for <Vg k="MESS" /> login operations.

## v1.4.2

v1.4.2 was released on November 23, 2020.

#### Improvements

- Improved performance of login and messaging operations.
- Added the `AGORA_SDK_BOTH_RTM_AND_RTC` macro for the `AgoraRtmAreaCode` enum type. You can use the macro to resolve naming conflicts when using <Vg k="VSDK" /> and <Vg k="MESS" /> together.

## v1.4.1

v1.4.1 was released on September 30, 2020.

#### Improvements

Improved the log file.

#### Bug fixes

Fixed the pop up issue in iOS 14.

## v1.4.0

v1.4.0 was released on September 1, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

- You need to add new ports to the firewall whitelist. See [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).
    - New TCP ports: 8443, 9136, 9137, 9141. New UDP port: 8443. Reason: Support real-time transport encryption.
    - New UDP ports: 8130, 9120, 9121. Reason: Support UDP path to improve the SDK's performance in sub-optimal network conditions.
    - New UDP port: 9700. Reason: Support data reporting.
- In `setLogFileSize`, the default log file size increases from 512 KB to 10 MB. The maximum log file size increases from 10 MB to 1 GB.
- Before destroying an `AgoraRtmKit` instance, you must call  `destroyChannelWithId` to destroy all existing `AgoraRtmChannel` instances. Otherwise, the SDK may crash.

#### New features

- Geofencing. You can call `setRtmServiceContext` to set the region of the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> can only connect to Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> servers within the specified region.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

#### Improvements

- Improved the success rate of login and message delivery of the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> in poor network conditions.
- Optimized the reconnection mechanism.

#### API changes

## v1.3.0

v1.3.0 was released on May 8, 2020.

**Compatibility changes**

- You need to add a new TCP port, 9140, to the firewall whitelist. The port is for sending and receiving image or file messages. See [Firewall Requirements](../reference/firewall).
- The Agora server blocks any file message or image message that you send to <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> 1.2.2 or earlier, or to the Signaling SDK.

**New features**

#### 1. Send and receive file messages

v1.3.0 supports downloading non-empty files that are smaller than 30 MB. You can cancel an ongoing upload or download process at any time. Each file you upload to the Agora server corresponds to a media ID. The file stays on the Agora server for seven days. You can use the media ID to download the file as long as it is is still on the Agora server.

<div class="alert note">You can only download files using the download methods provided by the SDK.</div>

v1.3.0 adds the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface for saving and transferring a media ID. The `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface inherits from the `AgoraRtmMessage` interface, so you can use existing peer-to-peer or channel messaging methods to transfer the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance. You can use the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface to complete the following tasks:

- Set the filename and thumbnail of the uploaded file.
- Get the size of the uploaded file.

<div class="alert note">The total size of the message content, the filename, and the thumbnail must not exceed 32 KB.</div>

#### 2. Send and receive image messages

v1.3.0 supports downloading non-empty image files that are smaller than 30 MB. You can cancel an ongoing upload or download process at any time. Each image file you upload to the Agora server corresponds to a media ID. The image file stays on the Agora server for seven days. You can use media ID to download the image file as long as the image file is still on the Agora server.

<div class="alert note">You can only download images using the download methods provided by the SDK.</div>

v1.3.0 adds the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface for saving and transferring a media ID. The `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface inherits from the `AgoraRtmMessage` interface, so you can use existing peer-to-peer or channel messaging methods to transfer the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance. You can use the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface to complete the following tasks:

- Set the filename and thumbnail of the uploaded image.
- Get the size of the uploaded image.
- Get the SDK-calculated width and height of images in JPEG, JPG, BMP, or PNG format.
- Set the width or height of images. The width or height you set overwrite the width or height that the SDK calculates.

<div class="alert note">The total size of the message content, the filename, and the thumbnail must not exceed 32 KB.</div>

#### 3. Report the progress of upload or download

SDK returns the progress of an upload or download by callback every second during a task in progress. If the upload or download task pauses, the SDK ceases to return any further callback until the task continues.

**Bug fixes**

- Login failure caused by the SDK's incorrect identification of user's network type.
- Other problems that may cause the system to crash.

**API changes**

## v1.2.2

v1.2.2 was released on December 13, 2019.



**Issues Fixed**

Occasionally fails to receive any callback after a channel attribute operation.

## v1.2.1

v1.2.1 was released on November 29, 2019.

**New Feature**

*Compatible with the endCall method of the Agora Signaling SDK*

If you use the `sendMessageToPeer` method to send a <i>text</i> message in the format of AgoraRTMLegacyEndcallCompatibleMessagePrefix_\<channelId\>_\<your additional information\>, then this method is compatible with the endCall method of the legacy Agora Signaling SDK. Replace \<channelId\> with the channel ID from which you want to leave (end call), and replace \<your additional information\> with any additional information. Note that you must not put any "_" (underscore) in your additional information but you can set \<your additional information\> as empty "".

**Issues Fixed**


- The SDK fails to reconnect to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system if the user disables VPN.
- If a channel member reconnects to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> server after being interrupted, chances are the rest members of the channel can receive `MemberJoined` twice.

## v1.2.0

v1.2.0 was released on November 6, 2019.

**Compatibility Changes**

Deprecated the `isOnline` property of the `AgoraRtmPeerOnlineStatus`. Use `state` instead.


**New Features**

#### Subscribe to the online status of the specified user(s)

When the method call succeeds, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report the online status of peers, to whom you subscribe.
When the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed.
If the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes when the SDK is reconnecting to the server, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed when successfully reconnecting to the server.

#### Unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s)

Allows you to unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s).

#### Get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed

Allows you to get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed.

#### Create a raw message

Creates and initializes a raw message to be sent.

 If you set a text description, ensure that the size of the raw message and the description combined does not exceed 32 KB.

## v1.1.0

v1.1.0 is released on September 18, 2019. It adds the following features:

- [Gets the member count of specified channel(s).](#getcount)
- [Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel](#oncount)
- [Channel attribute operations](#channelattributes)



**Compatibility Changes**

1. Deprecates the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/sendMessage:toPeer:completion:">sendMessage:toPeer:completion:</Link> method, and uses <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/sendMessage:toPeer:sendMessageOptions:completion:">sendMessage:toPeer:sendMessageOptions:completion:</Link> instead
2. The <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmMessage.html#//api/name/serverReceivedTs">serverReceivedTs</Link> property of the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmMessage.html">AgoraRtmMessage</Link> instance supports both peer-to-peer and channel messages.
3. Timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message is 10 seconds from this release, compared to 5 seconds in previous versions. See <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Constants/AgoraRtmSendPeerMessageErrorCode.html">AgoraRtmSendPeerMessageErrorTimeout</Link>
4. Puts a limit on the frequency of <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmChannel.html#//api/name/joinWithCompletion:">joinWithCompletion</Link> the same channel:  <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Constants/AgoraRtmJoinChannelErrorCode.html">Two times every five seconds</Link>.

**New Features**

<a name="getcount"></a>
#### 1. Gets the member count of specified channel(s).

You can now get the member count of specified channel(s) without the need to join, by calling the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/getChannelMemberCount:completion:">getChannelMemberCount</Link> method. You can get the member counts of a maximum of 32 channels in one method call.

<a name="oncount"></a>
#### 2. Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel

If you are already in a channel, you do not have to call the `getChannelMemberCount` method to get the member count of the current channel. We also do not recommend using `onMemberJoined` and `onMemberLeft` to keep track of the member counts. As of this release, the SDK returns to the channel members <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Protocols/AgoraRtmChannelDelegate.html#//api/name/channel:memberCount:">memberCount</Link> the latest channel member count when the number of channel members changes. Note that:

- When the number of channel members ≤ 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once per second.
- When the number of channel members exceeds 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once every three seconds.

> Please treat this callback and the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Blocks/AgoraRtmGetMembersBlock.html">AgoraRtmGetMembersBlock</Link> callback separately:
> - The former is an automatic callback. It returns the current numer of channel members;
> - The latter is triggered by the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmChannel.html#//api/name/getMembersWithCompletion:">getMembersWithCompletion</Link> method. It returns a member list of the current channel. If the number of channel members exceeds 512, the SDK only returns a list of 512 randomly-selected channel members.

<a name="channelattributes"></a>
#### 3. Channel attribute operations

Supports setting or getting the attribute(s) of a specified channel. You can use this feature to create group anouncement.

Each channel attribute comes as a key-value pair. See <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmChannelAttribute.html">AgoraRtmChannelAttribute</Link>. Where:

- The key of each channel attribute must be visible characters and not exceed 8 KB.
- Each channel attribute must not exceed 8 KB in length.
- The overall size of the attributes of a channel must not exceed 32 KB.
- The number of attributes of a channel must not exceed 32.

Specific features:

- Sets the attributes of a specified channel with new ones.
- Adds or updates the attribute(s) of a specified channel.
- Deletes the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.
- Clears all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.

When updating attributes of a channel, you can use the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmChannelAttributeOptions.html#//api/name/enableNotificationToChannelMembers">enableNotificationToChannelMembers</Link> flag to decide whether or not to notify all members of the channel about this attribute change.

> The SDK caches the channel attributes. If multiple users have the privilege to update the channel attributes, then we recommend calling the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/getChannelAllAttributes:completion:">getChannelAllAttributes</Link> to update the cache before updating the channel attributes.

**Improvements**

#### Resends peer-to-peer messages

This release improves the resending mechanism of peer-to-peer messages, and extends the timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message from five to 10 seconds, greatly improving the success rate of peer-to-peer message sending under weak network conditions.

#### Caches channel messages

The Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system will resend a maximum of 32 channel messages of up to 30 seconds to channel members, when they manage to reconnect to the system from poor network conditions. This greatly improves the overall arrival rate of channel messages under weak network conditions.

## v1.0.1

v1.0.1 is released on August 1st, 2019.

#### Issues Fixed

- When the connection to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system is interrupted, the SDK does not return the `connectionStateChanged` callback.
- Occasional crashes on iOS.

## v1.0.0

v1.0.0 is released on July 24th, 2019.

#### New Features

#### Interconnects with the legacy Agora Signaling SDK

v1.0.0 implements the `channelId` property in the `AgoraRtmLocalInvitation` class.

> - To intercommunicate with the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, you MUST set the channel ID. However, even if the callee successfully accepts the call invitation, the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> does not join the channel of the specified channel ID.
> - If your App does not involve the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, we recommend using the `content` property of the `AgoraRtmLocalInvitation` class or the `response` property of the `AgoraRtmRemoteInvitation` class to set customized contents.

#### Specifies the default path to the SDK log file

Supports changing the default path to the SDK log file using the `setLogFile` method. To avoid creating an incomplete log file, we recommend calling this method once you have created and initialized an `AgoraRtmKit` instance.



#### Sets the output log level of the SDK

Supports setting the output log level of the SDK using the `setLogFilter` method.  The log level follows the sequence of OFF, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, and INFO. Choose a level to see the logs preceding that level. If, for example, you set the log level to WARNING, you see the logs within levels CRITICAL, ERROR, and WARNING. See also <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Constants/AgoraRtmLogFilter.html">AgoraRtmLogFilter</Link>.

> You can call this method once you have created and initializd an `AgoraRtmKit` instance. You do not have to call this method after calling the `loginByToken` method.

#### Sets the log file size in KB

Supports setting the log file size using the `setLogFileSize` method. The log file has a default size of 512 KB. File size settings of less than 512 KB or greater than 10 MB will not take effect.


> You can call this method once you have created and initializd an `AgoraRtmKit` instance. You do not have to call this method after calling the `loginByToken` method.

#### Improvements

Adds error codes based on the following scenarios:

- The Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> service is not initialized.
- The method call frequency exceeds the limit.
- The user does not call the `loginByToken` method or the method call of `loginByToken` does not succeed before calling any of the <Vg k="MESS" /> core APIs.

#### Issues Fixed

- Occasional crashes on iOS.
- One can log in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system with a static App ID and an <Vg k="MESS" /> token, which is generated from a dynamic App ID.

## v0.9.3

v0.9.3 is released on June 7th, 2019.

#### New Features

#### Sends an (offline) peer-to-peer message to a specified user (receiver)

This version allows you to send a message to a specified user when he/she is offline. If you set a message as an offline message and the specified user is offline when you send it, the <Vg k="MESS" /> server caches it. Please note that for now we only cache 200 offline messages for up to seven days for each receiver. When the number of the cached messages reaches this limit, the newest message overrides the oldest one.


#### User attribute-related operations

This version allows you to set or update a user's attributes. You can:

- Substitutes the local user's attributes with new ones.
- Adds or updates the local user's attribute(s).
- Deletes the local user's attributes using attribute keys.
- Clears all attributes of the local user.
- Gets all attributes of a specified user.
- Gets the attributes of a specified user using attribute keys.

> - Only after you successfully loggin in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system can you execute user attribute-related operations. Otherwise, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRtmAttributeOperationErrorNotReady` error code.
> - The attributes you set will be clears when you log out of <Vg k="SIG" />.
> - You can only set a maximum of 16 KB attributes in a single method call. Otherwise, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRtmAttributeOperationErrorSizeOverflow` error code.

#### Improvements

- Supports creating an <Vg k="MESS" /> channel before logging in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system.
- Supports creating multiple <Vg k="MESS" /> channels. But a user can only join a maximum of 20 <Vg k="MESS" /> channels at the same time. When the number of the joined channels exceeds 20, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelErrorFailure` error code.

#### Issues Fixed

- Occasional system crashes.
- A user who has logged out of the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system appears online to the other users until 30 seconds later.

## v0.9.2

v0.9.2 is released on May 5th, 2019.

> This release does not support <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/createChannelWithId:delegate:">creating an RtmChannel instance</Link> before <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/loginByToken:user:completion:">logging in</Link> the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system

#### New Features

#### Queries the Online Status of the Specified Users

This release introduces a new concept: online and offline.

- Online: The user has logged in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system.
- Offline: The user has logged out of the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system.

This release adds the function of querying the online status of the specified users. After logging in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system, you can get the online status of a maximum of 256 specified users. See <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/queryPeersOnlineStatus:completion:">queryPeersOnlineStatus</Link>.

> - The sequence of the returned user IDs is identical to the input sequence.
> - The call frequency of this method is 10 times every five seconds. See [Limitations](../reference/limitations).


#### Renews the Token

In the production environment, you need to use a token to <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/loginByToken">log in</Link> the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system. Each token expires 24 hours after it is created. This release allows you to [<Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/renewToken:completion:">renew a token</Link>.

- If you are logging in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system and if your token has expired, the SDK returns the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Constants/AgoraRtmLoginErrorCode.html">AgoraRtmLoginErrorTokenExpired</Link> error code.
- if you are logged in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system, you will not be kicked out immediately when your token expires. But you need to renew your token the next time you log in the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system. Therefore, we still recommend that you renew your token when you receive the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Protocols/AgoraRtmDelegate.html#//api/name/rtmKitTokenDidExpire:">rtmKitTokenDidExpire:</Link> callback.


> - The <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/renewToken:completion:">renewToken</Link> method must be called before <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/initWithAppId:delegate:">creating an RtmClient</Link>.
> - The call frequency of the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_IOS}}//Classes/AgoraRtmKit.html#//api/name/renewToken:completion:">renewToken</Link> method is two times every second. See [Limitations](../reference/limitations).

#### Improvements

-  Supports a `userId` that starts with a space.
