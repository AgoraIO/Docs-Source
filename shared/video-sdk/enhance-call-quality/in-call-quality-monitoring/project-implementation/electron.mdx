In `IRtcEngineEventHandler`, implement the following real-time interaction quality statistics callbacks and audio or video state monitoring callbacks to understand user interaction experience:

- `onNetworkQuality`: Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality.
- `onRtcStats`: Reports real-time interaction statistics.
- `onLocalAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the sent audio stream.
- `onLocalAudioStateChanged`: Reports local audio stream state changes.
- `onRemoteAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote audio stream.
- `onRemoteAudioStateChanged`: Reports remote audio stream state changes.
- `onLocalVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the sent video stream.
- `onLocalVideoStateChanged`: Reports local video stream state changes.
- `onRemoteVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote video stream.
- `onRemoteVideoStateChanged`: Reports remote video stream state changes.

In your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, add the following code:

```typescript
@override
RtcEngineEventHandler getEventHandler() {
  return RtcEngineEventHandler(
    // Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality of each user in the channel
    onNetworkQuality: (
      RtcConnection connection,
      int remoteUid,
      QualityType txQuality,
      QualityType rxQuality,
    ) {
      // Use downlink network quality to update the network status
      print(
        'onNetworkQuality - Connection: $connection, RemoteUid: $remoteUid, TxQuality: $txQuality, RxQuality: $rxQuality',
      );
    },
    // Reports the statistics of the current call
    onRtcStats: (
      RtcConnection connection,
      RtcStats stats,
    ) {
      counter += 1;
      String msg = "";

      if (counter == 5) {
        msg = "${stats.userCount} user(s)";
      } else if (counter == 10) {
        msg = "Last mile delay: ${stats.lastmileDelay}";
        counter = 0;
      }
      if (msg.isNotEmpty) print(msg);
    },
    // Occurs when the remote video stream state changes
