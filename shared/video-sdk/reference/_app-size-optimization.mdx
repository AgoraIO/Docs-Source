A smaller app size means quicker download and installation times, which can lead to a better user experience. This page shows you how to manually install the <Vg k="VSDK" /> and reduce the app size of the SDK integrated <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Manual installation

<Setup />

## Reduce the app size

To reduce the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size, implement the following strategies:

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
### Use tree shaking

In versions before v4.19.0, the `AgoraRTC` module is the entrance to all callable methods in the Web <Vg k="VSDK" />. Even if you only use a part of the <Vg k="VSDK" />'s functionality, you still need to load the complete SDK, which may result in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> containing a lot of unused code.
The <Vg k="VSDK" /> for Web has integrated [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) support since v4.19.0. Using tree shaking has the following advantages:
- Only load the SDK features you actually use, unreferenced code will be removed during the build process.
- Reduce redundancy between SDK dependencies and your App dependencies.

To use tree shaking, import all used methods, enumerations, constants, types, and so on by adding `/esm` at the end of the package name `agora-rtc-sdk-ng`:

```javascript
// Example of correct reference citation method
import { createClient } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference enum
import { ConnectionDisconnectedReason } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference constant
import { VERSION } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference type (it is recommended to use import type instead of import to improve compilation speed)
import type { ICameraVideoTrack } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";

```
</PlatformWrapper>

### Use the audio SDK
<Vg k="VSDK" /> supports both audio and video functions, and the package size is large. If you only need to use the audio features, best practice is to integrate the [Voice SDK](../../sdks).

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web,electron,unity,flutter,react-native" >
### Remove unneeded plugins
The SDK provides optional plugin dynamic libraries. The name of the plugin is suffixed with `extension`. See the [plugin list](#plugin-list) for details on the function and size of the plugins. Refer to the following ways to exclude these plugins to reduce the size of the app.

#### Manual integration
When integrating through the official SDK download link, delete the plugin files you don't need.
