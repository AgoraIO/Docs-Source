Before you start writing your code, familiarize yourself with the core concepts that <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDKs are built on.

<a name="agora-sd-rtn"></a>
## <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />

Agora's core engagement services are powered by its Software-Defined Real-time Network (SD-RTN™) that is accessible and available anytime, anywhere around the world. The software-defined network isn’t confined by device, phone numbers, or a telecommunication provider’s coverage area like traditional networks. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> has data centers globally that cover over 200+ countries and regions. The network delivers sub-second latency and high availability of real-time video and audio anywhere on the globe. With <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, Agora can deliver live user engagement experiences in the form of real-time communication (RTC) with the following advantages:

* Unmatched quality of service
* High availability and accessibility
* True scalability
* Low Cost

## <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

[<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/) is the main dashboard where you manage your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services. <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> provides an intuitive interface for developers to query and manage their <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account. After [registering an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account](https://console.agora.io/en/signup), you use the console to perform the following tasks:

-   Manage the account
-   Create and configure <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services
-   Get an App ID
-   Manage members and roles
-   Check call quality and usage
-   Check bills and make payments
-   Access product resources

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> also provides RESTful APIs that you use to implement features such as creating a project and fetching usage numbers programmatically.

## App ID

The App ID is a random string generated within [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/) when you create a new project. You can create multiple projects in your account; each project has a different App ID. This App ID enables your app users to communicate securely with each other. When you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, you pass the App ID as an argument. The App ID is also used to create the authentication tokens that ensure secure communication in a channel. You [retrieve your App ID](https://console.agora.io/projects) using <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses this App ID to identify each app, provide billing and other statistical data services.

## App certificate

An App certificate is a string generated by <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to enable token authentication. It is required for generating an <Vg k="VSDK" /> or <Vg k="MESS" /> authentication token. To get your app certificate from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, see [Manage app certificates](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate).

## Token

A token is a dynamic key that is used by the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> authentication server to check user permissions. You use <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to generate a temporary token for testing purposes during the development process. In a production environment, you implement a token server in your security infrastructure to control access to your channels.

## Channel

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the *channel name* to identify a channel. Users who specify the same *channel name* join a common channel and interact with each other. A channel is created when the first user joins. It ceases to exist when the last user leaves.

You create a channel by calling the methods for transmitting real-time data. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses different channels to transmit different types of data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel transmits audio or video data, while the <Vg k="MESS" /> channel transmits messaging or signaling data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> and <Vg k="MESS" /> channels are independent of each other.

Additional components provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, such as On-Premise Recording and Cloud Recording, join the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel and provide real-time recording, transmission acceleration, media playback, and content moderation.

## Channel profile

The SDK applies different optimization methods according to the selected channel profile. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> supports the following channel profiles:

| Channel profile    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COMMUNICATION      | This profile is suitable for one-on-one or group calls, where all users in the channel talk freely.                                                                                                                  |
| LIVE\_BROADCASTING | In a live streaming channel, users have two client roles: *host* and *audience*. The *host* sends and receives audio or video, while the *audience* only receives audio or video with the sending function disabled. |

## User ID

A user ID (UID) identifies a user in a channel. Each user in a channel should have a unique user ID. If you do not specify a user ID when the user joins a channel, a UID is automatically generated and assigned to the user.

## Stream

A stream is a sequence of digitally-encoded coherent signals that contains audio or video data. Users in a channel [publish](#publish) local streams and [subscribe](#subscribe) to remote streams from other users.

#### Publish

Publishing is the act of sending a user’s audio or video data to the channel. Usually, the published stream is created by the audio data sampled from a microphone or the video data captured by a camera. You can also publish media streams from other sources, such as an online music file or the user’s screen.
After successfully publishing a stream, the SDK continues sending media data to other users in the channel. By publishing the local stream and subscribing to remote streams, users communicate with each other in real-time.

#### Subscribe

Subscribing is the act of receiving media streams published by remote users to the channel. A user receives audio and video data from other users by subscribing to one or more of their streams. You either directly play the subscribed streams or process incoming data for other purposes such as recording or capturing screenshots.

## User

#### Definition

Users are the initiators of behavior in Flexible Classroom. A user has the following properties:

- The user ID: The globally unique identifier of a user in Flexible Classroom.
- The user name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a nickname, Chinese name, or English name.
- The user role: Users have different roles in a classroom, such as the teacher, student, teaching assistant, and audience.
- Customized user properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize user properties, such as setting the user avatar or gender.

#### Usage

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method.

## Room

#### Definition

Rooms in Flexible Classroom are just like the physical classrooms in schools. Classes offered by different teachers with diversified teaching materials can take place in the same room at different times. A school can have different types of classrooms, such as traditional classrooms, laboratories, and multimedia classrooms. Similarly, the rooms of Flexible Classroom can be divided into several types. A room has the following properties:

- The room ID: The globally unique identifier of a room.
- The room name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a Chinese name or an English name.
- The room type: Agora supports three room types: One-to-one Classroom, Small Classroom, and Lecture Hall. These room types vary in features and the upper limit on th number of users.
- Customized room properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize room properties, such as setting the room status and room label.

#### Usage

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. A room is created automatically with the parameters (the room ID, room name, and room type) set by the first user joining the room. To join the same room with the first user, users need to call the `launch` method and pass in the same parameters (room ID, room name, and room type). Agora automatically destroys the room one hour after all users leave the room.

## Class

#### Definition

Classes in Flexible Classroom are just like the actual classes offered by different teachers in offline teaching scenarios. A class has the following properties:

- The class state: A class has three states: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Ended".
- The start time: The start time of a class. Before the start time, the class state is "Not Started". After the start time, the class state changes to "In Progress".
- The class duration: How long a class lasts. After the class duration, the class state changes to "Ended".
- The run-late time: How long a room can be open after the class ends. After the run-late time, the room is closed. Users are kicked out of the room immediately, and other users can no longer join the room.

#### Usage

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. The class properties are set by the first user joining the room.

## Stream

#### Definition

Streams in Flexible Classroom can be understood as audio and video streams and permission to send audio and video streams. Developers can call APIs to give a user permission to perform a specific operation. A user can have multiple streams. For example, a user can have both permission to send audio and video streams captured by local devices and permission to send the video stream from screen capturing.

#### Usage

Developers can call `addCoHost` to create a stream for a user and gives the user permission to send the audio or video stream. The Flexible Classroom cloud service automatically generates a stream ID. Developers can call `removeCoHost` to permanently destroy a stream and remove permission.
