### 3. Get an App Certificate

To get an App Certificate, do the following:

1.  On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, click **Config** for the project you want to use.

### 4. Generate a token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary.html#token) to authenticate users logging in <Vg k="SIG" />.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTM tokens. To generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

1.  Visit https://webdemo.agora.io/token-builder.

2.  Fill in the App ID, App certificate, and user ID to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />. You need to specify the user ID yourself (for example, "test"). The generated RTM token is showed on the screen. When calling the `login` method later, ensure that the user ID is the same with the one that you use to generate the RTM token.

### 5. Configure the sample project

#### Approach 1: Configure through the Agora asset package

1.  Open **Unity** and click **New** to create a new Unity project.

2.  Download the latest version of Agora asset package for Unity on [GiHub](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Agora-Unity-RTM-SDK/releases).

3.  In the Unity Editor, select **Assets** &gt; **Import Package** &gt; **Custom Package**.

4.  Select the **Agora asset package** and click **Open**.

5.  All files of the asset package are chosen by default. Uncheck the files that you do not need and click **Import**.

6.  Click **MainScene** &gt; **ChatManager** in **Hierarchy** list.

7.  Find **Agora Properties** in **Inspector** list, and enter the App ID and the RTM token.

#### Approach 2: Configure through the Agora SDK

1.  Download the latest version of the [Agora <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />](../reference/downloads.html).

2.  Find `./samples/Unity-RTM-Demo` folder in the SDK package and open it it in Unity.

3.  Copy the `Rtm-Scripts` folder under the `libs` folder in the SDK package to the `Assets` folder of the project path.

4.  Copy the following files under the `libs/Plugins` path in the SDK package to the corresponding path of the project:

    | Development Platform | File or folder    | Project directory          |     |
    |----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----|
    | Android              | `Plugins/Android` | `/Assets/Plugins/Android/` |     |
    | iOS                  | `Plugins/iOS`     | `/Assets/Plugins/iOS`      |     |
    | macOS                | `Plugins/macOS`   | `/Assets/Plugins/macOS`    |     |
    | Windows              | `Plugins/x86`     | `/Assets/Plugins/x86`      |     |
    | Windows              | `Plugins/x86_64`  | `/Assets/Plugins/x86_64`   |     |

5.  Click **MainScene** &gt; **ChatManager** in Unityâ€™s Hierarchy list.

6.  Find **Agora Properties** in Inspector list, and enter the App ID and the RTM token.

### 6. Run the sample project

Run the sample project according to the following steps:

1.  Click the **File** menu bar in Unity, and set the device you need to run through **Build Settings**.

2.  Click the **Play** button at the top of the Unity main interface to run the sample project directly, or click **File** &gt; **Build And Run** in the menu bar to compile and run the sample project. If the project runs successfully, you can see the following screen on your device:

    ![1625553123694](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625553123694)

Now you can experience the RTM. You can also use the [Agora RTM Web sample app](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Web/) to interact with your device. Ensure that you enter the same App ID, channel name, and RTM token in the Agora RTM Web sample app.
