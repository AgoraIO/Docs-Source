All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomAnnouncement` to retrieve the chat room announcements.

```dart
try {
  String? announcement =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(
    roomId,

}
```

### Update the chat room announcements

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `updateChatRoomAnnouncement` to set and update the announcements. The length of the chat room announcements can be a maximum of 512 characters.
