<Vg k="WHITE" /> rooms enable users to present ideas, share multi-media content, and collaborate on projects on a shared whiteboard from multiple devices simultaneously.

This article describes how to create a basic project and use the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> to implement basic whiteboard features.

## Understand the tech
The following figure shows the workflow to join an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1620443996218)

When an app client requests to join an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room, the app client and your app server interact with the <Vg k="WHITE" /> server in the following stepsï¼š
1. The app server sends a request with the SDK token to the <Vg k="WHITE" /> server to create a whiteboard room.
2. The <Vg k="WHITE" /> server returns the room UUID to the app server when a room is created successfully.
3. The app server generates a room token using the returned room UUID and sends the room token and UUID to the app client.
4. The app client initializes a <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> instance with the App Identifier received from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.
5. The app client calls a method to join the <Vg k="WHITE" /> room using the room UUID and room token.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- iOS 9.0 or later
- The [latest version](https://cocoapods.org/) of CocoaPods
- A valid [Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#sign-up-and-log-in)
- An Agora project with the <Vg k="WHITE" /> enabled. Get the app identifier and SDK token from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. See [Enable and configure <Vg k="WHITE" />](../develop/enable-whiteboard)

## Create a project in Xcode

This section describes how to create Single View App in Xcode.

### Create an Objective-C project

To create an Objective-C project in Xcode, perform the following steps:
- Set **Product Name** to `Whiteboard`.
- Set **Organization Identifier** to `agora`.
- Select `Objective-C` for **Language**.



### Create a Swift project

To create a Swift project in Xcode, perform the following steps:

- Set **Product Name** to `Whiteboard`.
- Set **Organization Identifier** to `agora`.
- Select `Swift` for **Language**.
- Select `Storyboard` for **User Interface**.

The <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> uses Objective-C. To use the Objective-C SDK in your Swift app, you need to create an Objective-C bridging header file, as follows:

- Add a `Whiteboard-Bridging_Header.h` file to your project.
- Add the following import line in the `Whiteboard-Bridging_Header.h` file:

  ```
  #import <Whiteboard/Whiteboard.h>
  ```

## Get <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" />

1. In Terminal, go to the directory of your Xcode project. Run the following command to create a `Podfile`, after which you can find the `Podfile` under the project directory.

    ```
    pod init
    ```

2. Add the following lines to the `Podfile`:

     ```objective-c
    platform :ios, '10.0'
    target 'Whiteboard' do
          pod 'Whiteboard'
    end
    ```

3. Run the following command to install the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" />:

     ```
    pod install
    ```

After installation, open the `Whiteboard.xcworkspace` file for further editing.


## Implement whiteboard features

The <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> has now been integrated into the iOS project. Next, call the core APIs in the SDK to implement basic whiteboard features.

### 1. Create a room

Before an app client requests to join a room, you need to call the <Vg k="WHITE" /> RESTful API on your app server to create a room. See [Create a room (POST)](../reference/whiteboard-api/room-management#create-a-room-post).

**Request example**

Refer to the following Node.js script to send an HTTP request:

<Admonition type="info">
Before sending an HTTP request using Node.js, make sure that you have installed the `request` module. You can run the command line `npm install request` to install the module.
</Admonition>

```javascript
var request = require("request");
var options = {
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.netless.link/v5/rooms",
  "headers": {
  "token": "Your SDK Token",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "region": "us-sv"
  }
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "isRecord": false
  })
};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

If the request is successful, Agora's server for the <Vg k="WHITE" /> returns information about the created room, including the `uuid`, which is the unique identifier of the room. You need to pass in this parameter when an app client joins the room.

**Response example**

```javascript
{
    "uuid": "4a50xxxxxx796b", // The Room UUID
    "teamUUID": "RMmLxxxxxx15aw",
    "appUUID": "i54xxxxxx1AQ",
	"isRecord": false,
    "isBan": false,
    "createdAt": "2021-01-18T06:56:29.432Z",
    "limit": 0
}
```


### 2. Generate a Room Token

After creating a room and getting the `uuid` of the room, you need to generate a Room Token on your app server and send it to the app client. When an app client joins a room, Agora's server uses the Room Token for authentication.

To generate a Room Token on your app server, you can:

- Use code. See [Generate a Token from your app server](../develop/generate-token-app-server). (Recommended)
- Call the <Vg k="WHITE" /> RESTful API. See [Generate a Room Token (POST)](../develop/generate-token-rest#generate-a-room-token-post).

The following examples describe how to use the <Vg k="WHITE" /> RESTful API to generate a Room Token.

**Request example**

Refer to the following Node.js script to send an HTTP request:

<div class="alert info">Before sending an HTTP request using Node.js, make sure that you have installed the `request` module. You can run the command line `npm install request` to install the module.</div>

```javascript
var request = require('request');
var options = {
  "method": "POST",
  // Replace <Room UUID> with your Room UUID
  "url": "https://api.netless.link/v5/tokens/rooms/<Room UUID>",
  "headers": {
    "token": "Your SDK Token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
	"region": "us-sv"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({"lifespan":3600000,"role":"admin"})

};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```


If the request is successful, Agora's server returns a Room Token.

**Response example**
```javascript
"NETLESSROOM_YWs9XXXXXXXXXXXZWNhNjk" // Room Token
```


### 3. Initialize the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> and join a room

Edit `ViewController.m` to add a view, initialize the SDK, and join a room. You need to pass in the following parameters:
- `appIdentifier`: If you use versions earlier than v2.15.0, do not pass in `uid`, the unique identifier of the <Vg k="WHITE" /> project. See [Get security credentials for your <Vg k="WHITE" /> project](../develop/enable-whiteboard).
- `uuid`: The unique identifier of the room. See [Create a room](#1-create-a-room).
- `uid`: The unique identifier of a user in a string format. The maximum length is 1024 bytes. If you use v2.15.0 and later versions, you must pass in this parameter; if you use versions earlier than v2.15.0, do not pass in this parameter.
- `roomToken`: The Room Token used for authentication. The Room Token must be generated using the Room UUID above. See [Generate a Room Token](#generate-a-room-token).
- `region`: The data center, which must be the same as the data center you chose when creating the room.

```swift // ViewController.swift
//  Whiteboard
import UIKit
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var config:WKWebViewConfiguration?
    var boardView:WhiteBoardView?
    var roomConfig:WhiteRoomConfig?
    var memberState:WhiteMemberState?
    var room:WhiteRoom?
    var sdk:WhiteSDK?
    var sdkConfig:WhiteSdkConfiguration?
    var commonDelegate:WhiteCommonCallbackDelegate?
    var roomCallbackDelegate:WhiteRoomCallbackDelegate?
    // Add a view
    func setupViews()
    {
        self.config = WKWebViewConfiguration()
        // Set the view of the whiteboard to full-screen
        self.boardView = WhiteBoardView(frame: CGRect(x:0, y:0, width:self.view.bounds.width,height:self.view.bounds.height), configuration: self.config!)
        self.view.addSubview(self.boardView!)
    }
    // Initialize the SDK
    func initSDK()
    {   // Pass in the App Identifier
        self.sdkConfig = WhiteSdkConfiguration(app: "Your App Indentifier")
		// Set the data center as Silicon Valley, US
		sdkConfig.region = WhiteRegionUS
        // Initialize the SDK
        self.sdk = WhiteSDK(whiteBoardView: self.boardView!, config: self.sdkConfig!, commonCallbackDelegate: self.commonDelegate)
    }
    // Join a whiteboard room
    func joinRoom()
    {
        // Pass in the Room UUID, uid of a user, and Room Token.
		// If you use versions earlier than v2.15.0, do not pass in uid: "user uid".
        self.roomConfig = WhiteRoomConfig(uuid: "Your uuid", roomToken:"Your room token", uid: "user uid")
        // Set the whiteboard tool
        self.memberState = WhiteMemberState()
        self.memberState?.currentApplianceName = WhiteApplianceNameKey.AppliancePencil
        self.memberState?.strokeColor = [255,0,0]
        // Join the room
        self.sdk!.joinRoom(with: self.roomConfig!, callbacks: roomCallbackDelegate, completionHandler: { (Success, room, error) in
            if (Success)
            {
                self.room = room
                self.room!.setMemberState(self.memberState!)
                NSLog("Successfully joined the room")
            }
            else
            {
                NSLog("Errors when joining room")
            }
        })
        }
    // In viewDidLoad, call the corresponding functions to add a view, initialize the SDK, and join a room
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.setupViews()
        self.initSDK()
        self.joinRoom()
    }
}
```
