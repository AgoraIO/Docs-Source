### Create a project
If you have already started a Unity project, skip to [Integrate the SDK](#integrate-the-sdk) section.

To create a new Unity project:

1. Open Unity and click **New**.
1. Fill in the following information, and then click **Create project**.
    * **Project name** : The name of the project
    * **Location** : Project storage path
    * **Template** : The project type. Select **3D**

### Integrate the SDK
1. Go to the [Download SDKs](../../sdks) page and download the latest version of Unity SDK.
1. Launch your Unity editor and import the SDK package. 

    All plug-ins are selected by default. Uncheck any plug-ins that you do not need, then click **Import**.

### Create a user interface

Create a user interface (UI) for your project based on your application scenario. A basic UI consists of the following components:

* Local view window
* Remote view window
* Join and Leave channel buttons

To create a basic UI, refer to the following steps:

1. Create join and leave channel buttons

    1. In your Unity project, right-click the Sample Scene and select **Game Object > UI > Button**. You see a button on the scene canvas.

    1. In the **Inspector** panel, rename the Button to `Leave` and adjust the position coordinates according to your needs. For example:

        * **Pos X**：`-350`
        * **Pos Y**: `-172`

    1. Select the **Text** control of the **Leave** button , and change the text content to `Leave` in the **Inspector** panel.

    1. Repeat the previous steps to create a **Join** button.

1. Create local and remote view windows

    1. Right-click the Canvas and select **UI > Raw Image**.

    1. In the **Inspector** panel, rename `Raw Image` to `LocalView` and adjust its size and position on the canvas. For example:

        * **PosX**：`-250`
        * **Pos Y**: `0`
        * **Width**: `250`
        * **Height**: `250`
        
    1. Repeat the above steps to create a remote view window, name it `RemoteView` , and adjust its position on the canvas:

        * **PosX**：`250`
        * **Pos Y**: `0`
        * **Width**: `250`
        * **Height**: `250`

        Save the changes. 
        
At this point your UI looks similar to the following:
