To optimize the user experience when dealing with a large number of push notifications, instant messaging IM provides fine-grained options for push notification methods and do not disturb mode at the app and conversation levels.

** Push notification method **

The push notification method parameters are described in the following table:

| Parameters      | Description    | App   | Single and group chat sessions   |
| :------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
|  ` ALL `  | Receive push notifications for all offline messages. | ✓ | ✓ |
|  ` MENTION_ONLY `  | Only receive push notifications for mention messages. < br />This parameter is recommended for group chats. If you want to mention one or more users, you need to pass "em_at_list": [ "user1", "user2" ... ] to the ` ext ` field when creating a message ; if you want to mention everyone, pass "em_at_list": "all" to this field. | ✓ | ✓ |
|  ` NONE `    | Do not receive push notifications for offline messages. | ✓      | ✓ |

The push notification method setting at the session level takes precedence over the setting at the app level. For sessions where the push notification method is not set, the app setting is used by default.

For example, suppose the push method for the app is set to MENTION_ONLY and the push method for a given conversation is set to ALL . You will receive all push notifications from that conversation, but for all other conversations, you will only receive push notifications for messages that mention you.

** Do Not Disturb Mode **

After you have completed SDK initialization and successfully logged into the app, you can enable offline push for the app and various types of sessions, and turn off push by setting the Do Not Disturb mode.

You can specify the DND time period and DND duration at the app level, and IM will not send offline push notifications during these two time periods. If both the DND time period and DND duration are set, the DND mode will take effect for the sum of these two time periods.

The following table describes the Do Not Disturb time parameters:

| Parameters      |   Description    |    App   | Single and group chat sessions   |
| :--------| :----- | :------------------- | :----- |
| `SILENT_MODE_INTERVAL` | The time period for triggering offline push notifications every day, using the 24-hour system, accurate to the minute, in the format of H:MH:M, for example, 8:30-10:0, the range of hours and minutes in the start time and end time is [0,23] and [0,59] respectively. The setting of the Do Not Disturb time period is as follows: <ul><li>After the start time and end time are set, the Do Not Disturb mode is triggered every day. For example, if the time period is set to `8:0`-`10:0`, the Do Not Disturb mode is effective from 8:00 to 10:00 every day. If you set the start time to 8:0 and the end time to 12:0 at 11:00, the Do Not Disturb mode is effective from 11:00 to 12:00 on the same day, and from 8:00 to 12:00 every day thereafter. </li><li> If the start time and end time are the same, the Do Not Disturb mode is effective all day. However, if it is set to `0:0-0:0`, the Do Not Disturb mode will be turned off. </li><li>If the end time is earlier than the start time, the Do Not Disturb mode will take effect from the start time of each day to the end time of the next day. For example, if the start time is `10:0` and the end time is `8:0`, the Do Not Disturb mode will take effect from 10:00 on that day to 8:00 on the next day. </li><li>Currently, the Do Not Disturb mode can only be enabled during a specified time period each day. Multiple Do Not Disturb time periods are not supported. The new setting will overwrite the previous setting. </li><li>If both this parameter and `SILENT_MODE_DURATION` are set, the DND mode will be in effect during both time periods on the day. For example, if `SILENT_MODE_INTERVAL` is set to 8:0-10:0 and `SILENT_MODE_DURATION` is set to 240 minutes (4 hours) at 8:00 am, the app will be in DND mode from 8:00-12:00 on the day and from 8:00-10:00 every day thereafter. </li></ul> | ✓ | ✗ |
|  ` SILENT_MODE_DURATION ` | Do not disturb duration, in minutes. The value range of the do not disturb duration is [ 0,10080 ] , ` 0 ` means the parameter is invalid, ` 10080 ` means the do not disturb mode lasts for 7 days. < br /> Unlike the setting of the do not disturb time period, which takes effect every day, this parameter is valid once. It takes effect immediately after setting. For example, if you set the app-level ` SILENT_MODE_DURATION ` to 240 minutes (4 hours) at 8:00 am, the app will be in do not disturb mode from 8:00 to 12:00 on the same day. < br /> - If both this parameter and ` SILENT_MODE_INTERVAL ` are set, the DND mode will be effective during both time periods on the same day. For example, if the app-level ` SILENT_MODE_INTERVAL ` is set to 8:00-10:00 at 8:00 am and the DND duration is set to 240 minutes (4 hours), the app will be in DND mode from 8:00-12:00 now and from 8:00-10:00 every day thereafter.     | ✓      | ✓ |

If you need to push messages to specific users during the do not disturb period or the effective time, you need to set [ Force push ] ( ./7_push_extension#Force push ) .

** Relationship between push notification method and do not disturb time setting **

For an app and all sessions in the app, the Do Not Disturb mode setting takes precedence over the push notification method setting. For example, suppose you specify a Do Not Disturb time period at the app level and set the push notification method for the specified session to ` ALL ` . The app enters Do Not Disturb mode during the specified time period, and you will not receive any push notifications.

Alternatively, suppose a session is assigned a quiet time period, and the app does not have any quiet settings and its push notification method is set to ` ALL ` . During the specified quiet time period, you will not receive any push notifications from this session, while push notifications from all other sessions remain unchanged.

## Set up push notifications for the app

You can call the ` setSilentModeForAll` method to set app-level push notifications, and set the push notification method and do not disturb mode by specifying the ` SilentModeParam` field, as shown in the following code example:

```java
// Set push notification mode to `MENTION_ONLY`.
SilentModeParam param =  new  SilentModeParam ( SilentModeParam . SilentModeParamType . REMIND_TYPE )
                                .setRemindType(PushManager.PushRemindType.MENTION_ONLY);
// Set the offline push do not disturb timer to 15 minutes.
SilentModeParam param =  new  SilentModeParam ( SilentModeParam . SilentModeParamType . SILENT_MODE_DURATION )
                                .setSilentModeDuration(15);
// Set the do not disturb time period for offline push to 8:30 to 15:00.
SilentModeParam param =  new  SilentModeParam ( SilentModeParam . SilentModeParamType . SILENT_MODE_INTERVAL )
                                .setSilentModeInterval(new SilentModeTime(8, 30), new SilentModeTime(15, 0));
// Set up offline push notifications for the app.
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().setSilentModeForAll(param, new ValueCallBack<SilentModeResult>(){});
```

## Get the push notification settings of the app

You can call the getSilentModeForAll method to get the app-level push notification settings, as shown in the following code example:

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().getSilentModeForAll(new ValueCallBack<SilentModeResult>(){
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(SilentModeResult result) {
        // Get the push notification method settings of the app.
        PushManager.PushRemindType remindType = result.getRemindType();
        // Get the Unix timestamp of the app's offline push Do Not Disturb expiration.
        long timestamp = result.getExpireTimestamp();
        // Get the start time of the app's offline push do not disturb time period.
        SilentModeTime startTime = result.getSilentModeStartTime();
        startTime . getHour(); // The hour in the start time of the do not disturb time period.
        startTime . getMinute(); // The number of minutes in the start time of the do not disturb time period.
        // Get the end time of the app's offline push do not disturb time period.
        SilentModeTime endTime = result.getSilentModeEndTime();
        endTime . getHour(); // The number of hours in the end time of the do not disturb period.
        endTime . getMinute(); // The number of minutes in the end time of the do not disturb time period.
    }
    @Override
    public void onError(int error, String errorMsg) {}
});
```

## Set push notifications for a single session

You can call the ` setSilentModeForConversation` method to set push notifications for a specified conversation, and set the push notification method and the do not disturb mode by specifying the `SilentModeParam` field, as shown in the following code example :

```java
// Set push notification mode to `MENTION_ONLY`.
SilentModeParam param =  new  SilentModeParam ( SilentModeParam . SilentModeParamType . REMIND_TYPE )
                                .setRemindType(PushManager.PushRemindType.MENTION_ONLY);

// Set the offline push do not disturb timer to 15 minutes.
SilentModeParam param =  new  SilentModeParam ( SilentModeParam . SilentModeParamType . SILENT_MODE_DURATION )
                                .setSilentDuration(15);
// Set the offline push do not disturb mode for the session. Currently, it does not support setting the do not disturb time period for the session.
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().setSilentModeForConversation(conversationId, conversationType, param, new ValueCallBack<SilentModeResult>(){});
```

## Get push notification settings for a single session

You can call the getSilentModeForConversation method to get the push notification settings for a specified conversation, as shown in the following code example:

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().getSilentModeForConversation(conversationId, conversationType, new ValueCallBack<SilentModeResult>(){
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(SilentModeResult result) {
        // Get whether the push notification method is set for the specified session.
        boolean enable = result.isConversationRemindTypeEnabled();
        // Check if the session has push notifications set.
        if(enable){
            // Get the push notification method for the session.
            PushManager.PushRemindType remindType = result.getRemindType();
        }
        // Get the offline push Do Not Disturb expiration Unix timestamp of the session.
        long timestamp = result.getExpireTimestamp();
    }
    @Override
    public void onError(int error, String errorMsg) {}
});
```

## Get push notification settings for multiple sessions

1. You can get push notification settings for up to 20 sessions in each call.

2. If the session uses app settings or its push notification settings have expired, the returned dictionary does not contain this session.

You can call the getSilentModeForConversations method to get the push notification settings for multiple conversations, as shown in the following sample code:

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().getSilentModeForConversations(conversationList, new ValueCallBack<Map<String, SilentModeResult>>(){
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(Map<String, SilentModeResult> value) {}
    @Override
    public void onError(int error, String errorMsg) {}
});
```

## Clear push notification settings for a single session

You can call the ` clearRemindTypeForConversation` method to clear the push notification type for a specific conversation. After clearing, the conversation will use the app's settings by default.

The following code example shows how to clear a session's push notifications:

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().pushManager().clearRemindTypeForConversation(conversationId, conversationType, new CallBack(){});
```
