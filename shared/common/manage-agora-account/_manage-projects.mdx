## Create and Manage Projects

This page shows how to create a project, view project information, and manage app certificates in Agora Console.

### Restrictions

1. If your account has multiple members, only those with the role of *Admin*, *Engineer*, or an authorized custom role have access to the *Project Management* page.
2. Each Agora account can create up to 10 projects, including deleted projects. If you need to create more projects, contact Agora by [submitting a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/).

### Create an Agora project

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. Enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click *Create*.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check *Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)* as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click *Submit*. You can now see the project on the *Project Management* page.

### View project information

For a project listed on the *Project Management* page, you can do the following:

1. View basic information, such as the stage, name, and creation date of the project.
2. Click image:https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532[] to copy the https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/term_appid[App ID] of the project.
3. Click *Config* to enter the project detail page, where you can view and configure *App certificate*, *Project status*, and *Extensions*.

### Manage app certificates

An app certificate is a string generated by Console to enable token authentication. For different security requirements, Agora provides the following app certificate options:

1. Primary certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for temporary use or production environments.
2. Secondary certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for production environments only and does not apply to RESTful APIs.
3. No certificate: This certificate appears only if you choose *APP ID* as the authentication mechanism when creating a project.


#### Enable the primary certificate

For high-security scenarios, enable the primary certificate as follows:

1. If you choose *APP ID + Token* as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, the primary certificate is enabled by default. On the project detail page, you can click the ![Image](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532) under *Primary certificate* to view and copy it.
2. If you choose *APP ID* as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, you need to enable the primary certificate manually. On the project detail page, click the switch under *Primary certificate* to enable it.

Once the primary certificate is enabled, you can click ![Image](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532) to view and copy it. In this case, both the App ID and primary certificate can be used to generate tokens for authentication.


#### Enable the secondary certificate

If you need to change the primary certificate after enabling it, you can enable the secondary certificate.

On the project detail page, click the switch under *Secondary certificate*.

Once the secondary certificate is enabled, you can click <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" style={{width: '24px'}} /> to view and copy it. In this case, both the primary and secondary certificate can be used to generate tokens for authentication. 

#### Switch to a new primary certificate

If the primary certificate is exposed to security risks, you can use the secondary certificate as a new primary certificate and delete the original primary certificate.

To switch to a new primary certificate, follow these steps:

1. `<<secondary,Enable the secondary certificate>>`.
2. On the project detail page, click *Set as primary* to the right of *Secondary certificate*. The secondary certificate and the primary certificate are switched.
3. Click the switch under *Secondary certificate* to disable the current secondary certificate.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the status of the secondary certificate is updated to *Disabled*, and the *Delete* button appears.

5. Click the *Delete* button.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the *Delete* button disappears, and the current secondary certificate (the original primary certificate) is deleted.

#### Delete the no certificate option

*No certificate* is enabled only if you choose *APP ID* as the authentication mechanism when creating a project. *No certificate* means that your project uses only the App ID for authentication, which is less secure.

To delete the no certificate option, follow these steps:

1. `<<primary,Enable the primary certificate>>`.
2. Click the *Delete* button to the right of *No certificate*.
