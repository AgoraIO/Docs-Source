    ```javascript
    // Exclude Mainland China from the regions for connection
    AgoraRTC.setArea({
        areaCode:"GLOBAL",
        excludedArea:"CHINA"
        })
    // You can use [] to exclude more than one region.
    ```
Now, you can see yourself and remote user on the device screen. It means your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has made a connection with the specified region <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.
