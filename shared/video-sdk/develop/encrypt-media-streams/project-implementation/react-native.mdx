To add built-in media stream encryption to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following steps:

<KeyAndSalt />

2. Implement client-side logic

    1. Obtain a String key and Base64-encoded salt from the server.

    1. Convert the salt from Base64 to `uint8_t`.

    1. Before joining the channel, call `enableEncryption` to set the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode, and pass the key and salt to the SDK.

<Admonition type="caution" title="note">
- All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt. Discrepancies may lead to unexpected behavior, such as black screens or audio loss.
- To ensure security, best practice is to use a new key and salt each time you enable media stream encryption.
</Admonition>

To implement this logic, refer to the following code:

```typescript
// Enable built-in encryption
enableEncryption = () => {
  // Built-in encryption mode is Aes128Xts
  const encryptionMode = EncryptionMode.Aes128Xts;
  // Built-in encryption key
  const encryptionKey = '';
  // Salt
  const encryptionKdfSalt = new Array(32).fill(1, 0, 32);
  if (!encryptionKey) {
    this.error("encryptionKey is invalid");
    return;
  }
  rtcEngine.enableEncryption(true, {
    encryptionMode,
    encryptionKey,
    encryptionKdfSalt,
  });
};

// Disable built-in encryption
disableEncryption = () => {
  rtcEngine.enableEncryption(false, {});
};
```
