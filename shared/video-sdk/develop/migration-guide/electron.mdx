Agora SDK v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> is a new version of the SDK that you can use to embed real-time video and audio into your app. It supports large-scale real-time interactive activities and provides better real-time interactive effects. For details, see [Product overview](../overview/product-overview).

This page introduces the main steps to upgrade the SDK from v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> to v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, as well as the related changes.

## Migration steps

This section introduces the main steps to upgrade the SDK from v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />  to v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />.

1. **Integrate the SDK**

    See Project setup for more information about integrating the v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> SDK into your project.

2. **Update the Agora code in your app**
    
    The v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> SDK has optimized or modified the implementation of some functions, resulting in incompatibility with the v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />  SDK. In order to retain Agora functionality in your app, update the code in your app according to <Link to="#what-has-changed">What has changed</Link>.

## What has changed

This section is based on v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />  and introduces the main changes of v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> compared to v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> in the following categories. You need to update the code of your app according to your business scenario.

    * _Breaking changes_: Introduces API compatibility changes. You need to spend significant time modifying the related implementation.
    * _Behavior changes_: Introduces changes caused by reasonable optimization of the SDK default behavior and API behavior. Less time is required to modify the related implementation, if any.
    * _Function gaps_: Introduces functions that were supported in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> but are not supported in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />. However, these functions are intended to be added in a future release.
    * _Removed APIs_: Introduces APIs that were supported in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> but removed in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />. Most of these APIs have alternatives in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />. Modifying the related implementation should require less time.
    * _Naming and data type changes_: Introduces the naming and data type changes of the main APIs. You can update the relevant implementation according to the error message in the IDE, which is expected to take less time.

### Breaking changes (v3.x to v4.0.0)

After upgrading from v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> to v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the way the APIs implement some functions is different. This section introduces compatibility changes for these APIs and the logic for updating the code of your app.

    **Initialize engine**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK provides the initialize method to create and initialize the `RtcEngine` instance.

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the SDK provides the `createAgoraRtcEngine` method to create the `RtcEngine` instance, and the `initialize` method to initialize the engine.

    **Register event listener**
    
    Take `onError` as an example:
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK provides the `on` method to register event listener.

    ```javascript
    this.engine.on('error', (err, msg) => {});
    ```

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the SDK provides the `registerEventHandler` method to register event listener.

    ```javascript
    this.engine.registerEventHandler({
    onError(err: ErrorCodeType, msg: string) {},
    });
    ```

    **Multiple channels**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK provides the `AgoraRtcChannel` class and the on function under the `AgoraRtcChannel` class to implement multi-channel control. The v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> SDK supports subscribing to the audio and video streams of multiple channels, but only supports publishing one group of audio and video streams in one channel.

    v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> introduces the following changes:

        * The SDK provides the `IRtcEngineEx` class to join multiple channels. After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
        
        * Added a binary group `RtcConnection` to represent the connection established by `joinChannel`. A connection is determined by the channel name (`channelId`) and `localUid`. You can control the publishing and subscribing state of different connections through `RtcConnection`. The SDK adds Ex in the name of all APIs with a connection parameter (corresponding to the `RtcConnection` class) to distinguish them, and gathers these APIs in the `IRtcEngineEx` class to implement more multi-stream functions.

    Combined with the multi-channel capability, you can also experience the following functions:

        * Publish multiple groups of audio and video streams to the remote user through different `localUids`.
       
        * Mix multiple audio streams and publish them to the remote user through one `localUid`.
       
        * Mix multiple video streams and publish them to the remote user through one `localUid`.

    `AgoraRtcChannel` and `IRtcEngine` of v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> are partially duplicated and overlap in their functionality, so v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> hides the `AgoraRtcChannel` class and the on function under the `AgoraRtcChannel` class. See the <Link to = "https://github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Electron-SDK/tree/main/example/src/renderer/examples/advanced/JoinMultipleChannel"> JoinMultiChannel </Link> sample project for more details on how to replace `AgoraRtcChannel` with joinChannel and `ChannelMediaOptions`. The expected migration cost is one day or less.

    If you need to continue to use the `AgoraRtcChannel` class and the on function under the `AgoraRtcChannel` class, [Contact Us](mailto:support@agora.io). The decision whether to maintain compatibility in a future release is based on your feedback.

    **Media stream publishing control**
    
        In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the SDK gathers more channel-related settings into `ChannelMediaOptions`, including publishing of audio and video streams from different sources, automatic subscribing of audio and video streams, user role switching, token updating, and default dual stream options. You can determine the media stream publishing and subscribing behavior by calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` when joining a channel, or you can flexibly update the media options by calling `updateChannelMediaOptions` after joining a channel, such as switching video sources.

        See the <Link to = "https://github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Electron-SDK/tree/main/example/src/renderer/examples/advanced/JoinMultipleChannel"> JoinMultiChannel </Link> sample project to update the code in your app.

    **Warning codes**
    
        In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK returns warning codes through the Warning event.

        To facilitate locating and troubleshooting issues, v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> reports problems and causes through the return values of APIs or different callbacks for listening to states. For example:

            * `getConnectionState`: Reports the network connection state.
            * `onLocalAudioStateChanged`: Reports the local audio state.
            * `onLocalVideoStateChanged`: Reports the local video state.
            * `onRemoteAudioStateChanged`: Reports the remote audio state.
            * `onRemoteVideoStateChanged`: Reports the remote video state.
        As a consequence, v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes the Warning event.

### Breaking changes (v4.0.0 Beta to v4.0.0)
    
    **SDK package name**
    
    After updating from v4.0.0 Beta to v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the SDK package name has changed from `electron-agora-rtc-ng` to `agora-electron-sdk`, see <Link to = "../get-started/get-started-sdk#project-setup">Intergrate the SDK </Link>.

    **Join channel**
    
    In v4.0.0 Beta, the SDK provides the `joinChannel` and `joinChannelWithOptions` methods to join a channel.

    ```javascript
    this._engine?.joinChannel(token: string, channelId: string, info: string, uid: number): number;
    this._engine?.joinChannelWithOptions(token: string, channelId: string, uid: number, options: ChannelMediaOptions): number;
    ```

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the original `joinChannel` is removed, and the original `joinChannelWithOptions` is renamed to `joinChannel`.

    ```javascript
    this._engine?.joinChannel(
        token: string,
        channelId: string,
        uid: number,
        options: ChannelMediaOptions
        ): number;
    ```

    Besides, `publishAudioTrack` in the `ChannelMediaOptions` enum is replaced with `publishMicrophoneTrack`. If you used this feature in v4.0.0 Beta and wish to upgrade to v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, modify the implementation code of the feature after upgrading the SDK.

### Behavior changes
    
    This section introduces changes caused by reasonable optimization of the SDK default behavior and API behavior.

    **Channel profile**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the default channel profile is `ChannelProfileCommunication` (the communication profile).

    Because the interactive streaming profile supports seamless switching from one-to-one calls to multi-user interaction, since v3.0.0, Agora has changed the internal transmission protocol and the ability to resist poor network conditions in the communication profile to be consistent with the interactive streaming profile. In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, Agora also changed the default channel profile to `ChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting` (the interactive streaming profile).

    **Network quality callback**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, if the `uid` parameter returned in `onNetworkQuality` is `0`, the callback reports the network quality of the local user. In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the `uid` of the local user returned in this callback is the same as the local user's actual `uid` in the channel.

    **Default log file**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, when the SDK creates multiple log files, the earlier files are named in a `agorasdk_x.log` format, such as `agorasdk_1.log`. v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> modified the naming format to `agorasdk.x.log`, such as `agorasdk.1.log`. Additionally, v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> adds the `agoraapi.log` file to record API logs.

    **Fast channel switching**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, you need to call `switchChannel` to quickly switch a channel.

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, you can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannel` in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> by switching a channel through `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel`. Therefore, v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes `switchChannel`. If you call `switchChannel` to quickly switch a channel in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, you need to call `leaveChannel` to leave the current channel in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> and `joinChannel` to join the second channel instead.

    **Agora self-developed extensions**

    v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> adds the feature of automatically loading self-developed dynamic libraries based on v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> Beta. As of this release, when using an Agora self-developed extension, you do not need to manually integrate the dynamic library in the project. The SDK automatically loads the dynamic library during the initialization phase of `IRtcEngine`. You can directly call the corresponding method of the extension to enable this feature.

| API	| Extension type|
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `enableVirtualBackground` | Virtual background extension |
  <ul><li>`setVideoDenoiserOptions`</li><li>`setLowlightEnhanceOptions`</li><li>`setBeautyEffectOption`</li><li>`setColorEnhanceOptions`</li></ul> |Video enhancement extension |
| `enableRemoteSuperResolution`  |  Super resolution extension |
| <ul><li>`setAudioEffectPreset`</li><li>`setVoiceBeautifierPreset`</li><li>`setVoiceConversionPreset`</li></ul> | Voice beautifier extension |
| `enableSpatialAudio` | Spatial audio extension|
| `enableRemoteSuperResolution`  | Super resolution extension |
| `enableContentInspect` |  Content moderation extension |

    **Local audio and video recording**

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK does not support local audio and video recording.
    
    In v 4.0.0, if you want to enable local audio and video recording, you need to call the `getMediaRecorder` method to get the `IMediaRecorder` object.

    **Virtual metronome**

    When you call `startRhythmPlayer`, the SDK publishes the sound of the virtual metronome to the remote by default. If you do not want the remote users to hear the virtual metronome, refer to the following operations:

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, call the `configRhythmPlayer`, and set publish to false.
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, set `publishRhythmPlayerTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions` to false.

    **Volume indication**

    You can call the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method to enable the user's volume indication function. There is a difference in the definition of the interval parameter in the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method between v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> and v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, as follows:

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, Agora recommends that you set the interval to be greater than 200 ms. The minimum is 10 ms; otherwise, the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback is not received.
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, you must set the interval to an integer that is a multiple of 200 ms. If the value of interval is lower than 200, the SDK automatically adjusts it to 200.

    When the user's volume indication is enabled, the SDK triggers the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback at the time interval set in this method. If the local user calls `muteLocalAudioStream` to mute themselves, the SDK behaves inconsistently between v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> and v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />:

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, the SDK immediately stops reporting the local user's volume indication callback.
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the SDK continues to report the local user's volume indication callback.

    **Device permissions**
    
    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, `AudioLocalError.DeviceNoPermission` in the `LocalAudioStateChanged` event reports that there is no permission to start the capture device, and `LocalVideoStreamError` in the `LocalVideoStateChanged` event reports that there is no permission to start the video capture device.

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, the permission statuses of the audio and video capture devices are both reported in the `onPermissionError` callback.

    **Pre-call network test**

    If you need to start or stop the network connection quality test, note the following:
    
    v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> reconstructs the audio application scenarios, which can replace most of the audio application scenarios of v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />. The following table shows the correspondence of audio application scenarios in the two releases:

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />, you can call `enableLastmileTest` to start the network quality test. If you want to stop the network test, you need to call `disableLastmileTest`.

    In v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />, you can call `startLastmileProbeTest` to enable network quality testing. If you want to stop network testing, you need to call `stopLastmileProbeTest`.

### Function gaps

This section introduces functions that were supported in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" /> but are no longer supported or behave inconsistently in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />. Plans exist to support them or make them consistent in a future release, however.

    **Audio application scenarios**

    v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> reconstructs the audio application scenarios, which can replace most of the audio application scenarios of v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />. The following table shows the correspondence of audio application scenarios in the two releases:

| v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />                             | v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" />                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| AudioScenarioDefault               | AudioScenarioDefault        |
| AudioScenarioChatroomEntertainment | AudioScenarioChatroom       |
| AudioScenarioEducation             | AudioScenarioDefault        |
| AudioScenarioGameStreaming         | AudioScenarioGameStreaming  |
| AudioScenarioShowroom              | AudioScenarioDefault        |
| AudioScenarioChatroomGaming        | AudioScenarioChatroom       |
| AudioScenarioIot                   | AudioScenarioDefault        |
| AudioScenarioMeeting               | AudioScenarioMeeting        |

### Removed APIs

The v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> removes deprecated or unrecommended APIs. Alternatives to the removed API or reasons for their removal are shown as follows:

    * `virtualBackgroundSourceEnabled`: Use the return value of `enableVirtualBackground` instead.
    * `setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed`: Use the relevant API under the `IMediaPlayer` class instead.
    * `getAudioFileInfo` and `onRequestAudioFileInfo`: Use `getDuration` instead.
    * `onAudioDeviceTestVolumeIndication`：Use `onAudioVolumeIndication` instead.
    * `setLocalPublishFallbackOption` and `onLocalPublishFallbackToAudioOnly`: Rarely used in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />.
    * `enableDeepLearningDenoise`: The SDK adds deep-learning noise reduction as one of its capability in a future release instead of implementing through an API.
    * The `Channel` parameter in `takeSnapshot` and `onSnapshotTaken`: The parameter is redundant.
    * `SetDefaultMuteAllRemoteVideoStreams`: Use `autoSubscribeVideo` in the `ChannelMediaOptions` instead.
    * `SetDefaultMuteAllRemoteAudioStreams：Use` `autoSubscribeAudio` in the `ChannelMediaOptions` instead.
    * `LOCAL_VIDEO_STREAM_ERROR_SCREEN_CAPTURE_WINDOW_NOT_SUPPORTED` in `LOCAL_VIDEO_STREAM_ERROR`：Deprecated in v<Vg k="VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE" />.
    * The `replace` parameter in `startAudioMixing`: Use `publishMicrophoneTrack` in the `ChannelMediaOptions` instead.

### Naming changes

The naming changes in v<Vg k="VSDK_RELEASE" /> cause error messages in the IDE when you compile your project, and you need to update the code of your app according to each error message.

The main API and parameter name changes are as follows:

    * `adjustLoopbackRecordingSignalVolume` is changed to `adjustLoopbackRecordingVolume`.
    * `onFirstLocalAudioFrame` is changed to `onFirstLocalAudioFramePublished`.
    * The `fileSize` member in `LogConfig` is renamed to `fileSizeInKB`.
    * The `options` parameter in `joinChannel`[2/2] is changed to `mediaOptions`.
    * The `report_vad` parameter in `enableAudioVolumeIndication` is changed to `reportVad`.
