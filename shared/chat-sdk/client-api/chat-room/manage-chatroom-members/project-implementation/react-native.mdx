### Remove a member from a chat room

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `removeChatRoomMembers` to remove one or more members from a chat room. Once removed from the chat room, this member receives the `onRemoved` callback, while all the other members receive the `onMemberExited` callback. Users can join the chat room again after being removed.
The following code sample shows how to remove members from a chat room:

```typescript
List<string> members = new List<string>();
members.Add("member1");
members.Add("member2");

SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.DeleteRoomMembers(roomId, members, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
        Console.WriteLine($"DeleteRoomMembers success.");
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
        Console.WriteLine($"DeleteRoomMembers failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```

### Retrieve the chat room member list

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomMembers` to retrieve the member list of the current chat room.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room member list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomMembers(roomId, cursor, pageSize)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("get members success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get members fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Manage the chat room block list

#### Add a member to the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `blockChatRoomMembers` to add the specified member to the chat room block list. Once added to the block list, this member receives the `onRemoved` callback, while all the other members receive the `onMemberExited` callback. After being added to block list, this user cannot send or receive messages in the chat room. They can no longer join the chat room again until they are removed from the block list.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room block list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.blockChatRoomMembers(roomId, members)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("block members success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("block members fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unblockChatRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from the chat room block list.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from the chat room block list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.unblockChatRoomMembers(roomId, members)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("unblock members success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("unblock members fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Retrieve the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `fetchChatRoomBlockList` to retrieve the chat room block list.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room block list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomBlockList(roomId, pageNum, pageSize)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("block members success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("block members fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Manage the chat room mute list

#### Add a member to the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `muteChatRoomMembers` to add the specified member to the chat room mute list. Once added to the mute list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `onMuteListAdded` callback.

**Note**: The chat room owner can mute chat room admins and regular members, whereas chat room admins can only mute regular members.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room mute list:

```typescript
// duration: The mute duration. If you pass `-1`, members are muted permanently.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.muteChatRoomMembers(roomId, muteMembers, duration)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("mute members success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("mute members fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unMuteChatRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from the chat room mute list. Once removed from the mute list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `onMuteListRemoved` callback.

**Note**: The chat room owner can unmute chat room admins and regular members, whereas chat room admins can only unmute regular members.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from the chat room mute list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.unMuteChatRoomMembers(roomId, unMuteMembers)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("unMute members success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("unMute members fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Retrieve the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `fetchChatRoomMuteList` to retrieve the chat room mute list.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room mute list:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomMuteList(roomId, pageNum, pageSize)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("get mute members success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get mute members fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Manage the chat room allow list

The chat room owner and admins are added to the chat room allow list by default.

Members in the chat room allow list can send chat room messages even when the chat room owner or an admin has muted all the chat room members. However, if a member is already in the chat room mute list, adding this member to the allow list does not take effect.

#### Retrieve the allow list of the chat room

Only the chat room owner or admin can call `fetchChatRoomAllowListFromServer` to retrieve the allow list of the current chat room.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomAllowListFromServer(roomId)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("get members success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get members fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Add a member to the chat room allow list

Only the chat room owner or admin can call `addMembersToChatRoomAllowList` to add a member to the chat room allow list. The member added to the allow list, the chat room owner, and admins, except the operator, receive the `ChatRoomEventListener#onAllowListAdded` event.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.addMembersToChatRoomAllowList(roomId, members)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room allow list

Only the chat room owner or admin can call `removeMembersFromChatRoomAllowList` to remove a member from the chat room allow list. The member removed from the allow list, the chat room owner, and admins, except the operator, receive the `ChatRoomEventListener#onAllowListRemoved` event.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.removeMembersFromChatRoomAllowList(roomId, members)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Check whether the current user is in the chat room allow list

Chat room members can call `isMemberInChatRoomAllowList` to check whether they are in the chat room allow list.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.isMemberInChatRoomAllowList(roomId)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Mute and unmute all the chat room members

#### Mute all the chat room members

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `muteAllChatRoomMembers` to mute all the chat room members. Once all the members are muted, the `ChatRoomEventListener#onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged` callback is triggered and only those in the chat room allow list can send messages in the chat room.

Unlike muting a chat room member, this kind of mute does not expire automatically after a certain period and you need to call the `unMuteAllChatRoomMembers` method to unmute all members in the chat room.

The following sample code shows how to mute all the chat room members:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.muteAllChatRoomMembers(roomId)
  .then((members) => {
    console.log("success.", members);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Unmute all the chat room members

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unMuteAllChatRoomMembers` to unmute all the chat room members. Once all the members are muted, the `onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged` callback is triggered.

The following sample code shows how to unmute all the chat room members:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.unMuteAllChatRoomMembers();
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```


### Manage the chat room owner and admins

#### Transfer the chat room ownership

Only the chat room owner can call `changeOwner` to transfer the ownership to the specified chat room member. Once the ownership is transferred, the former chat room owner becomes a regular member. The new chat room owner and the chat room admins receive the `onOwnerChanged` callback.

The following code sample shows how to transfer the chat room ownership:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.changeOwner(roomId, newOwner)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("change owner success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("change owner fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Add a chat room admin

Only the chat room owner can call `addChatRoomAdmin` to add an admin. Once promoted to an admin, the new admin and the other chat room admins receive the `onAdminAdded` callback.

The following code sample shows how to add a chat room admin:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.addChatRoomAdmin(roomId, admin)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("add admin success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("add admin fail.", reason);
  });
```

#### Remove a chat room admin

Only the chat room owner can call `removeChatRoomAdmin` to remove an admin. Once demoted to a regular member, the former admin and the other chat room admins receive the `onAdminRemoved` callback.

The following code sample shows how to remove a chat room admin:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.removeChatRoomAdmin(roomId, admin)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("remove admin success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("remove admin fail.", reason);
  });
```
