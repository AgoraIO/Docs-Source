  The key features of Agora Media Gateway
---

<Vpd k="NAME" /> enables users to push content to Agora SD-RTN™ using standard streaming protocols such as RTMP and SRT. The channel host automatically publishes this streamed content to the correct channel. With <Vpd k="NAME" />, you can employ advanced transcoding capabilities on media streams for enhanced distribution.

The following figure shows the overall architecture of <Vpd k="NAME" />:

## Product features

<Vpd k="NAME" /> supports the following features:

| Feature                                    | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|---|
| Media input                                | Supports generating a streaming key through RESTful API or a local encryption algorithm, and pushes the source stream directly to Agora's gateway service. After a successful push, the media stream is automatically played in the channel for remote users. |
| Multiple media streaming formats/protocols | <ul><li>Video codec format: H.264, H.265</li> <li>Audio codec format: AAC</li> <li>Push protocol: RTMP, SRT</li> <li>Media formats: FLV, MPEG-TS</li></ul> |
| Custom transcoding parameters              | Supports enabling transcoding for media streams input into the channel. If you enable transcoding, you can set parameters such as resolution, frame rate, bitrate, and whether to enable large and small streams. |
| Restricted access area                     | When activating <Vpd k="NAME" />, you specify the access area to ensure the transmission quality of the media stream. |
| Server event notification callback         | Agora provides message notification services. After activating <Vpd k="NAME" />, you will receive event notifications.  |

## Applicable use cases

In ultra-high-definition use-cases, the main signal is generally processed by the content provider and then pushed to Agora through the RTMP protocol (suitable for low bitrates) or the SRT protocol (suitable for high bitrates). <Vpd k="NAME" /> enables you to add source streams to SD-RTN™ with low latency while ensuring high stability. Some sample use-cases for the use of <Vpd k="NAME" /> include:

| Use case | Description |
|---|---|
| Commentary from influencers/celebrities | Inject high-definition video streams into interactive channels. Multiple hosts can watch and interact in real time in different places. |
| Low-latency distribution | Distribute content to viewers faster and more reliably than with a CDN. |
| Recording and live broadcasting| The teacher records the content in advance and injects it into a live classroom. All students and teaching assistants can watch the teacher's content, and students can communicate and interact in real time with each other and and with teaching assistants. |
| 24-hour chat room | Background music is played 24 hours a day and is not interrupted when switching hosts. |
