Use this method to mute or unmute the current streaming.

### Prototype

- Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `https://api.sd-rtn.com/:region/:version/projects/:appId/rtls/ingress/online-streams/mute/:sid`

### Request parameters

**Authentication**

<Authorization/>

**Path parameters**

| Parameter   | Data type | Required/Optional | Description             |
| :---------- | :-------  |:----------------- | :---------------------- |
| `region`    | String    | Required          | Create an area for pushing the streaming key. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> supports creation of stream keys by region. Currently, the following regions are supported: <ul><li>`na`: North America</li><li>`eu`: Europe</li><li>`ap`: Asia, except mainland China</li><li>`cn`: Mainland China</li></ul><Admonition type="caution" title="Important">Make sure that: <ul><li>The `region` value is the same as for the input source stream.</li><li>The domain names for setting the `region` parameter and streaming are the same. </li><li>The `region` value is in lowercase.</li></ul></Admonition> |
| `version` | String | Required | The API version. Use `v1`. |
| `appId`     | String    | Required          | The app ID provided by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to each developer. After creating a project in <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>, you can get an app ID. The app ID is a unique identifier for a project. |
| `sid`       | String    | Required          | The streaming session ID is the unique identifier for each initiated streaming task. It can be obtained by [querying the streaming list](query-streaming-list) or receiving the payload of the [message notification callback](/media-gateway/develop/receive-notifications).|

**Headers**

| Header         | Data type | Description             |
| :------------- | :-------  |:----------------------- |
| `X-Request-ID` | String    | The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of the request. After passing in this field, the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> server will return this field in the response header. It is recommended to assign `X-Request-ID` a value. If no value is assigned, the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> server will automatically generate a UUID and pass it in. |

**Request body**

The request body consists of a JSON Object type `settings` and includes the following fields:

| Parameter     | Data type | Required/Optional | Description             |
| :------------ | :-------- |:----------------- | :---------------------- |
|`videoMuted`      | boolean    | Required          | Whether to mute the video stream:<br/><ul><li>`true`: Mute pushing the video stream.</li><li>`false`: Unmute pushing the video stream.</li></ul> |
|`audioMuted`      | boolean    | Required          | Whether to mute the audio stream:<br/><ul><li>`true`: Mute pushing the audio stream.</li><li>`false`: Unmute pushing the audio stream.</li></ul> |

### Request example

```shell
curl --request post \
  --url https://api.sd-rtn.com/:region/:version/projects/:appId/rtls/ingress/online-streams/mute/:sid \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>' \
  --header 'X-Request-ID: <string>' \
  --data '
{
  "settings": {
    "videoMuted": true,
    "audioMuted": false
  }
}'
```

### Response parameters

**Headers**

| Header         | Data type | Description             |
| :------------- | :-------  |:----------------------- |
| `X-Request-ID` | String    | The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of the request. The value is in its `X-Request-ID` header. If a request error occurs, print the value in the log to troubleshoot the problem. A `401 (Unauthorized)` response status code means that there is no such field in the response header.|

**Response body**

For details about possible response status codes, see [Response status codes](../../response-status-codes).

If the status code is not `200`, the request fails. See the `message` field in the response body for the reason for this failure.

If the status code is `200`, the request succeeds, and the response body includes the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Type   | Description        |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----------------- |
| `status`         | String | The status of this request. `success` means the request succeeds.  |

<Admonition type="info">
- The successful execution of this request only confirms that the command is sent to the gateway node handling the stream; it does not guarantee that the mute/unmute operation was successful. The operation is executed asynchronously in the background.

- Typically, the mute/unmute action takes effect within approximately one second. If the operation does not work as expected, retry the API call.

- By default, each stream starts unmuted (audio and video are published normally). Each API call applies to the current stream. If the streamer disconnects and restarts the stream, the new stream resets to the initial unmuted state.

### Response example

The following is a response example for a successful request:

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```
