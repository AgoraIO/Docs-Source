<Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some cases, users want to modify the captured audio to add voice effects, or change the voice quality before the audio is published. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides several options that enable you to apply voice effects. This page shows you how to implement these features in your channel.

## Understand the tech

With <Vpd k="SDK" /> you can implement voice modifying effects such as chat beautifier, singing beautifier, and voice changer. These are gaining popularity in social interaction and entertainment scenarios. To help you quickly integrate voice effects into your project, <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides pre-configured effects. You can choose from the following types:

    * **Preset voice beautifiers**: Chat beautifier, singing beautifier, and timbre transformation.

    * **Preset audio effects**: Voice changer, style transformation, room acoustics, and pitch correction.

    * **Preset voice conversion**: Changing the original voice to make it unrecognizable.

    * **Voice formant modification**: Changing the voice timbre by adjusting the formant ratio.

    * **Customized audio effects**: Controlling the voice pitch, equalization, and reverberation.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the code examples on this page, make sure you have completed the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) guide.

## Implement voice effects

This section shows how to use different sound beautifiers to enhance your audio experience. 

Use the following methods to set the desired vocal effects:

    *  Call the `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` method to apply effects such as chatting bel canto, singing bel canto, and timbre change.
    *  Utilize the `setAudioEffectPreset` method to configure sound effects, genre sound effects, space shaping, and other effects.
    *  Apply the `setVoiceConversionPreset` method to entirely transform the original voice.
    If the preset effects don't meet your requirements, customize vocal effects using methods such as `setLocalVoicePitch`, `setLocalVoiceEqualization`, and `setLocalVoiceReverb`.

Choose the one that best fits your requirements. To implement various voice effects in your project, take the following steps:
