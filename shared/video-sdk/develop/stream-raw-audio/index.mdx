This article introduces how to preprocess and postprocess collected raw audio data.

## Understand the tech
During the audio transmission process, we can preprocess and postprocess the collected audio data to achieve the desired playback effect.

For scenarios that require self-processing of audio data, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> provides raw data functionality. You can perform pre-processing to modify the captured audio signal before sending the data to the encoder, or you can perform post-processing to modify the received audio signal after sending the data to the decoder.

To implement processing of raw audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps.
- Set up audio frame observers.
- Register audio frame observers before joining a channel.
- Set the format of audio frames captured by each callback.
- Implement callbacks in the frame observers to process raw audio data.
- Unregister the frame observers before you leave a channel.


The following figure shows the basic process of using raw audio data:

## Prerequisites
- Before proceeding, ensure that you have implemented basic real-time audio and video functionality in your project i.e. you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.
