## Understand the tech

A typical transmission pipeline in the Agora Web SDK consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, preprocessing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and playback. In the preprocessing stage, extensions can modify the audio and video data in the pipeline to implement features such as virtual background and noise cancellation.
