Agora Chat supports logging in to the same account from up to 4 devices at the same time by default. To enable this feature or increase the number of simultaneously used devices, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

In cases of multiple device login, all logged-in devices synchronize the following information and operations:

- Messages, including online messages, offline messages, push notifications (if the third-party push service is enabled, the offline device receives it), the corresponding receipts and read status, and so on;
- Friends and group-related operations;
- Sub-area-related operations;
- Conversation-related operations.

The mutual kick strategy and automatic login security check in the single-device and multi-device login scenarios are as follows:

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed='web'>
| Single/multi-device login | Kick strategy | Automatic login security check |
|---|---|---|
| Single-device login | The newly logged-in device will kick the current device offline. | When the device supports automatic login, if you need to determine whether to kick out the earliest logged-in device currently online when the device automatically reconnects after going offline, contact support@agora.io. |
| Multi-device login | If the number of logged-in devices reaches the limit, the device that logged in the latest will kick the device that logged in the earliest offline. Agora Chat only supports kicking on the same end. | When the device supports automatic login, if you need to determine whether to kick out the earliest logged-in device currently online when the device automatically reconnects after going offline, contact support@agora.io. |

- Single-device login: The newly logged-in device will kick the current online device offline.
- Multi-device login: If the number of logged-in devices on one end reaches the upper limit, the newly logged-in device will kick the earliest logged-in device on that end offline. Chat only supports mutual kicking on the same end.

## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed='web'>
During initialization, the SDK generates a login ID to identify the device when multiple devices log in and push messages, and sends this ID to the server. The server automatically sends new messages to the user's logged-in device, monitors operations on other devices, and synchronizes multiple devices. The SDK provides the following multi-device scenario functions:

- Get the login ID list of the other logged-in devices of the current user;
- Get the list of online logged-in devices of the specified account;
- Force the specified account to log off from a single device;
- Force the specified account to log off from all devices;
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed={['react-native','ios','unity','windows']}>
- Get friend or group operations on other devices.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform={['ios','unity','windows']}>
- Get operations on other devices.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform='react-native'>
- Set the name of the login device;
- Set the platform of the login device;
- Get notified about multi-device synchronization.
</PlatformWrapper>
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform='web'>

Chat SDK generates a new unique login ID every time a user logs in and sends the ID to the server. The server automatically sends new messages to the device where the user logs in, and can automatically monitor friend or group operations on other devices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, initialize and connect the SDK to the server. See [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) for details.
