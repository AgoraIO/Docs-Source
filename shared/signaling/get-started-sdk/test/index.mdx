For each user you use in your tests:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a--token).

    In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You create
a token for each user in the channel. When you call `login` using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same
as you used to create the token.
