You can use extension fields to implement customized push settings. This page uses force push and sending silent messages as examples to explain how to implement push extensions.

## Set custom push fields

When creating a push message, you can add custom fields to the message to meet personalized business needs:

```typescript
msg.attributes = {
  // Message extension fields.
   "em_push_ext": {
        "custom": {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2"
        }
    },
};
```

The data structure of the custom field is as follows:

```json
{
    "em_push_ext": {
        "custom": {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2"
        }
    }
}
```

| Parameters              | Description                |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
|  `em_push_ext` | The fixed extension value, cannot be modified.     |
|  `custom`          | The message extension. Use the extension method to add custom fields to the push. The value is fixed. |
|  `key1`/`key2`     | Customize the specific content of the message push extension. |

## Force push

The user can set force push to ignore the recipient's DND setting when sending messages:

```typescript
// The following takes text messages as an example. The setting methods for other types of messages are the same.
msg.attributes = {
  // Whether to force push. This field is a built-in field, and the values are as follows: `true`: force push; (default) `false`: non-force push.
  em_force_notification: true,
};
```

## Send a silent message

Sending silent messages means that the sender sets the message not to be pushed when sending it. That is, when the user is offline, Chat will not push message notifications to the user's device through the FCM push service. When the user is online again, they will receive all the messages received during the offline period.

Both silent message sending and do not disturb mode pause push messages. The difference is that silent message sending is set by the sender when sending the message, while the DND mode is set by the receiver.

```typescript
// The following takes text messages as an example. The setting methods for other types of messages are the same.
msg.attributes = {
  // Whether to send a silent message. This field is a built-in field, and the values are as follows: `true`: send a silent message; (default) `false`: push the message.
  em_ignore_notification: true,
};
```
