Cloud Transcoding enhances playback by mixing audio, combining images, and transcoding them into low-bitrate streams, ensuring smoother video performance and improved fluency.",

            title: "Cross-platform compatibility",
            content: "Supports standard H.264 and VP8 encoding. When a host streams from a Native platform device while the audience watches on a Web platform, the Cloud Transcoding service can convert the host’s source stream to VP8 encoding. This ensures seamless playback and enhances the viewing experience for Web users.",

Designed specifically for real-time interactive live broadcast scenarios, Agora's <Vpd k="NAME" /> service enables you to capture the host’s audio and video source streams from a <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel on the server side and apply processing such as transcoding, mixing, and image combination. The processed streams are then published to a <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel, allowing the audience to subscribe.

By leveraging cloud-based transcoding, viewers no longer need to subscribe to multiple hosts' audio and video streams, reducing downstream bandwidth usage and optimizing client device performance.
