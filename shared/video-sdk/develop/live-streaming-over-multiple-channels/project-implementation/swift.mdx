This section shows you how to implement the following methods of multi-channel streaming:

-   [Channel media relay](#channel-media-relay)

-   [Join multiple channels](#implement-joining-multiple-channels)

Choose the method that best suits your scenario and follow the step by step procedure.

### Channel media relay

In this example, you use a single `Button` to start and stop channel media relay.

#### Implement the user interface

To enable your users to start and stop relaying to another channel, add a `Button` to the user interface.

To create this user interface, in the `ViewController` class:

1.  **Add a button to start channel media relay.**

    Add the following line along with the other declarations at the top:

    <CMCreateUI />

2.  **Configure the `channelRelayBtn` button in your interface**

    Paste the following lines inside the `initViews` function:

    <CMConfigureButtons />

You see an error in your IDE. This is because `channelRelayBtnClicked`
refers to a function that you create later.

#### Handle the system logic

In your project, declare the required variables.

1.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To store source and destination channel settings and manage channel
    relay, add the following declaration to the top of the
    `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    var destChannelName = "<#name of the destination channel#>"
    var destChannelToken = "<#access token for the destination channel#>"
    var destUid: UInt = 100 // User ID that the user uses in the destination channel.
    var sourceChannelToken = "<#access token for the source channel#>" // Generate with the channelName and uid = 0.
    var mediaRelaying: Bool = false
    ```

#### Implement channel media relay

To enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to relay channel media to a destination channel, take the following steps:

1.  **Start or stop channel media relay**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts relaying media from the source channel to the destination channel. If channel media relay is already running, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> stops it. To integrate this workflow, add the following function to the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    @objc func channelRelayBtnClicked() {
        if mediaRelaying {
            agoraEngine.stopChannelMediaRelay()
        } else {
            // Configure the source channel information.
            let srcChannelInfo: AgoraChannelMediaRelayInfo = AgoraChannelMediaRelayInfo(token: sourceChannelToken)
            srcChannelInfo.channelName = channelName
            srcChannelInfo.uid = 0
            let mediaRelayConfiguration: AgoraChannelMediaRelayConfiguration = AgoraChannelMediaRelayConfiguration()
            mediaRelayConfiguration.sourceInfo = srcChannelInfo

            // Configure the destination channel information.
            let destChannelInfo: AgoraChannelMediaRelayInfo = AgoraChannelMediaRelayInfo(token: destChannelToken)
            destChannelInfo.channelName = destChannelName
            destChannelInfo.uid = destUid
            mediaRelayConfiguration.setDestinationInfo(destChannelInfo, forChannelName: destChannelName)

            // Start relaying media streams across channels
            agoraEngine.startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay(mediaRelayConfiguration)
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Monitor the channel media relay state**

    To receive the state change notifications sent during media relay, you add a function to the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> event handler. To have your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> respond to connection and failure events,
    add the `channelMediaRelayStateDidChange` callback to the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> event handler, `extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {`:

    <CMMonitorRelayState />

3.  **Monitor channel media relay events**

    To receive notifications of important channel relay events such as network disconnection, reconnection, and users joining channels, you add a `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent` function to the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> event handler. Add the following function inside `extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {`:

    ```swift
    func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didReceive event: AgoraChannelMediaRelayEvent) {
        switch event {
            case .disconnect:
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.showMessage(title: "Channel Media Relay Event", text: "User disconnected from the server due to a poor network connection.")
                }

            case .connected:
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.showMessage(title: "Channel Media Relay Event", text: "Network reconnected")
                }

            case .joinedSourceChannel:
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.showMessage(title: "Channel Media Relay Event", text: "User joined the source channel")
                }
            default:
                break
        }
    }
    ```

### Join multiple channels

The alternate approach to multi-channel live streaming is joining multiple channels. In this section, you learn how to implement joining a
second channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

#### Implement the user interface

In this example, you use a single button to join and leave a second channel.

1.  **Add a second channel join and leave button.**

    To enable the button to be accessible to multiple classes in the `ViewController.swift` file, add the following line before `class ViewController: UIViewController {`:

    <MCCreateUI />

2.  **Configure the `secondChannelBtn` button in your interface.**

    Paste the following lines inside the `initViews` function:

    <MCConfigureButtons />

#### Handle the system logic

In your project, declare the necessary variables, and setup access to the UI elements.

1.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To join and manage a second channel, add the following declarations
    before `class ViewController: UIViewController {`:

    ```swift
    var secondChannelName = "<#name of the second channel#>"
    var secondChannelUid: UInt = 100 // Uid for the second channel
    var secondChannelToken = "<#access token for the second channel#>"
    var isSecondChannelJoined: Bool = false // Track connection state of the second channel
    ```

2.  **Enable the user to join another channel**

    1.  Add the following lines after
        `agoraEngine = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(with: config, delegate: self)`
        in the `initializeAgoraEngine` function:

        ```swift
        secondChannelBtn.isEnabled = false
        ```

    2.  Enable this button when a user joins the initial channel. Add
        the following line to the `joinChannel` function after
        `joined = true`:

        ```swift
        secondChannelBtn.isEnabled = true
        ```

#### Implement joining multiple channels

To add multi-channel functionality to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take
the following steps:

1.  **Join a second channel**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a second channel. If the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is already connected to a second channel, it leaves the channel. To do this, add the following method to the `ViewController` class.

    <MCJoinSecondChannel />

2.  **Receive callbacks from the second channel**

    The `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` implements channel callbacks. For the second channel, you create another instance of `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` and register it with the <Vg k="ENGINE"/> when you join the channel using `joinChannelEx`. To create an instance named `secondChannelDelegate`, do the following:

    1.  In the `ViewController`, add the following line along with the
        other declarations at the top:

        ```swift
        var secondChannelDelegate: SecondChannelDelegate = SecondChannelDelegate()
        ```

    2.  In your `ViewController.swift` file, add the following
        `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` event handler class:

        <MCSecondChannelDelegate />

3.  **Make variables visible to both classes**

    In this example, you need both `ViewController` and `SecondChannelDelegate` to be able to set `remoteView` as its `UIView` when calling `setupRemoteVideo` or `setupRemoteVideoEx`, you also need to see the second connection instance. To do this, remove the `var remoteView: UIView!` declaration from `ViewController` and add the following before `class ViewController: UIViewController {`:

    <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
        ```swift
        var rtcSecondConnection: AgoraRtcConnection!
        var remoteView: UIView!
        ```
    </PlatformWrapper>
    <PlatformWrapper platform="macos">
        ```swift
        var rtcSecondConnection: AgoraRtcConnection!
        var remoteView: NSView!
        ```
    </PlatformWrapper>
