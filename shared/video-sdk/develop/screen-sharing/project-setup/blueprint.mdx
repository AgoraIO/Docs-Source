### Android and iOS 

Since Apple does not support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream. You use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the main process.

Refer to the [iOS Screen Sharing Guide](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Unreal-RTC-SDK/blob/main/Agora-Unreal-SDK-CPP-Example/IOS%20ScreenShare%20Guide.md) to create an Extension for your <Vpl k="NAME" /> project.

### Windows and macOS

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> currently supports the following <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> solutions for macOS and Windows platforms:

    - Share a specified screen or part of a specified screen using the `displayId`.
    - Share a specified window or part of a specified window using the `windowId`.

The basic API call sequence is shown in the figure below:
