## Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `fetchConversationsFromServerWithPage` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). If there is no message in conversations, the SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are created. Each retrieved conversation contains one last historical message. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```java
// pageNum: The current page number, starting from 1.
// pageSize: The number of conversations to get per page. The value range is [1,20].
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchConversationsFromServerWithPage(pageSize, pageNum)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("test:success:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.warn("test:error:", error);
  });
```

For users that do not support `fetchConversationsFromServerWithPage`, call `fetchAllConversations` to retrieve the conversations from the server. By default, the SDK retrieves the last ten conversations in the past seven days, and each conversation contains one last historical message. To adjust the time limit or the number of conversations retrieved, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages by pagination from the server. You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them.

If you have implemented Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Send 500 offline messages/conversation by default;
- Chat Group: Send 200 offline messages/conversation by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

```typescript
// Specify the conversation ID.
const convId = "convId";
// Specify the conversation type. For details, see descriptions in  ChatConversationType.
const convType = ChatConversationType.PeerChat;
// Specify the maximum count of the retrieved messages.
const pageSize = 10;
// Specify the message ID from which to retrieve the historical messages.
const startMsgId = "";
// Specify the message search direction.
const direction = ChatSearchDirection.UP;
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchHistoryMessages(convId, chatType, {
    pageSize,
    startMsgId,
    direction,
  })
  .then((messages) => {
    console.log("get message success: ", messages);
  })
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimestamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerWithMsgIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```typescript
// Delete messages by message ID
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeMessagesFromServerWithMsgIds(convId, convType, msgIds)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("test:success:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.warn("test:error:", error);
  });
// Delete messages by timestamp
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeMessagesFromServerWithTimestamp(
    convId,
    convType,
    timestamp
  )
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("test:success:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.warn("test:error:", error);
  });
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server

Call `removeConversationFromServer` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```typescript
// convId: conversation ID
// convType: conversation type.
// isDeleteMessage: Whether to delete historical messages from the server with the conversation.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeConversationFromServer(convId, convType, isDeleteMessage)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("remove conversions success");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("remove conversions fail.", reason);
  });
```
