To optimize the user experience when dealing with a large number of push notifications, Chat SDK provides fine-grained settings for push notifications and do not disturb mode at the app and conversation levels.

## Push notification settings

| Parameter      | Description    | App   | One-to-one and group chats   |
| :------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
|  `All`  | Receive push notifications for all offline messages. | ✓ | ✓ |
|  `MentionOnly`  | Receive push notifications only for mentions. < br />This parameter is recommended for group chats. To mention one or more users, pass `"em_at_list": [ "user1", "user2" ... ]` to the `ext` field when creating a message. To mention all, pass `"em_at_list": "all"` to this field. | ✓ | ✓ |
|  `NONE`    | Do not receive push notifications for offline messages. | ✓ | ✓ |

The push notification setting at the conversation level takes precedence over the setting at the app level. For conversations where the push notification setting is not configured, the app setting is used by default.

For example, suppose the push notifications for the app are set to `MentionOnly` and the push notifications for a given conversation are set to `ALL`. A user will receive all push notifications from that conversation, but for all other conversations, they will only receive push notifications for messages that mention them.

After you have completed SDK initialization and successfully logged into the app, you can enable offline push for the app and various types of conversation, and turn off push by setting the Do Not Disturb mode.

You can specify the DND time period and duration at the app level, and Chat will not send offline push notifications during these two periods. If both the DND time and DND duration are set, the DND mode will take effect for the sum of the two.

The following table describes the DND time settings:

| Quiet time parameters      |   Description    | App   | Single and group chat conversations   |
| :--------| :----- | :------------ | :------------ |
| `silentModeStartTime & silentModeEndTime` | The time period for turning on the DND mode, in the `H:MH:M` format, using the 24-hour system and accurate to the minute. For example, `8:30`-`10:0`. The range of hours and minutes in the start time and end time is `[0,23]` and `[0,59]`, respectively. The DND mode is set in the following way: <ul><li>After the start time and end time are set, the DND mode is triggered every day. For example, if the time period is set to `8:0`-`10:0`, the DND mode is effective from 8:00 to 10:00 every day. If you set the start time to `8:0` and the end time to `12:0` at 11:00, the DND mode is effective from 11:00 to 12:00 on the same day, and from 8:00 to 12:00 every day thereafter. </li><li> If the start time and end time are the same, the DND mode is effective all day. However, if it is set to `0:0`-`0:0`, the DND mode will be turned off. </li><li>If the end time is earlier than the start time, the DND mode will take effect from the start time of each day to the end time of the next day. For example, if the start time is `10:0` and the end time is `8:0`, the DND mode will take effect from 10:00 on that day to 8:00 on the next day. </li><li>The DND mode can only be enabled during a specified time period each day. Multiple DND time periods are not supported. The new setting will override the previous setting. </li><li>If both this parameter and `silentModeDuration` are set, the DND mode will be in effect during both time periods on the day. For example, if `silentModeDuration` is set to `8:0`-`10:0` and `silentModeDuration` is set to 240 minutes (4 hours) at 8:00 am, the app will be in DND mode from 8:00-12:00 on that day and from 8:00-10:00 every day thereafter. </li></ul> | ✓ | ✗ |
|  `silentModeDuration`  | The DND duration, in minutes. The value range of the DND duration is `[0,10080]`, where `0` means the parameter is invalid and `10080` means the DND mode lasts for 7 days. < br /> Unlike the setting of the DND time period, which takes effect every day, this parameter is valid once. It takes effect immediately after setting. For example, if you set the app-level `silentModeDuration` to 240 minutes (4 hours) at 8:00 am, the app will be in DND mode from 8:00 to 12:00 on the same day. < br /> If both this parameter and `silentModeStartTime & silentModeEndTime` are set, the DND mode will be effective during both time periods on the same day. For example, if the app-level `silentModeStartTime & silentModeEndTime` is set to 8:00-10:00 at 8:00 am and the DND duration is set to 240 minutes (4 hours), the app will be in DND mode from 8:00-12:00 now and from 8:00-10:00 every day thereafter.     | ✓      | ✓ |

If you need to push messages to specific users during the DND period or effective time, set [Force push](configure-push-notifications).

For the app and all conversations in the app, the DND setting takes precedence over the push notification setting. For example, suppose a user specifies a DND time period at the app level and sets push notifications to `ALL`. The app enters the DND mode during the specified time period, and the user will not receive any push notifications.

Alternatively, suppose a conversation is assigned a DND time period. The app does not have any DND settings and its push notifications are set to `ALL`. During the specified DND time period, the user will not receive any push notifications from this conversation, while push notifications from all other conversations will remain unchanged.

## Set up push notifications for the app

Call `setSilentModeForAll` to set app-level push notifications. Configure push notifications and the DND mode by specifying the `AgoraChatSilentModeParam` field, as shown in the following code example:

```objective-c
// Set the push notification method to `MentionOnly`.
AgoraChatSilentModeParam *param = [[AgoraChatSilentModeParam alloc]initWithParamType:AgoraChatSilentModeParamTypeRemindType];
    param.remindType = AgoraChatPushRemindTypeMentionOnly;
// Set up offline push notifications for the app.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager setSilentModeForAll:param completion:^(AgoraChatSilentModeResult *aResult, AgoraChatError *aError) {
            if (aError) {
                NSLog(@"setSilentModeForAll error---%@",aError.errorDescription);
            }
        }];
// Set the offline push do not disturb timer to 15 minutes.
AgoraChatSilentModeParam *param = [[AgoraChatSilentModeParam alloc]initWithParamType:AgoraChatSilentModeParamTypeDuration];
    param.silentModeDuration = 15;
//Set the do not disturb time period for offline push to 8:30 to 15:00.
AgoraChatSilentModeParam *param = [[AgoraChatSilentModeParam alloc]initWithParamType:AgoraChatSilentModeParamTypeInterval];
    param.silentModeStartTime = [[AgoraChatSilentModeTime alloc]initWithHours:8 minutes:30];
    param.silentModeEndTime = [[AgoraChatSilentModeTime alloc]initWithHours:15 minutes:0];
```

## Get the push notification settings of the app

Call `getSilentModeForAllWithCompletion` to get the app-level push notification settings, as shown in the following code example:

```objective-c
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager getSilentModeForAllWithCompletion:^(AgoraChatSilentModeResult *aResult, AgoraChatError *aError) {
            if (!aError) {
                // Get the push notification method settings of the app.
                AgoraChatPushRemindType remindType = aResult.remindType;
                // Get the Unix timestamp of the app's offline push Do Not Disturb expiration.
                NSTimeInterval ex = aResult.expireTimestamp;
                // Get the start time of the app's offline push do not disturb time period.
                AgoraChatSilentModeTime *startTime = aResult.silentModeStartTime;
                // Get the end time of the offline push do not disturb time period of the app.
                AgoraChatSilentModeTime *endTime = aResult.silentModeEndTime;
            }else{
                NSLog(@"getSilentModeForAll error---%@",aError.errorDescription);
            }
        }];
```

## Set push notifications for a single conversation

Call `setSilentModeForConversation` to set push notifications for a specified conversation. Configure push notifications and the DND mode by specifying the `SilentModeParam` field, as shown in the following example:

```objective-c
// Set the push notification method to `MentionOnly`.
AgoraChatSilentModeParam *param = [[AgoraChatSilentModeParam alloc]initWithParamType:AgoraChatSilentModeParamTypeRemindType];
    param.remindType = AgoraChatPushRemindTypeMentionOnly;

// Set the offline push do not disturb timer to 15 minutes.
AgoraChatSilentModeParam *param = [[AgoraChatSilentModeParam alloc]initWithParamType:AgoraChatSilentModeParamTypeDuration];
    param.silentModeDuration = 15;
// Set the offline push do not disturb mode for the conversation. Currently, it does not support setting the do not disturb time period for the conversation.
AgoraChatConversationType conversationType = AgoraChatConversationTypeGroupChat;
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager setSilentModeForConversation:@"conversationId" conversationType:conversationType params:param completion:^(AgoraChatSilentModeResult *aResult, AgoraChatError *aError) {
        if (aError) {
                NSLog(@"setSilentModeForConversation error---%@",aError.errorDescription);
         }
     }];
```
## Get push notification settings for a single conversation
You can call getSilentModeForConversation to get the push notification settings for a specific conversation, as shown in the following code example:
```objective-c
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager getSilentModeForConversation:@"conversationId" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat completion:^(AgoraChatSilentModeResult * _Nullable aResult, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {
    }];
```

## Get push notification settings for multiple conversations

You can get push notification settings for up to 20 conversations in each call. If a conversation uses app settings or its push notification settings have expired, the returned dictionary does not contain that conversation. Call  `getSilentModeForConversations` to get the push notification settings for multiple conversations, as shown in the following  example:

```objective-c
AgoraChatConversation* conv1 = [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId1"];
NSArray *conversations = @[conv1];
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager getSilentModeForConversations:conversations completion:^(NSDictionary<NSString*,AgoraChatSilentModeResult*>*aResult, AgoraChatError *aError) {
            if (aError) {
                NSLog(@"getSilentModeForConversations error---%@",aError.errorDescription);
            }
        }];
```

## Clear push notification settings for a single conversation

Call `clearRemindTypeForConversation` to clear the push notification settings for a specified conversation. After clearing, this conversation will use the app's settings by default:

```objective-c
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].pushManager clearRemindTypeForConversation:@"" conversationType:conversationType completion:^(AgoraChatSilentModeResult *aResult, AgoraChatError *aError) {
            if (aError) {
                NSLog(@"clearRemindTypeForConversation error---%@",aError.errorDescription);
            }
    }];
```
