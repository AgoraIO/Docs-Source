You use <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You can also use <Vg k="SIG" /> to
enhance the user experience for <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" />.

This page shows you how to easily integrate pub-sub messaging into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg
k="MESS_SDK" />. For information about stream channels where users communicate using topics in a channel, see [Stream
channels](/en/signaling/develop/stream-channel).

## Understand the tech

Pub-sub is the simplest form of messaging. Your <Vpl k="MESS" /> creates a channel when a user subscribes to it. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for the channel events which contain the messages
users publish to it.

You use an authentication token to authenticate a user with <Vg k="MESS" /> and join a channel. Each token is
bound to a single user UID. This means that one concurrent user only may login from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

To create a pub-sub session for <Vg k="MESS" /> , implement the following steps in your
<Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from Token Generator. To understand how to create an authentication
server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow).
To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:
