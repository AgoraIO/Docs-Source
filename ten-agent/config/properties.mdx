Properties control the behavior and settings of each extension, such as API keys, model parameters, and feature toggles. This guide shows you how to configure extension properties in the <Vpd k="NAME" /> playground.

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

- Complete the [Agent quickstart](../get-started/quickstart)
- Verify the playground is running at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## Configure extension properties

1. Open the playground at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

2. Select a graph type such as Voice Agent or Realtime Agent

3. Click the settings button next to the graph selector to open property configuration

4. Choose an extension node from the dropdown list

5. Configure the properties for your selected extension:
    - Text values: Click the input field and enter your value
    - Boolean values: Toggle the switch
    - API keys: Enter your credentials in the secure field

6. Click **Save Changes** to apply your configuration

    The system displays a confirmation message when properties are successfully updated.

## Add hidden properties

Some extensions properties are not visible by default. These hidden properties have no initial values but can be configured when needed.

To add a hidden property:

1. Click **Add** in the property configuration panel

2. Select a property from the available options

3. Click **Add** to include it in your configuration

4. Set the property value

5. Click **Save Changes**

    The system displays a confirmation message when the property is successfully added to the extension.
