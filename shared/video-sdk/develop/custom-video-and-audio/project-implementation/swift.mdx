### Implement a custom video source

In this section, you create the basic framework required to push video frames from a custom source. Depending on the source type, you add your own code that converts the source data to `VideoFrame` data. To create this basic framework, take the following steps:

1. **Add a raw video file to the project**

    In this example, you use a video file as the source of your custom video data. Download a sample video file in `*.mp4` format to your Xcode project.

1. **Enable publishing the custom video**

    When a user presses **Join**, you set the external video source to `true` before joining a channel. To do this, add the following line to the `joinChannel()` method in the `ViewController` class after `option.channelProfile = .liveBroadcasting`:

    ```swift
    agoraEngine.setExternalVideoSource(true, useTexture: true, sourceType: AgoraExternalVideoSourceType(rawValue: 1)!)
    ```

1. **Setup a video renderer for custom video**

    <Vg k="VSDK" /> does not support rendering video frames captured in the push mode. You need to implement a custom video renderer using methods from outside the SDK.

    ```swift
    // Initializes localVideo
    var localVideo = CustomVideoSourcePreview(frame: CGRect.zero)

    // Defines the CustomVideoSourcePreview class
    class CustomVideoSourcePreview : UIView {

        private var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
        func insertCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer) {
            self.previewLayer?.removeFromSuperlayer()

            previewLayer.frame = bounds
            layer.insertSublayer(previewLayer, below: layer.sublayers?.first)
            self.previewLayer = previewLayer
        }

        override func layoutSublayers(of layer: CALayer) {
            super.layoutSublayers(of: layer)
            previewLayer?.frame = bounds
        }
    }
    ```

1. **Push the video frames**

    To play the custom video when a user joins the channel, you open the video file when the user clicks **Join**. You add your custom logic to process the data into a `VideoFrame`, and push the `VideoFrame` to the channel. To do this, add the following lines after `joined = true` in the `joinChannel()` method:

    ```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "<#videofile-name#>", withExtension: "<#extension#>")
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url!) else { return }

    // Add code here to convert `Data` to VideoFrame object
    // ...

    agoraEngine.pushExternalVideoFrame(AgoraVideoFrame()) // replace AgoraVideoFrame() with your processed VideoFrame object
    ```

### Implement a custom audio source

To push audio from a custom source to a channel, do the following:

1. **Define variables to manage and push the audio stream**

    In `ViewController.swift`, add the following declarations to the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    // Audio file parameters
    var SAMPLE_RATE: Int = 44100
    var NUM_OF_CHANNELS: Int = 1
    ```

1. **Add a raw audio file to the project**

    In this example, you use an audio file as the source of your custom audio data. Download a sample audio file in `*.wav` format to your Xcode project.

1. **Enable custom audio track publishing**

    When a user presses **Join**, you set the `ChannelMediaOptions` to disable the microphone audio track and enable the custom audio track. You also enable custom audio local playback and set the external audio source. To do this, add the following lines to the `joinChannel()` method in the `ViewController` class after the `if self.userRole == .broadcaster {` block:

    ```swift
    option.channelProfile = .communication
    option.publishCameraTrack = false
    option.publishMicrophoneTrack = false
    option.publishCustomAudioTrack = true
    agoraEngine.setExternalAudioSource(true, sampleRate: SAMPLE_RATE, channels: NUM_OF_CHANNELS, sourceNumber: 1, localPlayback: true, publish: true)
    ```

1.  **Open the audio file and push data**

    To play the audio file when a user joins the channel, you open the audio file and start pushing the data. To do this, add the following lines after `joined = true` in the `joinChannel()` method:

    ```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "<#audio-filename-without-extension#>", withExtension: "<#extension#>")
    guard var data = try? Data(contentsOf: url!) else { return }
    let dataPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(mutating: &data)
    agoraEngine.pushExternalAudioFrameRawData(dataPointer, samples: 0, sourceId: 0, timestamp: 0)
    ```

    Replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` and `<extension>` with appropriate values. For example, for a file named `audio.wav` replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` with `audio` and `<extension>` with `wav`.
