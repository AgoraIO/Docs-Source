### Sample project

Agora provides a Web sample project [ExtensionDemo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web/tree/main/ExtensionDemo) for developing audio and video extensions.

### API reference

The classes used to create and encapsulate filters are:

- [`VideoExtension`](#videoextension) - Extension initialization.
- [`VideoProcessor`](#videoprocessor) - Video processing.

#### AudioExtension

Extension initialization is implemented through the `Extension` class. You need to implement the `createProcessor` method of the `Extension` class:

- **createProcessor**

    Creates a `VideoProcessor` instance. The SDK calls this method when the app client calls `extension.createProcessor`. You need to return the created `VideoProcessor` instance in this method.

    ```
    abstract class Extension<T extends BaseProcessor> {
        createProcessor(): T;
    }
    ```


### VideoProcessor

To implement video processing, you need to implement the following steps:

1. Receive video: Through the `onTrack` method of the` VideoProcessor` class.
2. Process video: You need to implement this module on your own.
3. Output processed video: Through the `output` method of the `VideoProcessor` class.

- **onTrack**

    Reports that video data from the previous node is received.

    ```
    abstract onTrack?(track: MediaStreamTrack, context: IProcessorContext): void;
    ```

    **Parameters**

    - `track`: The previous `MediaStreamTrack`. `MediaStreamTrack` is an interface provided by Web API. For details, see [MediaStreamTrack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack ).

    - `context`: The context of the current video processing pipeline.

- **output**

    Outputs the processed video data.

    ```
    output(track: MediaStreamTrack, context: IProcessorContext): void;
    ```

    **Parameters**

    - `track`: The processed `MediaStreamTrack`.

    - `context`: The context of the current video processing pipeline.

### Auxiliary APIs

This section describes the auxiliary APIs for developing an audio extension.

-    [VideoProcessor](#videoprocessor)
-    [Ticker](#ticker)
-    [Logger](#logger)
-    [Reporter](#reporter)


#### VideoProcessor



- **name**

    The name of the` Processor`.

    ```
    name: string;
    ```



- **enabled**

    Whether the` Processor` is enabled.

    ```
    enabled :boolean;
    ```



- **ID**

    The identifier of the` Processor`.

    ```
    public readonly ID:string;
    ```

- **kind**

    The type of the ` Processor`, which is categorized as video or audio.
    ```
    public get Kind():'video' | 'audio';
    ```

- **context**

    This property allows the `Processor` to request and recapture the original media stream.

    ```
    protected context?: IProcessorContext;
    ```


- **onPiped**

    Reports that a `LocalVideoTrack` connects to the current media processing pipeline.

    **Note**: This callback is not triggered if only `Processor`s are connected``. For example: The app client calls `processorA.pipe(processorB)`.

    ```
    abstract onPiped?(context: IProcessorContext): void;
    ```

- **onUnpiped**

    Reports that the `Processor` disconnects from the media processing pipeline.

    ```
    abstract onUnPiped?(): void;
    ```


- **onEnableChange**

    Reports that the `Processor` is enabled or disabled.

    ```
    abstract onEnableChange?(enabled: boolean): void | Promise<void>;
    ```



- **inputTrack**

    Video received by the extension from the previous `Processor` or `LocalVideoTrack`.

    ```
    protected inputTrack?:MediaStreamTrack;
    ```


- **outputTrack**

    Video output by the `Processor`. Calling the `output` method automatically sets the `outputTrack` property.

    ```
    protected outputTrack?:MediaStreamTrack;
    ```

#### Ticker

- **constructor**

    The constructor of the ` Ticker` class.

    ```typescript
    public constructor(type:"Timer" | "RAF" | "Oscillator", interval: number):Ticker;
    ```

    **Parameters**

    - `type`: The following types are supported:
       - `Timer`: Using `setTimeout` as the internal ` timer` of the extension.
       - (Recommended) `RAF`: Using `requestAnimationFrame` as the internal timer of the extension. In most cases, this type of `Ticker` has the best rendering performance.
       - `Oscillator`: Using `Web Audio's ``OscillatorNode` as the internal timer of the extension. This type of `Ticker` keeps running when the browser page is not being viewed.

    - `interval`: The `interval `between two recurring callbacks.  The `Ticker` tries its best to execute at this interval, but might not be 100% accurate.

- **Ticker.add**

    Adds a timer task.

    ```typescript
    public add(fn: Function): void;
    ```



- **Ticker.remove**

    Removes the added timer task.

    ```typescript
    public remove():void;
    ```

- **Ticker.start**

    Starts the timer.

    ```typescript
    public start():void;
    ```

- **Ticker.stop**

    Stops the timer.

    ```typescript
    public stop():void;
    ```



#### Logger

Provides four levels of logs.

If the app client chooses to upload the logs when calling `AgoraRTC.registerExtension`, the status of the extension that implements the `Logger` class is updated.

```
interface IExtensionLogger {
    debug(...args: any): void;
    error(...args: any): void;
    info(...args: any): void;
    warning(...args: any): void;
}
```


#### Reporter

- **Reporter.reportApiInvoke**

    ```typescript
    public reportApiInvoke<T>(params: ReportApiInvokeParams): AgoraApiExecutor<T>;
    ```

    Reports events related to API calls to the SDK.

    The definitions of `ReportApiInvokeParams` and `AgoraApiExecutor` are as follows:

    ```typescript
    interface ReportApiInvokeParams {
        // The API name
        name: string;
        // Parameters or options related to the API
        options: any;
        // Whether to report the result of the API call
        reportResult?: boolean;
        // How long is counted as timeout for the API call
        timeout?: number;
    }
    interface AgoraApiExecutor<T> {
        // The API call succeeds
        onSuccess: (result: T) => void;
        // The API call fails
        onError: (err: Error) => void;
    }
    ```
