This article contains detailed help for the <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful APIs.

## Authentication
The RESTful APIs require basic HTTP authentication. You need to set the `Authorization` parameter in every HTTP request header. For how to get the value for Authorization, see [RESTful API authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).


## Understand the tech

You can implement different types of <Vg k="MPUSH" /> depending on the live streaming scenario requires transcoded or non-transcoded streaming. Transcoding is essentially an encoding and decoding function used to mix multiple audio and video streams into one audio and video stream, which can guarantee the synchronization of multiple hosts' live streams seen by the audience. Therefore, generally speaking, in the case of multiple-hosts live streaming, you need to enable transcoding when pushing streams to CDN; in the case of single-host live streaming, only one media stream is pushed to the CDN, so you do not need to enable transcoding.
Processing the media streams and pushing it to the CDN creates a <Vg k="MPUSH" /> task (shown as "Converter" in the rest of the article) in the Agora channel. You can control a Converter through the following methods:

- `Create`: Create a Converter for your project, and set up the relevant configuration of transcoded or non-transcoded streaming. The media stream in the channel is processed by the Converter according to this configuration and then pushed to the CDN.
- `Delete`: Destroy the specified Converter. The user's media stream in this channel will no longer be processed by the Converter or pushed to the CDN after you destroy the Converter.
- `Update`: Update the specified Converter configuration.
- `Get`: Get the streaming status of the specified Converter.

## Create: Create a Converter

### HTTP request

```html
POST https://api.agora.io/{region}/v1/projects/{appId}/rtmp-converters
```

#### Path parameter

- `appId`: (Required) String. The **App ID** provided by Agora. You can get an App ID after creating a project in the Agora console. An App ID is the unique identification of a project.
- `region`: (Required) String. The region that the Converter was created in. Agora supports the creation of Converters in different regions. Currently, four regions are supported:
  - `cn`: China Mainland
  - `ap`: Asia, excluding Mainland China
  - `na`: North America
  - `eu`: Europe

<div class="alert note"><li>Please ensure that the region you set is the same region as where your CDN originates is located.</li><li>Please make sure the value of <code>region</code> is lowercase.</li></div>

#### Query parameters

`regionHintIp`: (Optional) String. The IP address of the CDN source station. It must be a valid IPv4 address. This parameter can help ensure the stability of the RTMP stream.

```html
POST https://api.agora.io/{region}/v1/projects/{appId}/rtmp-converters?regionHintIp={regionHintIp}
```

#### Request header

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

- `Authorization`: The value of this field must refer to the [Authentication instructions](../reference/restful-authentication).

- `X-Request-ID`: The UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that identifies this **request**. Agora server generates a UUID to pass in and returns `X-Request-ID` field in the response header.

  > Agora recommends that you assign a value to `X-Request-ID`. Agora server returns an `X-Custom-Request-ID` field in the response header for trouble shooting.

#### <a name="createbody"></a>Request body

You can implement different types of <Vg k="MPUSH" /> depending on the live streaming scenario requires transcoded or non-transcoded streaming. Generally speaking, in the case of multiple-hosts live streaming, you need to enable transcoding when using <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful APIs; in the case of single-host live streaming, only one media stream is pushed to the CDN, so you do not need to enable transcoding. For details, see [<Vg k="MPUSH" /> Features](../overview/product-overview#features).

**<Vg k="MPUSH" /> with transcoding**

The request Body is the `converter` field of JSON Object type. The field structure is shown in the following figure:

Multiple converters with an empty name field can be created under a project. Two converters cannot have the same name, however; you will receive a response status code of <code>409</code> (Conflict) if you try to create a converter with the same name as one that already exists under that project. <div class="alert note">To avoid repeatedly creating multiple Converters and repetitively pushing streams, please use the <code>name</code> field to manage the Converters under the specified project. Agora recommends that you combine "channel name (<code>rtcChannel</code>)" and "Converter feature" to assign a value to the <code>name</code>.

## List: Query the Converters of all or specified channels under a project

### HTTP request

- Query all Converters under a project: `GET https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/rtmp-converters`

- Query the Converter of a specified channel under a project: `GET https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/channels/{cname}/rtmp-converters`

#### Path parameter

- `appId`: (Required) String. The App ID provided by Agora. You can get an App ID after creating a project in the Agora console. An App ID is the unique identification of a project.

- `cname`: (Required) String. The Agora channel name. This is the channel to which the stream processed by the Converter belongs. The maximum length of the string is 64 characters, and the following character sets (89 characters in total) are supported:
 - All lowercase English letters (a-z)
 - All uppercase English letters (A-Z)
 - Numbers 0-9The space character
 - "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "\<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "|", "~", ","

#### Query Parameters

`cursor`: (Optional) String. Cursor for paging query Converters. The value must be greater than or equal to 0.

> - You do not need to set the cursor when you initiate a `List` request for the first time. After the request is successful, the list of Converters on the first page return.
> - Each request returns information about a maximum of 500 Converters.. If the number of Converters under the project exceeds 500, get the `cursor` from the response body, and pass the `cursor` in the URL of the next request. Until the value of the `cursor` field in the response body is `0`, it means that all Converters under the project or the specified channel have been queried.

The HTTP URL using Query Parameters is as follows:

- Query all Converters under a project: `GET https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/rtmp-converters?cursor={cursor}`

- Query the Converter of a specified channel under a project: `GET https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{appId}/channels/{cname}/rtmp-converters?cursor={cursor}`

#### Request header

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

- `Authorization`: The value of this field must refer to the [Authentication instructions](../reference/restful-authentication).

- `X-Request-ID`: The UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that identifies this **request**. Agora server generates a UUID to pass in and returns `X-Request-ID` field in the response header.

  > Agora recommends that you assign a value to `X-Request-ID`. Agora server returns an `X-Custom-Request-ID` field in the response header for troubleshooting.

### HTTP response

All possible response status codes. See [Status codes](#status-codes) for details.

#### Response header

`X-Request-ID`: The UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that identifies this request. This value is the same as the X-Request-ID in the header of this request. If there is an error in the request, print out the value in the log to troubleshoot the problem.

> If the response status code of this request is not 2XX, this field may be missing from the response header.

#### Response body

If the status code is 2XX, the request is successful. The field structure is shown in the following figure:

## API call rate limits

The Agora server limits the call rate for the <Vg k="MPUSH" /> API by method. When a call rate exceeds its limit, the status code `429 (Too Many Requests)` is returned. If you need a higher call rate, please contact technical support.

| API      | Rate limits                                                  |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Create` | In a project, the rate limit for the rate of creating a Converter is 50 times per second. |
| `Delete` | In a project, the rate limit for the converter destruction is 50 times per second. |
| `Update` | In a project, the rate limit for the rate of updating a specified Converter is 2 times per second. |
| `Get` | In a project, the rate limit for the rate of getting the status of a specified Converter is 50 times per second. |

## Consideration

This section summarizes the most important considerations for using the <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful API.

| Note        | Influence level |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| Please make sure that the Agora channel scene is live.       | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†           |
| If you need only one Converter in a channel, you must use the `name` parameter. See the `name` parameter explanation for details. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†           |
| Please ensure that the region you set is the same region as where your CDN originates is located. For details, see the description of `region`. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…           |
| If a Converter is automatically destroyed due to service failures (or other reasons), Agora recommends that you create a new Converter. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…           |
| After creating a Converter, if the CDN side pulls the stream abnormally, Agora recommends that you `Delete` that Converter and create a new Converter. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…           |
| Please make sure that the `sequence` value is incremented when you `Update` the same Converter multiple times. Please refer to the `sequence` parameter explanation for details. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…           |
| When there is an error in the request, please be sure to print out the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` field values of the response header in the log to facilitate troubleshooting. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†           |
