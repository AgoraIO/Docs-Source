### Implement the user interface

To enable the user to play sound and voice effects and modify the audio route, add the following elements to the user interface:

* A button to start and stop audio mixing
* A button to play the sound effect
* A button to apply various voice effects
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="macos">
* A switch to turn the speakerphone on or off
</PlatformWrapper>

To create this user interface, in the `ViewController` class:

1. **Add the UI elements you need**

    Add the following declarations at the top of the class.

    <CreateUI />

1. **Configure the UI elements in your interface**

    Paste the following lines inside the `initViews` function:

    <ConfigureButtons />


### Handle the system logic

This section describes the steps required to use the relevant libraries, declare the necessary variables, and set up access to the UI elements.

**Define variables to manage audio effects, and access the UI elements**

    Add the following declarations to the top of the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    let soundEffectId: Int32 = 1 // Unique identifier for the sound effect file
    let soundEffectFilePath = "https://www.soundjay.com/human/applause-01.mp3" // URL or path to the sound effect
    var soundEffectStatus: UInt = 0
    var voiceEffectIndex: UInt = 0
    var audioPlaying: Bool = false // Manage the audio mixing state
    let audioFilePath = "https://www.kozco.com/tech/organfinale.mp3" // URL or path to the audio mixing file
    ```

### Implement sound and voice effects

To add sound and voice effect to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. **Enable the user to start and stop audio mixing**

    Add the following function to the `ViewController` class:

    <StartStopMixing />

1. **Set the audio scenario**

    For applications where special audio performance is required, you should set a suitable audio scenario. For example, to set your app for a gaming scenario, in `ViewController`, add the following lines after `func initializeAgoraEngine() {
            let config = AgoraRtcEngineConfig()`:

    ```swift
    // Specify the audio scenario
    config.audioScenario = .gameStreaming
    ```

1. **Set the audio profile**

    <ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
    For different audio quality requirements, you should set a suitable audio profile.  For example, to enable your gamers to fully appreciate the audio effect, in the `joinChannel` function, add the following lines before `agoraEngine.joinChannel(...)`:    
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
    For different audio quality requirements, you should set a suitable audio profile.  For example, to enable your gamers to fully appreciate the audio effect, in the `setupLocalVideo` function, add the following lines after `agoraEngine.enableVideo()`:
    </ProductWrapper>   

    ```swift
    // Specify the audio profile
    agoraEngine.setAudioProfile(.musicHighQualityStereo)
    ```

1. **Pre-load sound effects**

    <ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
    To set up playing sound effects, get the `agoraEngine` and pre-load the sound effects. In the `joinChannel` function, add the following lines:        
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
    To set up playing sound effects, get the `agoraEngine` and pre-load the sound effects. In the `setupLocalVideo` function, add the following lines:    
    </ProductWrapper>

    ```swift
    // Pre-load sound effects to improve performance
    agoraEngine.preloadEffect(soundEffectId, filePath: soundEffectFilePath)
    ```

1. **Play, pause, or resume playing the sound effect**

    The first time a user presses the  button, the sound effect is played. The next time, the effect is paused. To enable this functionality, add the following function to the `ViewController` class:

    <PausePlayResume />

1. **Update the UI after the effect finishes playing**

    When <Vpd k="SDK" /> has finished playing the sound effect, the `onAudioEffectFinished` event is fired. To handle this event, in `ViewController`, add the following function inside `extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` along with the existing event handlers:

    <UpdateUI />

1. **Apply various voice effects**

    When a user presses the button, apply a new voice effect and change the text on the button to describe the effect. To do this, add the following function to the `ViewController` class:

    <ApplyVoiceEffects />

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="macos">
1. **Set the audio route**

    When the user toggles the switch, enable or disable the speakerphone. To do this, add the following function to the `ViewController` class:

    <SetAudioRoute />

</PlatformWrapper>
