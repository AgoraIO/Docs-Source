### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getServerConversations` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

<div class="alert note">Do not use mixed upper-case.</div>

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is `20`.
// cursor: The cursor position for starting to get data. If you pass in an empty string (''), the SDK retrieves conversations from the latest active one.
connection.getServerConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''}).then((res)=>{
    console.log(res)
})
```

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

Refer to the following code sample:

```javascript
connection.getHistoryMessages({
  targetId: 'targetId', // The user ID of the peer user for one-to-one chat or group ID for group chat.
  chatType: 'groupChat', // The chat type: `singleChat` for one-to-one chat or `groupChat` for group chat.
  pageSize: 20, // The number of messages to retrieve per page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is 20.
  searchDirection: 'down', // The message search direction: `up` means to retrieve messages in the descending order of the message timestamp and `down` means to retrieve messages in the ascending order of the message timestamp.
  searchOptions: {
    from: 'message sender userID', // The user ID of the message sender. This parameter is used only for group chat.
    msgTypes: ['txt'], // An array of message types for query. If no value is passed in, all types of message will be queried.
    startTime: new Date('2023,11,9').getTime(), // The start timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
    endTime: new Date('2023,11,10').getTime(), // The end timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
  },
});
```

### Pin a conversation

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```javascript
connection.pinConversation({conversationId:'conversationId', conversationType: 'singleChat', isPinned: true})
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50]。
// cursor：The cursor position to start getting data. If an empty string ('') is passed, the SDK will start querying from the latest pinned session.
connection.getServerPinnedConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''})
```


### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeHistoryMessages` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 20 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```javascript
// Delete messages by timestamp
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', beforeTimeStamp: Date.now()})
// Delete messages by message ID
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', messageIds: ['messageId']})
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteConversation` to delete conversations and related messages unidirectionally from the server. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```javascript
let options = {
  // conversation ID: The conversation ID is the user ID of the peer user for one-to-one chat and the group ID for group chat.
  channel: "channel",
  // Conversation type: (Default) `singleChat`: one-to-one chat; `groupChat`: group chat.
  chatType: "singleChat",
  // Whether to delete historical messages from the server with the conversation.
  deleteRoam: true,
};
WebIM.conn
  .deleteConversation(options)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    // Deletion failure.
  });
```
### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addConversationMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. You can tag up to 20 conversations at a time.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `getServerConversations` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `ConversationItem#marks` method.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding marks to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in the conversation.</Admonition>

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.addConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('addConversationMark success')
})
```

To create customized tags, you need to do the following:
  
  ```javascript
  const MarkMap = new Map();
  MarkMap.set(0, 'IMPORTANT');
  MarkMap.set(1, 'NORMAL');
  MarkMap.set(2, 'STAR');
  ```

### Remove tag of a conversation

To remove tag of a conversation, call `removeConversationMark`. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side conversation tags.

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.removeConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('removeConversationMark success')
})
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `getServerConversationsByFilter` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```javascript
const options = {
  pageSize: 10,
  cursor: '',
  filter: {
    mark: 0
  }
}
conn.getServerConversationsByFilter().then((res) => {
  console.log('getServerConversationsByFilter success', res)
})
```
