1. **Setup a React Native environment for <Vpd k="NAME"/> project**

    In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx react-native init ProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript
    ```

    npx creates a new boilerplate project in the `ProjectName` folder.

    For Android projects, enable the project to use Android SDK. In the `android` folder of your project, set the `sdk.dir` in the `local.properties` file. For example:


    ```bash
    sdk.dir=C:\\PATH\\TO\\ANDROID\\SDK
    ```

1. **Test the setup**

    Launch your Android or iOS simulator and run your project by executing the following command:

    1. Run `npx react-native start` in the root of your project to start Metro.
    1. Open another terminal in the root of your project and run `npx react-native run-android` to start the Android app, or run `npx react-native run-ios` to start the iOS app.

    You see your new app running in your Android or iOS simulator. You can also run your project on a physical Android or iOS device. For detailed instructions, see [Running on device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).

1. **Integrate and configure <Vg k="VSDK" />**

    To integrate  <Vg k="VSDK" /> on React Native 0.60.0 or later:
    1. Navigate to the root folder of your project in the terminal and integrate with either:
        - npm

            ```bash
            npm i --save react-native-agora
            ```

        - yarn

            ```bash
            // Install yarn.
            npm install -g yarn
            // Download the Agora React Native SDK using yarn.
            yarn add react-native-agora
            ```

            Do not link native modules manually, React Native 0.60.0 and later support [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/main/docs/autolinking.md).

    1. If your target platform is iOS, use CocoaPods to install <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

        ```bash
        npx pod-install
        ```

    1. <Vg k="VSDK" /> uses Swift in native modules, your project must support compiling Swift. To create `File.swift`:

        1. In Xcode, open `ios/ProjectName.xcworkspace`.
        1. Click **File > New > File, select iOS > Swift File**, then click **Next > Create** .
