Take the following steps to set up your project:

1. Refer to the appropriate Quickstart Guide to integrate the Web SDK (v4.10.0 or later) and implement the basic real-time communication functions in your project.

2. Integrate the [virtual background extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-extension-virtual-background) into your project via npm:

   1. To install the virtual background extension, run the following command :

      ```bash
      npm install agora-extension-virtual-background
      ```

   2. To import the virtual background extension, use any of the following methods:

      Method one: Add the following code to the JavaScript file:

      ```typescript
      import VirtualBackgroundExtension from "agora-extension-virtual-background";
      ```

      Method two: Use the Script tag in the HTML file. Once imported, the `VirtualBackgroundExtension` object can be used directly in JavaScript files.

      ```html
      <script src="./agora-extension-virtual-background.js"></script>
      ```

3. Dynamically load the Wasm dependency: The virtual background extension depends on a Wasm file. Find the Wasm file in `node_modules/agora-extension-virtual-background/wasms`. You need to publish the Wasm file to a CDN or static resource server. You need to pass in the URL of the Wasm file when calling `processor.init` in subsequent steps. The extension dynamically loads the Wasm file.

    If the host URL of the Wasm file is not the same as that of the web application, enable the CORS policy. Do not put the Wasm file in an HTTP service, because loading HTTP resources in the HTTPS domain is blocked by browsers' security policy.
