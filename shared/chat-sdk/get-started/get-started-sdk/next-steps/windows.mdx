1. Generate a user token  
For demonstration purposes, Agora Chat uses temporary tokens generated from Agora Console for authentication in this guide. In a production context, the best practice is for you to deploy your own token server, use your own [App Key](enable#get-the-information-of-the-agora-chat-project) to generate a token, and retrieve the token on the client side to log in to the Agora Chat service. To see how to implement a server that generates and serves tokens on request, see [Generate a User Token](../Develop/Authentication).

2. Avoid blocked callbacks  
Each callback of an Agora Chat client instance is triggered from internal threads. Therefore, to avoid blocking internal threads, Agora recommends that you execute your operations in other threads when callbacks are triggered.
