Designed specifically for real-time interactive live broadcast scenarios, Agora's <Vpd k="NAME" /> service enables you to obtain audio and video source streams from hosts in RTC channels on the server side and perform processing such as transcoding, mixing, and image combination. The processed streams are then published to Agora RTC channels for audience subscription.

The service supports subscriptions to audio and video streams with different picture quality levels, reducing downstream bandwidth pressure and client device performance consumption. For multi-bitrate business scenarios, Agora provides scenario-based solutions that simplify the integration threshold for implementing multi-bitrate capabilities on the audience side.
