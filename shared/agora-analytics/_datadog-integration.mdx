[Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/) is an observability service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. It enables you to visualize and monitor metrics, setup custom alerts, create dashboards and more. To analyze <Vg k="COMPANY" /> data with your other integrations, you can push <Vg k="AA" /> usage, quality, and performance data directly to your Datadog account.

This page shows you how to setup DataDog integration with <Vg k="AA" />.

    You can only use Datadog with <Vg k="AA" /> when the Datadog Integration is enabled in your Datadog package.

4. Update the Datadog configuration:
