## Implement an audio filter extension

This section describes the APIs required for implementing an audio filter extension.




### Encapsulate into an extension





#### Sample code




## Package the audio filter extension


After encapsulating the filter into an extension, you need to register and package it into a `.aar` or `.so` file, and submit it together with a file that contains the extension name, vendor name and filter name to Agora.




## Sample project

Agora provides an Android sample project [agora-simple-filter](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/tree/main/Android/APIExample/agora-simple-filter) for developing audio and video filter extensions.
