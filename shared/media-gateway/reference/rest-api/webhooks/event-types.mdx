#### 3 `live_stream_aborted`

The gateway has received an RTMP or SRT stream but terminated it for some reason. This event may be sent individually or between `live_stream_connected` and `live_stream_disconnected` events.

**Payload example**:

```json
{
    "sid": "55df7402-8778-11ee-92ed-07ec2e86c928",
    "region": "na",
    "domain": "rtls-ingress-prod-na.agoramdn.com",
    "streamKey": "7B***Qbs",
    "rtcInfo": {
        "channel": "123",
        "uid": "1234"
    },
    "beginAt": "2023-11-21T02:27:31Z",
    "errorCode": 100,
    "reason": "invalid"
}
```

The payload contains the following fields:

| Field       | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sid`       | String    | The unique ID of each streaming session. |
| `region`    | String    | The server area that has received the pushed stream. |
| `domain`    | String    | The domain used for streaming. |
| `streamKey` | String    | The used streaming key. |
| `rtcInfo`   | Object    | RTC information: <ul><li>`channel`: The channel name. When the `channel` bound to the stream key is "", this field stores the specific random value used for this stream.</li><li>`uid`: The host UID. Supports integer and string data types. When the `uid` bound to the stream key is "" or "0", this field stores the specific random value used for this stream.</li></ul> |
| `beginAt`   | String    | The start time of the streaming in the `RFC3339` format. |
| `errorCode` | Number    | The stream termination error code. |
| `reason`    | String    | The error message. |

The possible values for the `errorCode` are:

| Value | Description | Recommended actions |
|------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| `1` | Illegal `streamKey`. For example, `channelName` is empty or contains illegal characters. | Check the `streamKey` format,  especially for locally generated ones. |
| `2` | Invalid `streamKey` (expired or deleted) | Create a new `streamKey` and try again. |
| `3` | No permission to use this `streamKey`. For example, the customer-defined domain name and `streamKey` under the associated app ID do not match. | Check whether the `streamKey` matches the domain name used for the push.|
| `4` | Number of concurrent streams exceeds the limit. | Wait and retry. |
| `5` | Conflict detected, for example, pushing to the same channel and at the same. | If the streams are not being pushed at the same time, try again 5-10 seconds later. |
| `6` | The stream attribute exceeds the limit (currently applies to bitrate only). | Check the streaming software configuration and lower the target bitrate. |
| `7` | Streaming without any audio or video data for more than 10 seconds | Check whether the last push exited abnormally, and then try again. |
| `8` | Failed to join channel | The `reason` field will provide the specific error reason, for example: `"connect to rtc failed, reason:$N"`. Refer to the API documentation for details. |
| `9` | Disconnected from the main network. Specific reasons need to be investigated by contacting technical support. | Try again several times. If you still have problems, [contact technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) to confirm whether the app certificate provided during activation is valid. |
| `10` | Unknown  internal service error. Specific reasons need to be investigated by contacting technical support. | Try again a few times. If you still have problems, [contact technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). |

#### 4 `live_profile_updated`

Stream properties have been updated. For example, the first audio or video frame has been received or the audio or video profile has changed.

| `region`    | String    | The server area that has received the pushed stream. |
| `streamKey` | String    | The used streaming key. |
| `rtcInfo`   | Object    | RTC information: <ul><li>`channel`: The channel name. When the `channel` bound to the stream key is "", this field stores the specific random value used for this stream.</li><li>`uid`: The host UID. Supports integer and string data types. When the `uid` bound to the stream key is "" or "0", this field stores the specific random value used for this stream.</li></ul> |
| `videoProfile`     | Object    | Video properties. Not applicable for audio-only streams.<ul><li>`codec`: Video codec format, such as `"H.264"`, `"H.265"`, `"VP8"`, `"VP9"`, `"AV1"`, and so on. </li><li>`width`: Video width. </li><li> `height`: Video height. </li><li> `gop`: GOP length in ms, Number type. To prevent frequent callbacks, GOP is calculated as an average value once per minute and rounded to 1000 ms. For example, when the actual calculated value is in the range of 1500-2499, it is rounded to 2000 ms. The minimum value is 1000 ms. </li></ul>|
