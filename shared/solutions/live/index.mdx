The <Vg k="SOL_LIVE" /> solution demonstrates how to create richer and more enjoyable interactions between audience members and hosts in the following scenarios:

* **Single-host live streaming**: Users join a live room as audience to watch the live stream, send messages, and give gifts to the host.
* **Host PK battles** : PK battles are friendly competitions between hosts. A host invites the host of another live room to engage in audio or video connection for interactive communication. Audience members in both live rooms are able to watch the interaction between the hosts simultaneously and vote, send gifts, or give other feedback, based on their performances. 
* **Viewer-host audio connection**: Users engage in real-time audio and video interactions with the host. Other users in the room watch the live stream.
