Before you begin, ensure the following:

- You have implemented the <Vpd k="NAME" /> [REST quickstart](../get-started/quickstart).
- Your app integrates <Vg k="VSDK" /> v4.5.1 or later and includes the video [quickstart](/realtime-communication/get-started/get-started-sdk) implementation.
- You have enabled <Vg k="SIG" /> in the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and completed [Signaling quickstart](/signaling/get-started/sdk-quickstart) for basic messaging.
- You maintain active and authenticated RTC and <Vg k="SIG" /> instances that persist beyond the component's lifecycle. The toolkit does not manage the initialization, lifecycle, or authentication of RTC or <Vg k="SIG" />.
