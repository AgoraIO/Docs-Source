This section introduces how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project.

### Chrome browser

The Web SDK supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Chrome 58 and above with or without using a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> plugin.

#### Screen sharing without using a plug-in

Simply call `createScreenVideoTrack` directly to create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track.

This method requires Chrome 74 or above. If the software version you are using does not meet this requirement, you will have to use the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> plug-in to share your screen.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      // Configure screen sharing encoding parameters, see API documentation for details
      encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
      // Set the video transmission optimization policy to Clear Priority or Smooth Priority
      optimizationMode: "detail"
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

#### Use <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> plug-in

1. Install the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chrome <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> plugin](http://download.agora.io/sdk/release/chrome-extension.zip).
1. Get the `extensionId` of the plugin.
1. Create the track filling in the previously obtained `extensionId`.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      extensionId: 'minllpmhdgpndnkomcoccfekfegnlikg',
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

#### Share audio

The Web SDK supports simultaneous <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> and locally-played background sounds on Windows and macOS platforms with the Chrome browser (version 74 and above).

When calling the `createScreenVideoTrack` method, set the `withAudio` parameter to **enable**.

Once set up this way, the `createScreenVideoTrack` method will return a list containing the following:
    - Video track object for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
    - Audio track object for local background sound playback.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
    }, "enable").then(([screenVideoTrack, screenAudioTrack])=> {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

##### Additional notes

- After using this method, it is also necessary for the end user to check **Share Audio** on the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> popup box for it to take effect.
- If you choose to share a single app window, the audio cannot be shared.

### Edge browser

The Web SDK supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Edge 80 and above on the Windows 10+ platform.

Just call `createScreenVideoTrack` to create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track:

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      // Configure the screen sharing encoding parameters here, refer to the API documentation for details
      encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

### Firefox browser

The Web SDK supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Firefox 56 and above. For Firefox, you need to specify the type of <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> by setting `screenSourceType`.

The choices of `screenSourceType` are as follows:
    - **screen**: Share the entire monitor screen.
    - **application**: Share all windows of an application (Firefox does not support this mode on Windows platform).
    - **window**: Share a window of an application.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      screenSourceType: 'screen' // 'screen', 'application', 'window'
    }).then(localScreenTrack => { /** ... **/ });
    ```

### Safari browser

The Web SDK supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Safari 13 and above on the macOS platform.

You only have to call `createScreenVideoTrack` to create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track:

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      // Configure the screen sharing encoding parameters here, refer to the API documentation for details
      encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

#### Additional notes

When <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Safari, by default the entire monitor screen is shared, and you cannot choose what content to share.

### Electron

The selection interface for Electron <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> needs to be drawn by yourself. But for quick integration, we provide a default selection interface.

If you use Electron v17.x or above, add the following code to the main process to ensure that you can obtain the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> source:

    ``` javascript
    const {  ipcMain, desktopCapturer } = require("electron");

    ipcMain.handle("DESKTOP_CAPTURER_GET_SOURCES", (event, opts) => desktopCapturer.getSources(opts));
    ```

#### Default interface

If you choose to use the default interface, there is no difference between using <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> under Electron and the web. Just call `createScreenVideoTrack` directly:

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

When called, the SDK provides its own default interface for end-users to select a screen or window to share, as shown in the following figure:

    ![Electron Screen Share Default Interface](/images/video-sdk/tmp_screen-sharing-web-electron-default-interface.png)

#### Custom interface

If you need to customize the selection interface, refer to the following steps:

    1. Call the `AgoraRTC.getElectronScreenSources` method provided by the SDK to get information about the screens that can be shared. `sources` is a list of `source` objects that contain information about the sharing source and `sourceId`. Its `source` properties are as follows:

        ![Electron Screen Share Custom Interface Source Properties](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-web-electron-custom-interface-source-properties.png)

        - **`id`**: i.e. `sourceId`.
        - **`name`**: The name of the screen source.
        - **`thumbnail`**: Snapshot of screen source.

        ``` javascript
        AgoraRTC.getElectronScreenSources().then(sources => {
          console.log(sources);
        })
        ```

    1. Based on the attributes of `source`, a selection interface is drawn in HTML and CSS to allow the user to select the screen source to be shared. The corresponding relationship between the properties of `source` and the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> selection interface is as follows:

        ![Electron Screen Share Custom Interface Thumbnail Name Relationship](/images/video-sdk/tmp_screen-sharing-web-electron-custom-interface-thumbnail-name.jpg)

    1. Get the `sourceId` selected by the user.

    1. Call the `createScreenVideoTrack` method and fill in `sourceId` with `electronScreenSourceId` to create the corresponding screen share stream.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      // Fill in the sourceId selected by the user
      electronScreenSourceIdï¼š sourceId,
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

##### Additional notes

- The `getElectronScreenSources` method is a wrapper around `desktopCapturer.getSources` provided by Electron, see [desktopCapturer](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/desktop-capturer) for details.
- Passing in a non-Electron `sourceId` will be ignored.

### Share screen and start video simultaneously

Because an `AgoraRTCClient` object can only send one video track, if you want to share the screen and turn on camera video capture at the same time on one sender, you need to create two `AgoraRTCClient`s, one to send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track and the other to send the camera track.

    ``` javascript
    async function startScreenCall() {
      const screenClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });
      await screenClient.join("<APP_ID", "<CHANNEL>", "<TOKEN>");

      const screenTrack = await AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack();
      await screenClient.publish(screenTrack);

      return screenClient;
    }

    async function startVideoCall() {
      const videoClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });
      await videoClient.join("<APP_ID", "<CHANNEL>", "<TOKEN>");

      const videoTrack = await AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack();
      await videoClient.publish(videoTrack);

      return videoClient;
    }

    Promise.all([startScreenCall(), startVideoCall()]).then(() => { /** ... **/ });
    ```

Subscribing yourself will incur additional charges, as shown in the figure:

    ![Electron Screen Share Subscribing Yourself Additional Charges](/images/video-sdk/tmp_screen-sharing-web-electron-subscribing-yourself-additional-charges.jpg)

    <Vg k="COMPANY" /> suggests that, to avoid double billing, the `uid` returned by each Client after successfully joining a channel should be stored in the list. Each time a `user-published` event is monitored, it first determines if the track is a local track, and if so, does not subscribe.

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- An `AgoraRTCClient` object can only send one video track.
- The user ID of the user responsible for publishing <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> should not be fixed at the same value, otherwise sharing streams with the same user ID may cause mutual kicks in some scenarios.
- During <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, the **client of the local stream should not subscribe to the local <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track**, otherwise it will increase the billing.
- When <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on the Windows platform, sharing the QQ chat window will cause a black screen.
