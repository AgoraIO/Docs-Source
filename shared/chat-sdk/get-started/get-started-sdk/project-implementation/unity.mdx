If the sample project runs properly, the following user interface appears:

In the user interface, perform the following operations to test the project:

1. Sign up  
Fill in the username in the `user id` box and password in the `password` box, and click **Sign up** to register an account. In this example, register two accounts (`local_user` and `remote_user`) to enable sending and receiving messages.

2. Log in  
After signing up the accounts, fill in the username in the `user id` box and password in the `password` box, and click **Sign in** to log in to the app. In this example, log in as `local_user`.

3. Send a message
Fill in the username of the receiver (`remote_user`) in the `single chat id` box and type in the message ("hello world") to send in the `message content` box, and click **Send** to send the message.

4. Sign out  
Click **Sign out** to log out of the app.

5. Receive the message  
After signing out as `local_user`, log in as `remote_user` and receive the message ("hello world") sent in step 3.

You can check the log to see all the operations from this example, as shown in the following figure:
