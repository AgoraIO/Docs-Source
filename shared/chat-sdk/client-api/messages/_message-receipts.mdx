The Chat SDK provides the message receipt feature that allows the user, after sending a message, to know whether the message is delivered or read. Also, the Chat SDK supports the conversation read receipt that allows the message sender to know whether the conversation is read.

- Message delivery receipt: Available only to one-to-one chats.
- Message read receipt: Available to both one-to-one chats and group chats.
- Conversation read receipt: Available only to one-to-one chats.
