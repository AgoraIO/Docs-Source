### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `GetConversationsFromServerWithPage` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). Each retrieved conversation contains one last historical message. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `LoadAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```csharp
FetchServerMessagesOption option = new FetchServerMessagesOption();
   option.IsSave = false;
     option.Direction = MessageSearchDirection.UP;
     option.From = "user";
     option.MsgTypes = new List<MessageBodyType>();
     option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyType.TXT);
     option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyTypeTime = 1695720454000;
     option.EndTime = 1695720554000;

     SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy(conversationId, type, cursor, pageSize, option, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
             onSuccess: (result) = >
             {
             } ,
             onError: (code, desc) = >
             {
             }
     ) ) ;
```

For users that do not support `GetConversationsFromServerWithPage`, call `GetConversationsFromServer` to retrieve all the conversations from the server. By default, the SDK retrieves the last ten conversations in the past seven days, and each conversation contains one last historical message. To adjust the time limit or the number of conversations retrieved, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can use these methods to retrieve historical messages from the server:
    - By pagination
    - For a time range

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them.

If you have implemented Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Send 500 offline messages/conversation by default;
- Chat Group: Send 200 offline messages/conversation by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

#### Retrieve historical messages by pagination

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServer(conversationId, type, startId, pageSize, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
  // Fetching historical messages succeeds.
  // `result` is in the format of CursorResult<Message>.
  onSuccess: (result) => {
  },
  // Fetching historical messages fails.
  onError:(code, desc) => {
  }
));
```

#### Retrieve historical messages for a time range

Using `FetchServerMessagesOption` to configure the time range parameters, the `FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy` method can retrieve historical messages of a conversation from the server for a specific range of time.

If you have implemented Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can call the same client API to take use of this feature. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores up to 200 messages per chat group. You can store extra messages on your app server by using a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

```csharp
FetchServerMessagesOption option = new FetchServerMessagesOption();
option.IsSave = false;
option.Direction = MessageSearchDirection.UP;
option.From = "user";
option.MsgTypes = new List<MessageBodyType>();
option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyType.TXT);
option.MsgTypes.Add(MessageBodyType.VIDEO);
option.StartTime = 1695720454000;
option.EndTime = 1695720554000;

SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy(conversationId, type, cursor, pageSize, option, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
    onSuccess: (result) =>
    {

    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {

    }
));
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.PinConversation(convId, isPinned, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {

    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {

    }
));
```


### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

The Limit parameter specifies the number of conversations each API call can return, from a range of 1-50. Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```csharp
int limit = 10;
string cursor = "";
bool pinOnly = true; // `false`: Get the list of all conversations; `true`: Get the list of only pinned conversations.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor(pinOnly, cursor, limit, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Conversation>>(
   onSuccess: (result) =>
   {
       // Traverse the obtained conversation list
       foreach (var conv in result.Data)
       {

       }
       // The cursor for the next query
       string nextCursor = result.Cursor;
   },
   onError: (code, desc) =>
   {

   }
));
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `RemoveMessagesFromServer` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, time, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, msgList, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server

Call `DeleteConversationFromServer` to delete conversations and their historical messages from the server. After the conversations are deleted from the server, you and other users can no longer get them from the server. If the historical messages are deleted with the conversations, all users can no longer get the messages from the server.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversationFromServer(conversationId, conversationType, isDeleteServerMessages, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```
