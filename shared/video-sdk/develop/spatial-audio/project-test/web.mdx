3. On your development device, update `appID`, `channel` and `token` with your values in `main.js`.

4. Start the dev server

    Execute the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Use the Url displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in your browser.

6. Connect your binaural audio playback device to your development machine. Speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app. You hear the audio through your audio playback device.

7. Press **Update Remote User Position** and speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app again. Note the change in audio quality. You feel that the remote user has moved away from you.

8. **Test spatial audio effect for media player**

    To test spatial audio effect for audio file playback, use the following code in your project:

    1. Inject a `SpatialAudioProcessor` into the audio track of a local audio file. 

        ```javascript
        async function localPlayerStart() {
            const processor = spatialAudioExtension.createProcessor();
            
            // Create an audio track from a source file
            const track = await AgoraRTC.createBufferSourceAudioTrack({
                source: "./resources/barn-beat-01.mp3",
            });

            // Inject the processor and play the track
            track.startProcessAudioBuffer({loop: false});
            track.pipe(processor).pipe(track.processorDestination);
            track.play();
        };
        ```

    1. Update the spatial position for the local audio player.

        ```javascript
        // Update the position for the audio player
        const mockLocalPlayerNewPosition = {
            position: [1, 1, 1],
            forward: [1, 0, 0],
        };
        processor.updatePlayerPositionInfo(mockLocalPlayerNewPosition);
        ```
