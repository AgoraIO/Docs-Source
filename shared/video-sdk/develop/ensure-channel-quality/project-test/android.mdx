3. **Configure the project**

    In `agora-manager/res/raw/config.json`, Replace:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `channelName` - with the name of a channel you want to join.
    * `serverUrl` - with the address of your token server or `rtcToken` with a valid temporary token for `channelName`.

1.  **Start the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**

    1. In Android Studio, connect a physical Android device to your development machine.
    
    1. Click **Run** to start the app.

        A moment later you see the project installed on your device. If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

    1. From the main screen of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, choose **<Vpd k="NAME" />** from the dropdown and then select **Call quality best practice**.

1. **Initialization best practice**

    When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> initializes the <Vg k="ENGINE" />, it does the following:

    * Sets the log file location, size, and logging level according to your preference.
    * Enables the dual-stream mode.
    * Sets the audio profile.
    * Sets the video profile.
    * Starts a network probe test.
    
    You see the result of the network probe test displayed in the network status icon.

1. **Run the echo test**

    1. Press **Start Echo Test**. You see the local camera feed. 
    
    1. Speak into the device microphone. You hear the recorded audio after a short delay. 
    
        This test confirms that the user's hardware is working properly.

    1. Press **Stop Echo Test** to end the test.

1. **Join a channel**

    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
    Select an option and click **Join** to start a session. When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="interactive-live-streaming">
    Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.
    </ProductWrapper>

1. **Monitor network health**

    You see the network status indicator updated periodically based on the result of the `onNetworkQuality` callback.

1. **View connection statistics**

    After joining a channel, you receive toast messages informing you of some selected call statistics, including: 

    * The number of users in the channel
    * Packet loss rate
    * Remote video state changes 

1. **Test the dual steam functionality**

    Tap on the remote video in the small frame. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> moves the video to the larger frame and switches the video quality to high. Tap on the remote video in the larger frame. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> moves the video back to the smaller frame and switches back to the low quality stream.

1. **View remote video statistics**

    Tap on the remote video in the small frame. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> moves the video to the larger frame and overlays the video with some selected stats for that video.
