This quickstart uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to package the project and `webpack-dev-server` to run your project.

To build and run your project, take the following steps:

1. In the `package.json` file, add `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, and `webpack-dev-server` to the `dependencies` field, and the `build` and `start:dev` commands to the `scripts` field.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "web",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "",
     "main": "index.js",
     "scripts": {
       "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
       "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
       "start:dev": "webpack serve --open --config webpack.config.js"
     },
     "keywords": [],
     "author": "",
     "license": "ISC",
     "dependencies": {
       "agora-chat": "latest",
       "agora-rtc-sdk-ng": "^4.6.3"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "webpack": "^5.50.0",
       "webpack-cli": "^4.8.0",
       "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.2"
     }
   }
   ```

2. To configure webpack, copy the following code into a new file called `webpack.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');
   
   module.exports = {
       entry: './index.js',
       mode: 'production',
       output: {
           filename: 'bundle.js',
           path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
       },
       devServer: {
           compress: true,
           port: 9000,
           https: true
       }
   };
   ```

   The project directory now has the following structure:

   ```text
    agora_quickstart
    ├─ index.html
    ├─ index.js
    ├─ package.json
    └─ webpack.config.js
   ```

3. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. To build and run the project using webpack, run the following commands:

   ```shell
   # Use webpack to package the project
   npm run build
   
   # Use webpack-dev-server to run the project
   npm run start:dev
   ```
