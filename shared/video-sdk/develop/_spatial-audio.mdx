<Vg k="SPATIAL" />  brings theater-like effects to <Vpd k="NAME" />, making it seem as if the sound originates from all around the user. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides spatial audio effects that give users an immersive audio experience in scenarios such as e-sports competitions, and online conferences.

You can configure the following spatial audio effects:

* **Spatial audio effects for users**:

    By setting the local and remote user's spatial positions, you create an environment that enables users to experience changes in the distance, position, and orientation of other users in real time. This includes:

    - Audio range: Enable users in the same group and within the range to hear each other.

    - Voice blur: Enable users to hear sounds outside of the selected range and distance, or sounds of specific objects, as blurred whispers.

    - Air attenuation: Create a more natural and realistic audio experience, making it easier for people to have natural conversations. The audio engine models how sound behaves as it travels through the air and adjusts the volume based on the distance of the audio source from the listener.

    - Local sound source playback: Customize the background sound and other audio effects.

* **Spatial audio effects for media player**:

   Update the spatial position of the media player to add a sense of space to media resources such as background sounds and musical accompaniment. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides local cartesian coordinate system calculation solution for the media player. This solution calculates the relative positions of the local user and the media player through <Vpd k="SDK" />. You update the spatial coordinates of the local user and the media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the media player.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

* Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.
<Prerequisites />

* To ensure a true spatial experience, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends using an audio device that supports true binaural playback.


## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to implement spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/> you created previously.

<ProjectSetup />

## Add spatial audio to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement spatial audio into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="SPATIAL" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
