Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In `main.dart` update the values for `appId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Fill in the same `channel` name you used to generate the token.

1. Connect a target device to your development computer.

1. Open Terminal and execute the following command in the project folder to run the sample project:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

3. Launch the App, grant microphone and camera permissions. If you set the user role to host, you see yourself in the local view.

1. On a second target device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.  Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel and test the following use-cases:

    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video window; the audience can see the host in the remote video window and hear the host.

    On an Android device, the app UI appears similar to the following:
