### Implement the user interface

To implement the user interface, create a button for the user to **Join** or **Leave** the channel.

To create this UI, in `ViewController`, replace the contents of the file with the following:

<CreateUI />

### Handle the system logic

When your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> launches, ensure that the permissions necessary to insert <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> feature into the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> are granted. If the permissions are not granted, use the built-in iOS feature to request them; if they are granted, return `true`.

1.  **Import <Vpd k="SDK" />**

    In `ViewController`, add the following line after the last `import` statement:

    ```swift
    import AgoraRtcKit
    ```

    If Xcode does not recognize this import, click *File* > *Packages* > *Reset Package Caches*.
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
2.  **Handle hardware permissions on the device**

    In `ViewController`, add the following lines after the `buttonAction(sender: UIButton!)` function:

    ```swift
    func checkForPermissions() async -> Bool {
        let hasPermissions = await self.avAuthorization(mediaType: .audio)
        return hasPermissions
    }

    func avAuthorization(mediaType: AVMediaType) async -> Bool {
        let mediaAuthorizationStatus = AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus(for: mediaType)
        switch mediaAuthorizationStatus {
        case .denied, .restricted: return false
        case .authorized: return true
        case .notDetermined:
            return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
                AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: mediaType) { granted in
                    continuation.resume(returning: granted)
                }
            }
        @unknown default: return false
        }
    }
    ```
    3.  **Show status updates to your users**

    In `ViewController`, add the following method to the `ViewController` class:

    <ShowMessage />
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="macos">

2.  **Show status updates to your users**

    In `ViewController`, add the following method to the `ViewController` class:

    <ShowMessage />
</PlatformWrapper>

### Implement the <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> logic

When a user opens this <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />. When the user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins or leaves a channel.

The following figure shows the call sequence for implementing <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />.

![voice call logic ios](/images/voice-sdk/voice-call-logic-ios.svg)

To implement this logic, take the following steps:

1.  **Declare the variables that you use to integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    Add the following lines to the top of the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    // The main entry point for Video SDK
    var agoraEngine: AgoraRtcEngineKit!
    // By default, set the current user role to broadcaster to both send and receive streams.
    var userRole: AgoraClientRole = .broadcaster

    // Update with the App ID of your project generated on Agora Console.
    let appID = "<#Your app ID#>"
    // Update with the temporary token generated in Agora Console.
    var token = "<#Your temp access token#>"
    // Update with the channel name you used to generate the token in Agora Console.
    var channelName = "<#Your channel name#>"
    ```

2.  **Initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />**

    To implement <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />, you use <Vpd k="SDK" /> to create an <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance. In `ViewController`, add the following lines after the `leaveChannel()` function:

    ```swift
    func initializeAgoraEngine() {
        let config = AgoraRtcEngineConfig()
        // Pass in your App ID here.
        config.appId = appID
        // Use AgoraRtcEngineDelegate for the following delegate parameter.
        agoraEngine = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(with: config, delegate: self)
    }
    ```

    Each `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object supports one profile only. If you want to switch to another profile, call `destroy` to release the current `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object and then create a new one by calling `sharedEngine(with: <AgoraRtcEngineConfig>, delegate: <AgoraRtcEngineDelegate?>)` again.

    You see a compilation error. Worry not, you fix this now by coding `ViewController` to delegate `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate`.

3.  **Receive notification when a remote user joins the channel**

    In `ViewController`, add the following lines after the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {
        // Callback called when a new host joins the channel
        func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didJoinedOfUid uid: UInt, elapsed: Int) {

        }
    }
    ```

    The compilation error disappears. Yay.

4.  **Join and leave a channel**

    To give a user rights to stream audio to a channel, you assign the `.broadcaster` role.

    In `ViewController`, replace the existing `joinChannel()` and `leaveChannel()` functions with the following:

    ```swift
    func joinChannel() {
        if await !self.checkForPermissions() {
            showMessage(title: "Error", text: "Permissions were not granted")
            return
        }

        let option = AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions()

        // Set the client role option as broadcaster or audience.
        if self.userRole == .broadcaster {
            option.clientRoleType = .broadcaster
        } else {
            option.clientRoleType = .audience
        }

        // For an audio call scenario, set the channel profile as communication.
        option.channelProfile = .communication

        // Join the channel with a temp token and channel name
        let result = agoraEngine.joinChannel(
            byToken: token, channelId: channelName, uid: 0, mediaOptions: option,
            joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in }
        )

        // Check if joining the channel was successful and set joined Bool accordingly
        if (result == 0) {
            joined = true
            showMessage(title: "Success", text: "Successfully joined the channel as \(self.userRole)")
        }
    }

    func leaveChannel() {
        let result = agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)
        // Check if leaving the channel was successful and set joined Bool accordingly
        if result == 0 { joined = false }
    }
    ```

### Start and stop your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

In this implementation, you initiate <Vpd k="SDK" /> when you open the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> user joins and leaves a call using the button.

To implement this feature:

1.  **Initialize <Vpd k="SDK" /> and local video when the view is loaded**

    In `ViewController`, update `viewDidLoad` as follows:

    ```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        // Initializes the video view
        initViews()
        // The following functions are used when calling Agora APIs
        initializeAgoraEngine()
    }
    ```

2.  **Leave the channel and clean up all the resources used by your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    In `ViewController`, add the following lines after the `viewDidLoad` function:

    <ViewDidDisappear />
