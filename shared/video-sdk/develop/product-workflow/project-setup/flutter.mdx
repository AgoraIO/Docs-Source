<PlatformWrapper platform="flutter">

If your target platform is Android, your app must run as a foreground service so that it is not killed when minimized. To add the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission, in `\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following line after `</application>`.

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
    ```

</PlatformWrapper>
