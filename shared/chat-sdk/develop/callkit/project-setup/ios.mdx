Take the following steps to integrate the AgoraChatCallKit into your project and set up the development environment.

### Add the AgoraChatCallKit framework

AgoraChatCallKit is developed upon `Agora_Chat_iOS`, `Masonry`, `AgoraRtcEngine_iOS/RtcBasic`, and `SDKWebImage`. Refer to the following steps to import AgoraChatCallKit into your project. If you prefer to add the framework manually, refer to [Manually import AgoraChatCallKit](#import).

1. Install CocoaPods if you have not. For details, see [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. If your project does not have a `Podfile` file, navigate to the project root directory, and run the `pod init` command to create a text file `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile` file, and add `use_frameworks` and the `AgoraChatCallKit` framework. Remember to replace `AppName` with the target name of your project.

   ```objc
    use_frameworks!
    // Replace AppName with the name of your project
    target 'AppName' do
        pod 'AgoraChatCallKit'
        // Other frameworks
    end
   ```

4. In the project root directory, run `pod install` to add the framework. When the SDK is installed successfully, you can see `Pod installation complete!` in the Terminal and an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder. 

5. Open the `xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

### Add permissions

Open the `info.plist` file, and add the following permissions:

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` | String | The description for using the microphone. For example, to access the microphone. |
| `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` | String | The description for using the camera. For example, to access the camera. |
