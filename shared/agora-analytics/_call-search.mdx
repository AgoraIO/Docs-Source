## Introduction

A new version of Call Inspector was released on May 5, 2022. This new version has the following advantages over the previous version:
- Locating user-specific issues through call-specific issues is more efficient, especially for large-scale calls.
- Key quality metrics and events now offer receiver's and sender's views, making it convenient to locate exceptions.
- Agora's auto-diagnosis engine is fully integrated to reduce the time cost of inspecting a call through intuitive conclusions. All features related to the auto-diagnosis engine are currently in beta.

<div class="alert note"><li>To help you transition smoothly, the new Call Inspector provides a one-click switch on the user interface so you can go back to the old version. This option is available until the old version goes offline, which is scheduled for May 19, 2022.</li><li>For calls started before April 19, 2022, the new Call Inspector is for reference only because it has higher requirements for data.</li></div>

### Feature overview

The new Call Inspector provides the following features:

- Find a call or a group of calls. See [Use Call Search](#search).

<div class="alert info">① The accessible time range depends on the data retention policy for Call Inspector features in your <a href="/agora-analytics/reference/pricing">pricing plan</a>.</div>


## Get Call Overview<a name="overview"></a>

The Call Overview page is designed to help you quickly understand the overall situation of a large-scale call, so that you can locate problems or users and inspect user-specific issues. This page includes a summary of exceptions, as well as comprehensive metric statistics.

To enter the Call Overview page, follow these steps:

1. Subscribe to the Premium or Enterprise pricing plan. See [Subscribe to a plan](/agora-analytics/reference/pricing#subscribe-to-a-plan). Other pricing plans do not provide access to the Call Overview page.
2. [Use Call Search](#search) to find the call you want to inspect, then click **Call Details** in the **Action** column.
   - If [the number of Accumulated Call Users (ACU)](call-search-terms#acu-accumulated-call-users) is greater than or equal to 50, you enter the Call Overview page.
   - If the number of ACU is less than 50, you first enter the Call Details page. Click the **Call Overview** tab on the top to switch.

The Call Overview page consists of the following sections.

### Exception summary

This section shows issues that might significantly affect user experience in the current call, including the following subsections:

## View Call Details<a name="details"></a>

The Call Details page helps you locate user-specific quality issues and exceptions.

The Call Details page consists of the following subpages:

- Homepage: The page you enter by clicking the **Call Details** tab on the top. On the homepage, you can get basic information about each user in the call. You can also view the key events and audio and video quality metrics for 20 users simultaneously.
- End-to-end details page: This page provides all of the key quality metrics and events for a single sender/receiver pair.
- Sender details page: This page provides all of the key quality metrics and events for a single sender.

For a detailed guide through each page, see [Call Details Breakdown](call-search-detail). For details on how to troubleshoot common call-quality issues, see [Troubleshooting Manual](/agora-analytics/develop/call-search-manual).


## View Call Diagnosis (Beta)<a name="diagnosis"></a>

The Call Diagnosis page embeds Agora's auto-diagnosis engine to examine user experience issues and detect exceptions. The engine gives diagnosis conclusions based on a mapping between experience issues and possible causes. Currently, the engine is able to detect a number of call experience issues and host-specific issues. For details, see [Diagnosis checklist items](call-search-terms#diagnosis-checklist-items).

![1650429448641](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1650429448641)

To view the Call Diagnosis page, follow these steps:

1. [Use Call Search](#search) to find the call you want to inspect, then click **Call Details** in the **Action** column.
2. Click the **Call Diagnosis (Beta)** tab at the top of the page.
3. Add the following filters, as needed:
   - User: Enter the user ID to add users one by one, or use advanced search to add users in a batch. You can add up to 10 users for each diagnosis.
   - Time: Drag the slider, or select from the drop-down menu.
   - Exception: Select the exception type from the drop-down menu, such as sending issue, receiving issue, network issue, capturing issue, abnormal behavior, or user experience exception issue.
4. Click a user in the returned list to see the diagnosis conclusion:
   - If only one user ID is displayed, the conclusion is for the corresponding user.
   - If two user IDs are displayed, the conclusion is for the corresponding sender/receiver pair.
5. (Optional) Click **View Details**:
   - If the conclusion is for a single user and the user is a sender, you enter the [sender details page](call-search-detail#sender-details-page).
   - If the conclusion is for a single user and the user is a receiver, you enter the [call details homepage ](call-search-detail), and the switch for **View metrics** is turned on for the user.
   - If the conclusion is for a sender/receiver pair, you enter their [end-to-end details page](call-search-detail#end-to-end-details-page).
