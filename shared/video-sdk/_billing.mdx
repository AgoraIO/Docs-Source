#### Additional charges

This section describes the additional charges applicable to your account.

#### Charging 8% Singapore Goods and Services Tax

As of November 2021, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Singapore charges [8% Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/goods-and-services-tax-(gst)-what-it-is-and-how-it-works) on invoices for all <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services provided to accounts located in Singapore. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> determines the account location based on the tax identification number, contact address, or billing address that you have provided. All GST collected from Singapore accounts is paid to the Singapore tax authority.

If you have any questions, contact sales@agora.io.

#### Fee deduction

On the sixth day of each month, <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> automatically deducts the fee for the previous month and notifies you by email. The services are free of charge, and <Vg k="COMPANY" /> does not deduct any fee when you meet both of the following requirements:

-   Your monthly total service minutes of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/> do not exceed 10,000 charge-free minutes; and

-   You do not use any other charged <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services or products.

If your account balance is negative after the deduction, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> sends you an email, reminding you to [top up your account](../reference/manage-agora-account#add-money-to-account) at your earliest convenience and avoid account suspension.

#### Account suspension

If your account balance is negative for 30 days since the deduction date, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> suspends your account and notifies you by email. None of your projects can access the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services.

If this happens, please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once your balance is greater than or equal to zero, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> unfreezes your account.


<Vg k="COMPANY" /> suspends your account on the second day after any of the following happens:

-   Your total service minutes using <Vpd k="NAME"/> exceed 10,000 charge-free minutes.

-   The number of daily active users (DAU) in your <Vg k="MESS" /> project exceeds 1,000.

-   You use any <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services or products not included in the 10,000 charge-free minutes and the usage exceeds the free quota of the services or products.

After account suspension, none of your projects can access the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services.

Please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once you top up your account, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> unfreezes your account and upgrades your account to a paid account.

### How does Agora calculate service minutes?

In <Vpd k="NAME"/>, service minutes are calculated either by the number of users or by the number of streams. Agora calculates service minutes **by the number of users**.

#### Approach 1: calculate by the number of users

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, the total service minutes = N \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* 10 = 50.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* 10 = 100.

In this approach, the service minutes purely depend on the number of the users in the channel, regardless of how many streams each user subscribes to.

#### Approach 2: calculate by the number of streams

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, and each user subscribes to all remote streams in the channel, the total service minutes = N \* (N-1) \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* (2-1) \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* (5-1) \* 10 = 200.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* (10-1) \* 10 = 900.

In this approach, if a user subscribes to multiple streams, every remote stream the user subscribes to is counted.

#### Difference between the two approaches

See the table below for the difference between the two approaches:

| Scenario                        | Service minutes by the number of users | Service minutes by the number of streams |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Two users talk for 10 minutes.  | 20 minutes                             | 20 minutes                               |
| Five users talk for 10 minutes. | 50 minutes                             | 200 minutes                              |
| 10 users talk for 10 minutes.   | 100 minutes                            | 900 minutes                              |

The difference between the two approaches become greater when more people join the channel.

### Calculation approach by Agora

Agora calculates service minutes **by the number of users**, which is easier and more straightforward.
