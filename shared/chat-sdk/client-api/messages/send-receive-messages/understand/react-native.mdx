The Chat SDK uses the `ChatMessage` and `ChatMessage` classes to send, receive, and withdraw messages.

The process of sending and receiving a message is as follows:

1. The message sender creates a text, file, or attachment message using the corresponding `Create` method.
2. The message sender calls `sendMessage` to send the message.
3. The message recipient listens for `ChatMessageEventListener` and receives the message in the `onMessagesReceived` callback.
