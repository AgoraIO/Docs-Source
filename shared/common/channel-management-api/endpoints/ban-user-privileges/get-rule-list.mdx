This method gets the list of all banning rules.

### Prototype

- Method: `GET`
- Endpoint: `https://api.agora.io/dev/v1/kicking-rule`

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In order to maximize the success rate of the core create (POST), update (PUT), and delete (DELETE) functions, the success rate and accuracy of the query (GET) method will be degraded to a certain extent when the quality of the public network is abnormally low. Some request records may be missing in the returned results of the query (GET). When calling POST to create a rule (`time` is not set to 0), which you need to update or delete later, we recommend the following operations:

* Save the rule ID returned in the POST request on your server, and rely on this ID for subsequent update and delete operations.
* To ensure that you can still obtain the rule ID returned in POST during poor network connections, set the timeout for the POST request to 20 seconds or higher. Make sure that the timeout is set to no less than 5 seconds.
* In case the POST request times out or returns a `504` error, use the response of the GET method to obtain the rule ID. If the rule exists, it indicates that the POST request is successful, and you can save the rule ID on your server.
