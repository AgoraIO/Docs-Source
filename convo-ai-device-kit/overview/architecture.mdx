  Technical architecture, performance specifications, and hardware details for Convo AI Device Kit R1.
---

The Convo AI Device Kit solution is built on Agora's Media Stream Acceleration (RTSA) or IoT SDK and Conversational AI Engine. RTSA is Agora's RTC client product designed specifically for the IoT industry, providing the real-time communication foundation for voice AI interactions.

### Solution architecture

The Convo AI Device Kit solution consists of two main components connected through Agora's <Vg k="BACKEND_NAME"/>.

- **Convo AI Device Kit**

  The hardware device handles local processing including power management, Bluetooth pairing, voice wake-up, OTA updates, and peripheral driver support. It captures audio and video through dedicated modules, encodes the data, and transmits it through RTSA (Real-Time Streaming Acceleration) to Agora's SD-RTN. The device also receives and decodes audio/video responses for playback.

- **Conversational AI Engine** 

  The cloud service processes the incoming audio and video streams. It has two main components:

  - **Convo AI Core**: Handles AI-powered voice activity detection (VAD), noise reduction, echo cancellation, interruption detection, background voice filtering, and snapshot/frame capture

  - **Cascade Model**: Processes the audio through Speech-to-Text (STT), sends the text to a Large Language Model (LLM), and converts the response back to speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The system uses G.711/G.722 audio codecs and MJPEG/H.264 video codecs for efficient real-time transmission between the device and cloud services, enabling low-latency conversational AI interactions.

### Hardware architecture

The R1 Kit integrates multiple hardware components to enable multimodal AI interactions:

## Advanced audio algorithms

The Convo AI Device Kit employs specialized algorithms to ensure accurate voice recognition and natural conversation flow in challenging environments.

### AI noise reduction

Filters 95% of environmental noise, enabling accurate recognition even in challenging environments like coffee shops and train stations, preventing interaction errors.

### BHVS and voiceprint algorithms

- **Background Human Voice Separation (BHVS)**: Filters background voices in multi-person conversation scenarios
- **Voiceprint recognition**: Locks onto the primary speaker in multi-person conversations

### Graceful interruption algorithm

Enables AI to detect user interruption intent in real-time and precisely determine when to speak and when to stop, restoring natural conversation rhythm.

### Weak network resistance

Maintains uninterrupted voice interaction even in challenging network conditions like subways and basements, with 80% packet loss resistance capability to maintain conversation continuity.
