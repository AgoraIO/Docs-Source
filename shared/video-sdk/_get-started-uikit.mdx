This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="NAME"/> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="UIK" />.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you integrate into your app in order to achieve {props.product} functionality using <Vg k="UIK" />.

![Image](/images/video-calling/video-call.png)

To using <Vg k="UIK" />, you implement the following steps in your app:

1.  **Create an instance of the viewer**

    Declare and initialize an instance of the <Vg k="UIK" /> viewer.

2.  **Join a channel**

    When you execute the `join` command, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.

    Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate {props.product} into your {props.client} using {props.sdk}, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="NAME"/>

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
When a user opens the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you initialize <Vg k="UIK" />.
</PlatformWrapper>

When the user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing <Vg k="COMPANY" /> features and not UX bells and whistles.

To integrate real-time video with a ready-made user interface into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="UIK" />:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="NAME"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _Join_.
