#### Compatibility changes

**SDK structural optimization**

The SDK for ReactJS is developed based on the SDK for Web v4.x. To further enhance usability, this version incorporates all Web SDK APIs into the ReactJS SDK, eliminating the need to integrate the Web SDK separately.

Upon upgrading to this version, make the following modifications:

- Reintegrate the React SDK. Taking npm as an example:

  ```sh
  # Remove existing dependencies
  npm uninstall agora-rtc-react agora-rtc-sdk-ng
  # Reinstall dependencies
  npm install agora-rtc-react
  ```

- Adjust the import of the `AgoraRTC` interface from the Web SDK. Taking the combined import of `AgoraRTC` and `AgoraRTCProvider` as an example:

  ```jsx
  // Before this version
  import AgoraRTC from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng";
  import { AgoraRTCProvider } from "agora-rtc-react";
  // As of this version
  import AgoraRTC, { AgoraRTCProvider } from "agora-rtc-react"
  ```

**NetworkQuality renaming**

To avoid redundancy with the Web SDK's API, this version makes the following changes to the ReactJS SDK's `NetworkQuality` interface:

- Rename `NetworkQuality` to `NetworkQualityEx` and have `NetworkQualityEx` inherit the `NetworkQuality` interface from the Web SDK.
- Rename the `uplink` and `downlink` properties to `uplinkNetworkQuality` and `downlinkNetworkQuality`, respectively.

If you use the `NetworkQuality` interface from the ReactJS SDK, make the necessary code modifications after upgrading to this version.

#### Improvements

This version adds the `cameraVideoTrackConfig` parameter to `useLocalCameraTrack`, enabling you to set video capture configurations such as capture devices and encoder when creating a camera video track.

#### Fixed issues

This version fixed the issue that the SDK threw the error `CAN_NOT_PUBLISH_MULTIPLE_VIDEO_TRACKS` in Firefox's developer mode.

#### API Changes

**Added**

- `cameraVideoTrackConfig` to `useLocalCameraTrack`

**Modified**

- `NetworkQuality` to `NetworkQualityEx`
  - `uplink`  to `uplinkNetworkQuality`
  - `downlink` to `downlinkNetworkQuality`
