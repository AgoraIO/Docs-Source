This page shows you how to configure volume settings for audio recording, audio playback, and for the playback of music files.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> supports adjusting the audio volume for both recording and playback to meet practical application scenarios. For example, during a two-person call, you can mute a remote user, by adjusting the playback volume setting to 0.

The figure below shows the workflow of adjusting the volume.

#### Playback
**Playback** refers to transmitting an audio signal from a sender to a recipient, where it is played back through a playback device.

#### In-Ear Monitoring
**In-ear monitoring** refers to the process of playing audio captured by a device.

#### Acquisition 
**Recording** refers to the process in which audio signals are captured by a recording device and then sent to the transmitter.
