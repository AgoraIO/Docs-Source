The structure of the conversation object is as follows:

```javascript
interface ConversationItem {
  // Conversation ID.
  conversationId: string;
  // Conversation type: single chat and group chat are `singleChat` and `groupChat` respectively.
  conversationType: ConversationType;
  // The number of unread messages in the conversation.
  unReadCount?: number;
  // The latest message.
  lastMessage?: LocalMessageBody;
  // Conversation custom fields.
  customField?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Retrieve conversations

You can call the `getLocalConversations` method to get a list of all local conversations at once. After obtaining the conversations, the SDK returns the list in the reverse order of the conversation active time (the timestamp of the latest message). The conversation list data is a `<ConversationItem[]>` structure.

The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
miniCore.localCache.getLocalConversations().then((res) => {
  // Obtain local conversation list successfully.
  console.log(res);
});
```

### Retrieve a local conversation

You can call the `getLocalConversation` method to obtain a single local conversation object. The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  // Conversation type: single chat and group chat are `singleChat` and `groupChat` respectively.
  conversationType: "singleChat",
  // Conversation ID.
  conversationId: "conversationId",
};

miniCore.localCache.getLocalConversation(options).then((res) => {
  // Obtained local conversation successfully.
  console.log(res);
});
```

### Set conversation custom fields

You can call the `setLocalConversationCustomField` method to set the custom field of the local conversation, that is, pass in the key-value object, where key is the field name and value is the field value.

The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  // Conversation type: single chat and group chat are `singleChat` and `groupChat` respectively.
  conversationType: "singleChat",
  // Conversation ID.
  conversationId: "conversationId",
  // Conversation custom fields.
  customField: { custom: "custom" },
};

miniCore.localCache.setLocalConversationCustomField(options).then(() => {
  // Set conversation custom fields successfully.
});
```

### Clear the number of unread messages in a conversation

You can call the `clearConversationUnreadCount` method to clear the number of unread messages in a single local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  // Conversation type: single chat and group chat are `singleChat` and `groupChat` respectively.
  conversationType: "singleChat",
  // Conversation ID.
  conversationId: "conversationId",
};

miniCore.localCache.clearConversationUnreadCount(options).then(() => {
  // Successfully cleared the number of unread messages for the specified conversation.
});
```

### Delete a conversation

You can call the `removeLocalConversation` method to delete a single local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  // Conversation type: single chat and group chat are `singleChat` and `groupChat` respectively.
  conversationType: "singleChat",
  // Conversation ID.
  conversationId: "conversationId",
  // Whether to delete local messages, the default value is `true`.
  isRemoveLocalMessage: true,
};

miniCore.localCache.removeLocalConversation(options).then(() => {
  // Deleted local conversation successfully.
});
```

### Clear chat history

To clear the current user's chat history, including messages and conversations in individual chats, group chats, and chat rooms, you can call the `deleteAllMessagesAndConversations` method. Note that clearing the chat history on the server means that you will not be able to retrieve conversations and messages from the server, although other users will not be affected.

```javascript
chatClient.deleteAllMessagesAndConversations().then(() => {
  // Cleared all conversation and message records successfully
});
```

### Synchronize server conversation list to local

You can call the `getServerConversations` method to get the server conversation list and synchronize it to the local database. The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  /** The expected number of conversations per page. The value range is [1,50], and the default is `20`. */
  pageSize: 20,
  /** The cursor position to start getting data. If an empty string ('') is passed, the SDK starts to obtain the conversations from the latest active conversation. */
  cursor: "",
};
miniCore.contact.getServerConversations(options).then((res) => {
  // Obtain the server conversation list and synchronize the local successfully.
  console.log(res);
});
```

### Import the Web SDK files as required

If you want to minimize the SDK size, you can import the SDK files as required.

| Function            | File for import                                                             | Usage                                                   |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contact and message | `import \* as contactPlugin from "agora-chat/contact/contact";`             | `miniCore.usePlugin(contactPlugin, "contact");`         |
| Group               | `import \* as groupPlugin from "agora-chat/group/group";`                   | `miniCore.usePlugin(groupPlugin, "group");`             |
| Chat room           | `import \* as chatroomPlugin from "agora-chat/chatroom/chatroom";`          | `miniCore.usePlugin(chatroomPlugin, "chatroom");`       |
| Thread              | `import \* as threadPlugin from "agora-chat/thread/thread";`                | `miniCore.usePlugin(threadPlugin, "thread");`           |
| Translation         | `import \* as translationPlugin from "agora-chat/translation/translation";` | `miniCore.usePlugin(translationPlugin, "translation");` |
| Presence            | `import \* as presencePlugin from "agora-chat/presence/presence";`          | `miniCore.usePlugin(presencePlugin, "presence");`       |

The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
import MiniCore from "agora-chat/miniCore/miniCore";
import * as contactPlugin from "agora-chat/contact/contact";

const miniCore = new MiniCore({
  appKey: "your appKey",
});

// The fixed value "contact" is used here.
miniCore.usePlugin(contactPlugin, "contact");

// Get the contact list.
miniCore.contact.getContacts();

// Add the listener.
miniCore.addEventHandler("handlerId", {
  onTextMessage: (message) => {},
});

// Login
miniCore.open({
  username: "username",
  accessToken: "accessToken",
});
```
