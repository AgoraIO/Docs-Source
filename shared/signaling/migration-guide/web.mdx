## Integrate the SDK

The SDK package names for <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` and `1.x` are different. Both versions, however, support integration via CDN and npm.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cdn" label="Using CDN">

    To use CDN, directly add the following code to your web application or download the SDK file for local reference.

  <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` integration:

    ```javascript 
    // Replace x.y.z with the specific SDK version number, such as 2.2.0
    <script src="your_path_to_sdk/agora-rtm.x.y.z.min.js"></script>
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="Using npm">
  
    1. Install the SDK via npm package manager in your terminal.
    
        `npm install agora-rtm-sdk`

    2. Import it into your `app.js`.
    
        `import AgoraRTM from 'agora-rtm-sdk';`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize a client instance

Compared to `1.x`, <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` makes significant adjustments to the initialization parameters, adding many new features such as client-side encryption and cloud proxy. For details, see the [API Reference](../reference/api/). Additionally, <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` optimizes error handling within the `try {...} catch {...}` programming model by categorizing potential errors and using the `ErrorInfo` data structure for callbacks, helping you troubleshoot issues more efficiently. By referencing the [Error Codes](../reference/api#error-codes-table) table, you can quickly find the cause of an error and its solution.

- Sample code for <Vg k="SIG" /> `1.x`:

    ```javascript
    let options = {
      uid: "",
      token: ""
    }
    // Fill in the App ID you obtained from the console
    const appID = "<Your app ID>";
    // Fill in your user ID
    options.uid = "<Your uid>";
    // Fill in your token
    options.token = "<Your token>";
    // Initialize the client instance
    const rtm = AgoraRTM.createInstance(appID);
    ```

- Sample code for <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`:

    ```javascript
    // Initialize the client instance
    const { RTM } = AgoraRTM;
    // Fill in the App ID you obtained from the console
    const appId = "your_appId";
    // Fill in your user ID
    const userId = "your_userId";

    try {
      const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId);
    } catch (status) {
      console.log(status);
    }
    ```

## Log in to Signaling

<Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` adopts the standard Async/Await pattern, enabling support for asynchronous programming. The method for logging into Signaling in `2.x` differs from `1.x`, as follows:

- Sample code for <Vg k="SIG" /> `1.x`:

    ```javascript
    await rtm.login(options)
    ```

- Sample code for <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`:

    ```javascript
    const token = 'your_token'
    try {
      const result = await rtm.login({ token });
      console.log(result);
    } catch (status) {
      console.log(status);
    }
    ```

## Event notifications

<Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` redesigns the system event notification model and API interface to offer a more detailed classification and aggregation of event notification types. It also optimizes the payload data structure of event notifications.

The following table lists the types of event notifications in <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`:

| Event Type | Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
| <code className="index-api-onmessageevent" id={config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-onmessageevent">Message Event Notification: Receives all message event notifications from the Message channel and Topic that the user subscribes to.</span> |
| <code className="index-api-onpresenceevent" id={config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-onpresenceevent">Presence Event Notification: Receives all presence event notifications from the Message channel and Stream channel that the user subscribes to or joins.</span> |
| <code className="index-api-ontopicevent" id={config.ontopicevent[props.ag_platform]}>{config.ontopicevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-ontopicevent">Topic Change Event Notification: Receives all topic change notifications from the Stream channel that the user joins.</span> |
| <code className="index-api-onstorageevent" id={config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-onstorageevent">Channel and User Metadata Event Notification: Receives all channel metadata event notifications from the Message channel and Stream channel, and user metadata event notifications from subscribed users.</span> |
| <code className="index-api-onlockevent" id={config.onlockevent[props.ag_platform]}>{config.onlockevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-onlockevent">Lock Event Notification: Receives all lock event notifications from the Message channel and Stream channel that the user subscribes to or joins.</span> |
| <code className="index-api-onconnection" id={config.onconnection[props.ag_platform]}>{config.onconnection[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-onconnection">Network Connection Status Change Notification: Receives notifications about changes in the client's network connection status.</span> |
| <code>{config.onlinkstateevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> | Receives notifications about changes in the client's network connection status, including information on the state before and after the change, service type, operation type, reason for the change, and channel list. |
| <code className="index-api-ontokenwillexpire" id={config.ontokenwillexpire[props.ag_platform]}>{config.ontokenwillexpire[props.ag_platform]}</code> | <span class="index-desc-ontokenwillexpire">Receives notifications about the impending expiration of the client's token.</span> |

For more information on event notifications and payload data structures, see [Event Listeners](../reference/api#event-listeners).

The following example shows how to listen for <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notifications:

- <Vg k="SIG" /> `1.x`:

    ```javascript
    let channel = rtm.createChannel("demoChannel");
    channel.on('ChannelMessage', function (message, memberId) {
      console.log(memberId + ": " + message.text);
    });
    ```

- <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`:

    ```javascript
    rtm.addEventListener("message", event => {
      const channelType = event.channelType;
      const channelName = event.channelName;
      const topic = event.topicName;
      const messageType = event.messageType;
      const customType = event.customType;
      const publisher = event.publisher;
      const message = event.message;
      const timestamp = event.timestamp;
    });
    ```

Notice the following significant differences:

- In `1.x`, message event notifications are bound to a specific `channel` instance. Users need to first call the `createChannel()` method to create a `channel` instance, and then bind event handlers using `channel.on()`. Multiple channels require multiple bindings. In <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`, message event notifications are bound to the client instance and are set globally. You register callbacks with the `addEventListener()` method, binding only once to listen to all subscribed channels or topics.

- The payload data structure for message event notifications in `1.x` contains limited information, while <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`'s payload data structure includes more detailed information, helping you implement your business logic more effectively.

## Channel messages

In `1.x`, sending channel messages involves the following steps:

1. Create a channel instance
1. Join the channel
1. Send a channel message

The drawback of this design is that you cannot send a message without receiving it, as sending and receiving messages are coupled. <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` adopts a new Pub/Sub-based design, decoupling sending and receiving channel messages. You can send messages to a specified channel without joining it, and you can receive messages from a channel simply by subscribing to it. These operations are independent of each other.

- The sample code for `1.x` is as follows:

    ```javascript
    let channel = rtm.createChannel("demoChannel");
    await channel.join();
    let payload = "Hello World!";
    await channel.sendMessage({ text: payload }).then(() => {
        console.log("Channel message:" + payload + " from " + channel.channelId);
    }
    ```

- The sample code for <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` is as follows:

    ```javascript
    // Send channel message
    const payload = "Hello World!";
    try {
        const result = await rtm.publish("demoChannel", payload, { channelType: 'MESSAGE' });
        console.log(result);
    } catch (status) {
        console.log(status);
    }

    // Subscribe to a channel
    try {
        const result = await rtm.subscribe("chat_room");
        console.log(result);
    } catch (status) {
        console.log(status); 
    } 
    ```

## Peer-to-peer messaging

To send messages to a specified user in `1.x`, the point-to-point message API is used. For example, if you want to send a message to a user with the ID `Tony`, you do so as follows:

```javascript
// 1.x
rtm
  .sendMessageToPeer(
    { text: "test peer message" }, // An RtmMessage instance
    "PeerId", // Remote user's ID
  )
  .then((sendResult) => {
    if (sendResult.hasPeerReceived) {
      // You need to implement the logic for when the remote user has received the message
    } else {
      // You need to implement the logic for when the server has received the message but the remote user has not
    }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // You need to implement the logic for handling failures in sending point-to-point messages
  });
```

Starting with version 2.2.0, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> has modified point-to-point messaging and defined it as User channels. Messages are sent using the <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> method and received via the <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. This new method provides functionality identical to point-to-point messaging in `1.x`, and can be implemented as follows:

```javascript
// 2.x
// Applicable for version 2.2.0 and later
rtm
  .publish(
    "test peer message",
    "PeerId", // Remote user's ID
    { channelType: "USER" },
  )
  .then((sendResult) => {
    // implement the logic for when the remote user receives the message
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // implement the logic for handling failures in sending point-to-point messages
  });
```

You can also implement an inbox feature using a Message channel as follows. However, in this case, the sender does not receive a delivery receipt.

```javascript
// 2.x
// 1. Subscribe to your own inbox
const result = await rtm.subscribe("inbox_Tony");
// Message content
const payload = JSON.stringify(
  {
    type: "PrivateMessage",
    message: "This is a message",
    sender: "Tony",
  }
);
try {
  // 2. Send a private message to the user with ID Lily; this message will only be received by Lily
  const result = await rtm.publish("inbox_Lily", payload, { channelType: 'MESSAGE' });
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

## Picture and file messages

For reasons of user data privacy, compliance and cost optimization, Signaling `2.x` no longer directly supports image and file message types. After version `1.5.0`, the related interfaces have been deprecated. However, this does not mean that you cannot use Signaling to transmit and distribute image and file messages. You can build image and file message functions with the help of Signaling `2.x` and third-party object storage services, such as Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS. Not only can you get the best factual message transmission experience, you can also implement more flexible technical solutions. For example, CDN static resource acceleration or image and text moderation. The following code sample shows you how to use Signaling `2.x` and Amazon S3 object storage service to build and send image and file messages.

```js
const sendFileMessageAsync = async () => {
  try {
    // Use the document-picker component to select a file from the device
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
      // You can choose any type of file
      type: "*/*",
    });

    if (result.canceled === false) {
      const file = result.assets[0].file;
      if (file) {
        const uploadParams = {
          // Fill in your bucket name on Amazon S3
          Bucket: "your-awsbucket",
          // The key for the file on Amazon S3
          Key: file.name,
          Body: file,
          ContentType: file.type,
        };
        // Upload the file to S3
        s3.upload(uploadParams, (err, data) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error("Error uploading file:", err);
          } else {
            console.log("File uploaded successfully. S3 URL:", data.Location);
            // After the file is uploaded successfully, create a custom file message payload
            const imageMessagePayload = {
              // File type; the receiver can parse the message structure based on this field
              type: "File",
              // Your bucket name on Amazon S3; the receiver needs this to download the file
              bucket: uploadParams.Bucket,
              // The key of the file stored on Amazon S3; the receiver needs this to download the file
              key: uploadParams.Key,
              // File type
              contentType: uploadParams.ContentType,
              // File URL
              url: data.Location,
              // Sender's user ID
              sender: userId,
            };
            // Use Signaling 2.x to send the file message payload
            rtm.publish(channelName, JSON.stringify(imageMessagePayload), {
              customType: "File",
              channelType: "MESSAGE",
            });
          }
        });
      }
    } else {
      console.log("Document pick cancelled");
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error picking document:", err);
  }
};
```

## User presence and custom status

In Signaling `1.x`, you can subscribe to or query the online status of multiple users, query the number of users in a channel, or obtain the list of online members in a channel. Signaling `2.x` not only retains these features, but also implements upgrades and extends them. In Signaling `2.x`, these capabilities are redefined and implemented in the Presence module. Presence provides the ability to monitor user online, user offline and user status change notifications. Through the Presence module, you can obtain the following information in real time:

- A user joins or leaves the specified channel
- Customize temporary user status and its changes
- Query which channels a specified user has joined or is subscribed to
- Query which users have joined the specified channel and their temporary status data

Call the <code>{presence.whonow[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to query the number of online users in the specified channel, the list of online users, and the temporary status of online users in real-time.

```javascript
// 2.x
const options = {
  includedUserId : true,
  includedState : true,
  page : "yourBookMark"
}
try {
  const result = await rtm.presence.whoNow( "chat_room", "MESSAGE", options );
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

Call the <code>{presence.wherenow[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to get a list of channels where a specified user is present in real-time.

```javascript
// 2.x
try {
  const result = await rtm.presence.whereNow( "Tony" );
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

To meet the needs of business scenarios for user status settings, 2.x provides the ability to set temporary user status. You can customize temporary user status using the <code>{presence.setstate[props.ag_platform]}</code> method. Users can share custom statuses such as score, game status, location, mood, and mic status.

```js
// 2.x
var newState = { "mood":"pumped", "isTyping":false};

try {
  const result = await rtm.Presence.setState("chat_room", "MESSAGE", newState);
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

You can also obtain a user's online status at any time using the `getState` method, or delete a user's status using the `removeState` method. After a user's temporary status changes, <Vg k="SIG" /> triggers a `REMOTE_STATE_CHANGED` type `presence` event notification. For details, see [User status management](../core-functionality/presence#user-status-management).

In <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`, listening for notifications about users joining, leaving, timing out, or changing temporary status in a channel is more convenient. You only need to follow these steps:

1. Implement a Presence event listener
2. When joining a channel, enable the `withPresence` switch


```javascript
 // 2.x
 // Implement a Presence event listener
rtm.addEventListener("presence", event => {
  const action = event.eventType;
  const channelType = event.channelType;
  const channelName = event.channelName;
  const publisher = event.publisher;
  const states = event.stateChanged;
  const interval = event.interval;
  const snapshot = event.snapshot;
 // Your implementation code
});

// When subscribing to a channel, enable the withPresence switch
const options ={ withPresence : true };
try {
  const result = await rtm.subscribe("chat_room", options);
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

<Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` introduces a new design for real-time notifications. There are two modes to deliver Presence event notifications to subscribed users in a channel: 

- Real-Time Notification Mode (Announce) 
- Scheduled Notification Mode (Interval)

You can set the condition for switching between these two modes using the **Announce Max** size in the project's console settings. The Scheduled Notification Mode helps prevent event noise caused by too many online users in a channel. For further details, see [Event Notification Modes](../core-functionality/presence#real-time-notification-mode).

## User metadata and channel metadata

Based on the user and channel attributes functionality in `1.x`, <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` adds capabilities such as version control and lock control, and optimizes the API interface to make the usage simpler. In <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x`, user attributes and channel attributes are mounted under the Storage module. The following sample demonstrates how to set channel attributes:

```javascript
// 2.x
const properties = {
  key : "Quantity",
  value : "20"
};

const announcement = {
  key : "Announcement",
  value : "Welcome to our shop!"
};

const price = {
  key : "T-shirt",
  value : "100"
};

const data = [properties, announcement, price];
const options = { addTimeStamp : true, addUserId : true };

try {
  const result = await rtm.storage.setChannelMetadata("channel1", "MESSAGE", data, options);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
} catch (status) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(status));
}
```

For information on how to obtain, update, and delete channel attributes, and how to use CAS control and lock control, please refer to [Store channel metadata](../core-functionality/store-channel-metadata). The use of user attributes is similar to that of channel attributes, see [Store user metadata](../core-functionality/store-user-metadata) for details.

<Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` distributes channel attributes and user attributes to users through event notifications of the `storage` type. To listen for storage event notifications:

1. Implement the `storage` event listener
2. When joining a channel, turn on the `withMetadata` switch

```javascript
// 2.x
// Implement a Storage event listener
rtm.addEventListener("storage", event => {
  const channelType = event.channelType;
  const channelName = event.channelName;
  const publisher = event.publisher;
  const storageType = event.storageType;
  const action = event.eventType;
  const data = event.data;
 // Your implementation code
});
 // When joining a channel, enable the withMetadata switch
const options ={ withMetadata : false };
try {
  const result = await rtm.subscribe("chat_room", options);
  console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
  console.log(status);
}
```

## Restrict access area 

<Vg k="SIG" /> supports the access area restriction function to adapt to the laws and regulations of different countries or regions. After enabling the access area restriction function, no matter which region the user uses your app in, the SDK only accesses the Agora server in the specified region. The implementation of access area restriction in <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` is the same as for `1.x`:

```javascript
AgoraRTM.setArea({ areaCodes: ["GLOBAL"], excludedArea: "CHINA" })
```

## Other new features

In addition to the functional differences between the above versions, <Vg k="SIG" /> `2.x` also adds many new features. Choose and use them according to the needs of your project.
