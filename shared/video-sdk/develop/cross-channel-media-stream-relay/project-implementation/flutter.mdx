To implement cross-channel media stream relay in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. Start cross-channel media stream relay

    After joining a channel, call `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` to configure the source and target channel information and start forwarding a media stream. 

    ```dart
    // Configures the source channel information for media relay.
    final srcChannelInfo = ChannelMediaInfo(
      channelName: sourceChannelName,
      token: srcToken, // Token generated with UID 0.
      uid: 0,
    );

    // Configures the destination channel information for media relay.
    final destChannelInfo = ChannelMediaInfo(
      channelName: destChannelName,
      token: destToken,
      uid: 0,
    );

    // Creates the media relay configuration with source and destination channels.
    final mediaRelayConfiguration = ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration(
      srcChannelInfo: srcChannelInfo,
      destInfos: {destChannelName: destChannelInfo},
    );

    // Starts relaying media streams from the source channel to the destination channel.
    await engine.startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay(mediaRelayConfiguration);
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="information">
    * Best practice is to set the UID of the source channel to `0`, allowing the SDK to assign a random UID.
    * The source channel token in `srcChannelInfo` should be different from the one used when joining the source channel. Generate a new token using the source channel name and `uid = 0`.
    * For the destination channel, set the uid to `0`, to allow the SDK to assign a random `uid`, or specify a `uid`, ensuring that it is different from all UIDs in the target channel.

2. Update media stream relay channels

    To forward the stream to multiple target channels or exit the current forwarding channel after staring channel media relay, call `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` again to add or remove target channels for forwarding.

    <Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
    The updated configuration completely **replaces** the previous configuration.
    </Admonition>

3. Pause or resume media stream relay

    To pause forwarding the media stream to all target channels, call `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`.

    ```dart
    await engine.pauseAllChannelMediaRelay();
    isPaused = true;
    ```

    To resume forwarding the media stream to all target channels, call `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`.

    ```dart
    await engine.resumeAllChannelMediaRelay();
    isPaused = false;
    ```

4. Stop cross-channel media stream relay

    To stop forwarding the media stream, call `stopChannelMediaRelay`. When forwarding stops, the host exits all target channels.

    ```dart
    await engine.stopChannelMediaRelay();
    mediaRelaying = false;
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Note">
    If this method fails, call `leaveChannel` to leave the channel and stop cross-channel media stream relay.
    </Admonition>

5. Monitor cross-channel media stream status

    During cross-channel media stream relay, the SDK reports changes in the status of media stream relay through the `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged` callback. Implement the relevant business logic based on the [status codes](#status-codes).

    ```dart
    engine.registerEventHandler(
      RtcEngineEventHandler(
        onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged: (state, code) {
          switch (state) {
            case ChannelMediaRelayState.relaying:
              mediaRelaying = true;
              print("Channel media relay connected.");
              break;
            case ChannelMediaRelayState.failure:
              mediaRelaying = false;
              print("Channel media relay failed with error code: $code");
              break;
            default:
              break;
          }
        },
      ),
    );
    ```
