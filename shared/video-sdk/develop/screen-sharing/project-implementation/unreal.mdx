This section introduces how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project. The basic API call sequence is shown in the figure below:

![Screen Share Process](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-macos-unreal.svg)

There are two options to enable <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> you can choose from according to the actual scenario:

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` before joining the channel, then call `joinChannel [2/2]` to join the channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` after joining the channel, then call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

The flowcharts and steps in this article are based on the first scenario.

### Get resource list

Call `getScreenCaptureSources` to get an object list of screens and windows that can be shared. The list contains important information such as **window ID** and **screen ID**. This allows users to choose to share the screen of a certain monitor or a window through the thumbnails in the list. The sample code is as follows:

    ``` cpp
    {
        // Get information about a specified shareable window or screen
        agora::rtc::IScreenCaptureSourceList* listCapture = m_rtcEngine->getScreenCaptureSources(sz, sz, true);
        for (int i = 0; i < listCapture->getCount(); i++)
        {
            // Returns information about a shareable window or screen
            agora::rtc::ScreenCaptureSourceInfo info = listCapture->getSourceInfo(i);
        }

        // Get the number of windows and screens that can be shared
        return static_cast<int>(m_listWnd.GetCount());
    }
    ```

### Enable <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Depending on the actual application scenario, choose one of the following three <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> methods.

#### Share your entire screen

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` with the following parameters to start sharing the whole screen:

    - Set `displayId` to the `sourceId` (screen ID) obtained in the previous step.
    - Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
        - In document scenes or remote control scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 fps**.
        - In game scenes or video scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 fps**.

    ``` cpp
    // Start sharing the specified screen
    m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByDisplayId(id, regionRect, capParam);
    ```

#### Share app window

Call `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` with the following parameters to start sharing an entire app window:

    - Set `windowId` to the `sourceId` (window ID) obtained in the previous step.
    - Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
        - In document scenes or remote control scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 fps**.
        - In game scenes or video scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 fps**.

    ``` cpp
    // Start sharing a specified app window
    ret = m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByWindowId(hWnd, rcCapWnd, capParam);
    ```

#### Share a designated area

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` method to start sharing, and set `regionRect` to the position of the area you want to share relative to the whole screen or window. The sample code is as follows:

    ``` cpp
    // Set the parameters of the area you want to share
    // If the sharing area is set to extend beyond the boundaries of the screen, only the content within the screen is shared
    // If the width or height is set to 0, the entire screen is shared
    m_screenRegion = { 0,0,heightX,heightY };
    agora::rtc::Rectangle rcCapWnd = { m_screenRegion.x, m_screenRegion.y, (int)(m_screenRegion.width * scale), (int)(m_screenRegion.height * scale) };
    ...
    m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByDisplayId(id, rcCapWnd, m_screenParam);
    ```

### Set up a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario (Optional)

Call the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method to set the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario. Set the `screenScenario` to any one of the following according to the actual usage scenario:

    - SCREEN_SCENARIO_DOCUMENT(1): Document scenario
    - SCREEN_SCENARIO_GAMING(2): Game scenario
    - SCREEN_SCENARIO_VIDEO(3): Video scenario
    - SCREEN_SCENARIO_RDC(4): Remote control scenario

The sample code is as follows:

    ``` cpp
    m_rtcEngine->setScreenCaptureScenario(type);
    ```

### Join a channel and publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream

Call `joinChannel`[2/2] to join the channel and set the channel media options. The sample code is as follows:

    ``` cpp
    // Set Channel Media Options
    ChannelMediaOptions option;
    option.channelProfile = CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING;
    option.clientRoleType = CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER;
    option.publishMicrophoneTrack  = true;
    // Publish the screen captured video to the channel
    // If you want to publish a second screen captured video in the channel, replace the next line of code with option.publishSecondaryScreenTrack = true；
    option.publishScreenTrack = true;
    // Join the channel
    m_rtcEngine->joinChannel("Your Token", "Your ChannelId", 0, option)
    ```

#### Additional notes

This article uses the example of publishing the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream directly in the channel without publishing the stream captured by the camera. The streaming method in actual application scenarios may be different from the description in this article. Please adjust your code logic based on the actual application scenario. If you need to publish the stream captured by the camera and the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream at the same time, please refer to the following steps:

    - Call `joinChannel`[2/2] to join the first channel and publish the video stream collected by the camera in this channel.
    - Call `joinChannelEx` to join a second channel in which to publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream.

### Update <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters (Optional)

In the channel, you can call the following methods to dynamically update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters:

    - If you want to update the shared region of the screen, call the `updateScreenCaptureRegion` method to reset the `regionRect` parameter and define a new sharing area.
    - If you want to update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters (for example: video encoding resolution, frame rate, bit rate, stroke the screen or app window, whether to block a specified window, etc.), call the `updateScreenCaptureParameters` method and update the `captureParams` parameter configuration.

    The sample code is as follows:

        ``` cpp
        // Update the screen share area
        int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureRegion(rect);

        // Update Screen Sharing Parameters
        int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
        ```

### Stroke the screen (Optional)

Depending on the actual usage scenario, you can stroke the screen or window in the following two ways:

    - Stroke when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`, set `enableHighLight` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both `highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.
    - Stroke after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `enableHighLight` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both ``highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.

    ``` cpp
    bool highLigne = m_chkHighLight.GetCheck();
    m_screenParam.enableHighLight = highLigne;
    // Setting the stroke color of the screen
    m_screenParam.highLightColor = 0xFFFF0000;
    // Setting the stroke width of the screen
    m_screenParam.highLightWidth = 5;
    // Enable Screen Stroke
    int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
    ```

### Block window (Optional)

Depending on the actual usage scenario, you can block a specified window using the following two ways:

    - Block windows when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.
    - Block windows after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.

    ``` cpp
    m_screenParam.excludeWindowList = excludeViews;
    m_screenParam.excludeWindowCount = count;

    int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
    ```

#### Additional notes

On the Windows platform, you can block up to 24 windows.

### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Call `stopScreenCapture` to stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> within a channel. The sample code is as follows:

    ``` cpp
    // Stop screen sharing
    ret = m_rtcEngine->stopScreenCapture();
    ```

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- After turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the resolution of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as the billing standard. Please see [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details. The default resolution is 1280 × 720, but you can adjust it according to your business needs.
- To share 4K resolution Ultra-HD video during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, your device needs to meet certain requirements. The minimum device specifications recommended by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> are: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHZ.
