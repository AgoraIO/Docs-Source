### Install required library through `vcpkg`

You can also install required library & Packages using vcpkg package manager by following these steps:

**Install vcpkg** by following the instructions on the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where vcpkg was installed.

Run the following commands 


1. vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows   // to install OpenSsl (for libssl.lib and libcrypto.lib)
2. vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows      // to install zlib  (zlib.lib)
Note: x64-windows is for 64-bit version of Windows. For 32-bit version, use x86-windows instead.

3. Once the installation is complete, open your Visual Studio project.
Right-click on the project name in the Solution Explorer and select "Properties" from the context menu.
In the Property Pages, select "VC++ Directories" from the left-hand side menu.
Add the path to the vcpkg "installed" directory to the "Include Directories" field.
For example, if vcpkg is installed in C:\vcpkg, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the include directory would be C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include\

4. In the same Property Pages, select "Linker" from the left-hand side menu.
Add the path to the vcpkg "installed" directory to the "Library Directories" field.
For example, if vcpkg is installed in C:\vcpkg, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the library directory would be C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib.

5. In the same Property Pages, select "Input" from the left-hand side menu.
Add zlib.lib,libssl.lib and libcrypto.lib to the "Additional Dependencies" field.


6. Add Dlls:  
Add the directory containing the DLLs(libssl-3-x64.dll,libcrypto-3-x64.dll and zlib1.dll) files to the project's properties:
Open the project's properties by right-clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting Properties.
Navigate to Configuration Properties -> Debugging.
Add the directory containing the Dlls file (vcpkg installed path  bin directory like "C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin")to the "Environment" property.

    **Note** : If the above adding path for Dlls doesn't work for you then you can copy the require DLLs (libssl-3-x64.dll,libcrypto-3-x64.dll and zlib1.dll) from  vcpkg installed path  bin directory like "C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin"  to your project debug folder (like your project\x64\Debug)

Save your changes and rebuild your project.
