## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the overall technical architecture of <Vg k="FC"/>:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

The source code of <Vg k="FC"/> contains the following packages:

- `agora-classroom-sdk`: The <Vg k="ACS"/>, which contains the following modules:
    - `/lib/externals`: Stores video-related extensions such as beautifying and noise reduction.
    - `/src/infra/api`: SDK interface.
    - `/src/infra/configs`: Default color and theme configuration.
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
    - `/src/infra/capabilities`:
        - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
        - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.
    - `/src/ui-kit`: Common UI components.
- `agora-demo-app`: The <Vg k="ACS"/> demo app, supports Web, H5, Electron and other platforms, supports online classroom, online invigilation function, and provides code samples for online classroom before, during, and after class.

- `agora-plugin-gallery`: An independent plug-in library for <Vg k="ACS"/>, which inherits the `AgoraWidgetBase` class and implements the `AgoraWidgetLifecycle` interface. It includes plug-ins such as interactive whiteboard, IM chat, answering machine, voting machine, and timer.

- `agora-proctor-sdk`: The Agora Classroom invigilation scene SDK, including the following modules:
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
    - `/src/infra/capabilities`:
         - `/components`: Common UI components.
         - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
         - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.

- `agora-common-libs`: General tool class library, including ThemeProvider, I18nProvider, and other global general tools

- `agora-edu-core`: Provides upstream API calls and downstream data structure encapsulation for education and proctoring scenarios in smart classrooms.

- `agora-rte-sdk`: Provides cross-end RTC adaptation capabilities as well as classroom event callbacks and data structure encapsulation.

## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> into your web project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-classroom-sdk) or CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13) on GitHub.

## Integrated education scenario

<a name="default_ui_education"></a>
### Use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>

If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through npm or CDN.

#### Through npm

1. To install the SDK, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install agora-classroom-sdk
    ```

2. To import the `AgoraEduSDK` module, add the following code in the Javascript code in your project.

    ```
    import {AgoraEduSDK} from 'agora-classroom-sdk'
    ```

3. To launch a classroom, call [AgoraEduSDK.config](../../reference/classroom-sdk#config) and [AgoraEduSDK.launch](../../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

   <Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">Flexible Classroom's dependency `agora-electron-sdk` contains the native Node.js module. It is not recommended to use webpack and other construction tools for secondary compilation; otherwise, there may be an error that the Node.js module cannot be found. It is recommended to set these two libraries as external dependencies in the project configuration. For example: `externals: {'agora-electron-sdk': 'commonjs2 agora-electron-sdk'}`.    </Admonition>

#### Through CDN

1. Add the following code to the HTML file in your project:

    ```html
    <!-- Replace X.Y.Z with the Flexible Classroom version number, such as 2.9.0.
    You can check the latest version number through the release notes or GitHub repository branch. -->
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@X.Y.Z.bundle.js"></script>
    ```

2. To launch a classroom, call [AgoraEduSDK.config](../../reference/classroom-sdk#config) and [AgoraEduSDK.launch](../../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what a <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purposes, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server. The generated token passed in `userId` must be consistent with the `userUuid` parameters passed in the `launch` method; otherwise, the generated token will be invalid.

For details on the values of other parameters, see [LaunchOption](../../reference/classroom-sdk#launchoption).

When being proctored online, students need to use the primary and secondary devices to access the exam. For example, the main device is a Web client used to collect students' videos and share their screens when they answer questions; the secondary device is an Android or iOS device used to capture students' bodies when they answer questions. The proctor observes students answering questions through videos from several points to prevent cheating. You need to fill in the `userUuid` on different devices. For example, for student A, pass it in the `AgoraProctorSDK.launch` parameter on the Web side, and then on the Android or iOS side. Flexible Classroom will identify them as student A's primary and secondary devices, merge their video streams, and render the merged video images in the teacher's proctoring video window.

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what a <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purposes, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.  The generated token passed in `userId` must be consistent with the `launch` parameters passed in the `userUuid` method; otherwise, the generated token will be invalid.

For details on the values of other parameters, see [LaunchOption](../../reference/classroom-sdk#launchoption).

### Set exam link

After the online exam starts, candidates will load the exam papers locally through the created Webview window. The link to the exam paper is set through the `examinationUrl` field in the room properties (`roomProperties`). You can set the exam paper link as follows:

- When creating a room: Call the create classroom properties interface of the RESTful API to create a class, and set the `examinationUrl` field in the request package body.

    ```json
    {
      "roomName": "jasoncai61734",
      "roomType": 4,
      "roomProperties": {
        "schedule": {
          "startTime": 1655452800000,
          "duration": 600,
          "closeDelay": 0
        },
        // Set the exam paper link for this exam
        "examinationUrl": "your examination url"
      }
    }
    ```

- After creating a room: Call the update classroom attribute interface of the RESTful API, and set the `examinationUrl` field in the request package body.

    ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        // Set the exam paper link for this exam
        "examinationUrl": "your examination url"
      },
      "cause": {}
    }
    ```
