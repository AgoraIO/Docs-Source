A growing number of electronic devices support simultaneous network access through multiple connections, such as Wi-Fi and cellular, or Wi-Fi and dual-SIM cellular. Each connection is independent of the actual network transmission path and does not share bandwidth bottlenecks.

This page explains how to implement multipath network transmission in your project.

## Understand the tech

Starting with v4.6.0, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> adds a new network transmission feature called Multipath. This feature is designed for devices that support multiple network interfaces, including 5G, Wi-Fi, and LAN. Multipath helps reduce or even eliminate poor user experiences caused by weak network conditions. In lab tests, under weak network conditions with frequent bandwidth jitter, enabling Multipath reduces lag by more than 50% while maintaining image quality and latency.

Multipath improves real-time audio and video experiences that require stable transmission in poor network conditions, including video conferencing, online education, IoT parallel operations, and remote production and broadcasting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<PlatformWrapper platform="android">
- A mobile device running Android 7.0 (API level 24) or later, with two or more active network connections.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="windows">
- A Windows device running Vista or later, with two or more active network interfaces (such as Wi-Fi and Ethernet).
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios, macos">
- Mobile device running iOS 12.0 or later, with two or more active network connections.
</PlatformWrapper>

- Basic audio and video interaction functions implemented in your project. See [<Vpd k="NAME" /> Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk).
