To manage audio mixing and voice effects, <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides the following APIs:

| Function | Sound effect | Audio mixing |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Play or stop playing a specific audio file     | `preloadEffect`<br/> `unloadEffect`<br/> `playEffect`<br/> `stopEffect`<br/> `stopAllEffects`  | `startAudioMixing`<br/> `stopAudioMixing`       |
| Pause or resume playing an audio file          | `pauseEffect`<br/> `pauseAllEffects`<br/> `resumeEffect`<br/> `resumeAllEffects` | `pauseAudioMixing`<br/> `resumeAudioMixing`    |
| Get and adjust playback position and volume   | `setEffectPosition`<br/> `getEffectCurrentPosition`<br/> `getEffectsVolume`<br/> `setEffectsVolume`<br/> `setVolumeOfEffect` | `getAudioMixingCurrentPosition`<br/> `setAudioMixingPosition`<br/> `getAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `getAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume` |
| Report playback status of audio files          | `onAudioEffectFinished`                       | `onAudioMixingStateChanged`                    |

### Set up file access permissions 
For Android projects with `targetSdkVersion` greater than or equal to 20, add the following to the project's `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
    <application>
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
        android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    </application>
    ```

### Play sound effects

To play sound effects, refer to the following code example:

    ```java
    //Import the IAudioEffectManger class
    import io.agora.rtc.IAudioEffectManager;

    // Call getAudioEffectManager to get the IAudioEffectManager class
    private IAudioEffectManager audioEffectManager;
    audioEffectManager = mRtcEngine.getAudioEffectManager();

    // Set the sound effect ID as a unique identifier for identifying sound effect files
    int id = 0;
    // If you want to play the sound effect repeatedly, you can preload the file into memory
    // If the file is large, do not preload it
    // You can only preload local sound effect files
    audioEffectManager.preloadEffect(id++, "Your file path");

    // Call playEffect to play the specified sound effect file
    // Call playEffect multiple times, set multiple sound effect IDs, and play multiple sound effect files at the same time
    audioEffectManager.playEffect(
        0,    // Set the sound effect ID
        "Your file path",   // Set the sound effect file path
        -1,   // Set the number of times the sound effect loops. -1 means infinite loop
        1,    // Set the tone of the sound effect. 1 represents the original pitch
        0.0,  // Set the spatial position of the sound effect. 0.0 means the sound effect appears directly in front
        100,  // Set the sound effect volume. 100 represents the original volume
        true, // Set whether to publish sound effects to the remote end
        0     // Set the playback position of the sound effect file (in ms). 0 means start at the beginning
    );

    // Pause or resume playing the specified sound effect file
    audioEffectManager.pauseEffect(id);
    audioEffectManager.resumeEffect(id);

    // Set the playback position of the specified local sound effect file
    audioEffectManager.setEffectPosition(id, 500);

    // Set the playback volume of all sound effect files
    audioEffectManager.setEffectsVolume(50.0);
    // Set the playback volume of the specified sound effect file
    audioEffectManager.setVolumeOfEffect(id, 50.0);

    // Release the preloaded sound effect file
    audioEffectManager.unloadEffect(id);
    // Stop playing all sound effect files
    audioEffectManager.stopAllEffects;

    @Override
    // This callback is triggered when the sound effect file ends playing
    public void onAudioEffectFinished(int soundId) {
        super.onAudioEffectFinished(soundId);
    }
    ```

### Incorporate audio mixing

Before or after joining a channel, call `startAudioMixing` to play the audio file. When the audio mixing status changes, the SDK triggers the `onAudioMixingStateChanged` callback and reports the reason for the change. 

To mix in an audio file, refer to the following code example:

    ```java
    // Start playing a music file
    mRtcEngine.startAudioMixing(
        "Your file path",  // Specify the path of the local or online music file
        false,             // Set whether to play the music file only locally. false means both local and remote users can hear the music
        false,             // Set whether to replace the audio collected by the microphone with the music file. false means users can hear both music and microphone-collected audio
        -1                 // Set the number of times the music file should be played. -1 indicates infinite loop
    );
    
    @Override
    // Triggered when the playback state of the music file changes
    // After receiving the onAudioMixingStateChanged callback, call other mixing APIs, such as pauseAudioMixing or getAudioMixingDuration
    public void onAudioMixingStateChanged(int state, int errorCode) {
        super.onAudioMixingStateChanged(state, errorCode);
    }
    
    // Pause or resume playing the music file
    rtcEngine.pauseAudioMixing();
    rtcEngine.resumeAudioMixing();
    
    // Get the total duration of the current music file
    rtcEngine.getAudioMixingDuration();
    // Set the playback position of the current music file. 500 indicates starting playback from the 500th ms of the music file
    rtcEngine.setAudioMixingPosition(500);
    
    // Adjust the playback volume of the current music file for remote users
    rtcEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(50);
    // Adjust the playback volume of the current music file locally
    rtcEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(50);
    ```

Control playback using the following methods:

- `pauseAudioMixing`: Pause playback.
- `resumeAudioMixing`: Resume playback.
- `stopAudioMixing`: Stop playing.
- `setAudioMixingPosition`: Set the playing position of the current audio file.
- `adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`: Adjust the volume of the current audio file played locally.
- `adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`: Adjust the volume of the current audio file played at the remote end.
