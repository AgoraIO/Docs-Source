### Create and destroy a chat group

Users can create a chat group and set the chat group attributes such as the name, description, group members, and reasons for creating the group. Users can also specify the size and type of a chat group. Once a chat group is created, the creator of the chat group automatically becomes the chat group owner.

Only chat group owners can disband chat groups. Once a chat group is disbanded, all members of that chat group are immediately removed from the chat group. All local data for the chat group is also removed from the database and memory.

Refer to the following sample code to create and destroy a chat group:

```objc
AgoraChatGroupOptions *options = [[AgoraChatGroupOptions alloc] init];
// Set the size of a chat group.
options.maxUsersCount = self.maxMemNum;
// Set IsInviteNeedConfirm to YES to send a group invitation to invitees. If IsInviteNeedConfrim is set to NO, invitees are added to the chat group automatically without their confirmations.
options.IsInviteNeedConfirm = YES;
// Set the type of a chat group to private. Allow chat group members to invite other users to join the group.
options.style = AgoraChatGroupStylePrivateMemberCanInvite;
NSArray *members = @{@"memeber1",@"member2"};
// Call createGroupWithSubject to create a chat group.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager createGroupWithSubject:@"subject"
                                                                                                                 description:@"description"
                                                                                                                      invitees:members
                                                                                                                         message:@"message"
                                                                                                                         setting:options
                                                                                                                             error:nil];


// Call destroyGroup to disband a chat group. Once a chat group is disbanded, all chat group members receive the `userDidLeaveGroup` callback.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager destroyGroup:@"groupID"];
```

### Join and leave a chat group

Users can request to join a public chat group as follows:

1. Call `getPublicGroupsFromServerWithCursor` to retrieve the list of public groups by page. Users can obtain the ID of the group that they want to join.
2. Call `joinPublicGroup` to send a join request to the chat group:
    - If the type of the chat group is set to `AgoraChatGroupStylePublicOpenJoin`, the request from the user is accepted automatically and the chat group members receive the `userDidJoinGroup` callback.
    - If the type of the chat group is set to `AgoraChatGroupStylePublicJoinNeedApproval`, the chat group owner and chat group admins receive the `joinGroupRequestDidReceive` callback and determine whether to accept the request from the user. Once the join request is approved, the user receives the `joinGroupRequestDidApprove` callback. Otherwise, the user receives the `joinGroupRequestDidDecline` callback.

Users can call `leaveGroup` to leave a chat group. Once a user leaves the chat group, all the other group members receive the `userDidLeaveGroup` callback.

Refer to the following sample code to join and leave a chat group:

```objc
// Call getPublicGroupsFromServerWithCursor to retrieve the list of public groups by page.
NSMutableArray *memberList = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
NSInteger pageSize = 50;
NSString *cursor = nil;
AgoraChatCursorResult *result = [[AgoraChatCursorResult alloc]init];
do {
  result = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager
            			 getPublicGroupsFromServerWithCursor:cursor
            																	pageSize:50 
            																		 error:nil];
  [memberList addObjectsFromArray:result.list];
  cursor = result.cursor;
} while (result && result.list < pageSize);

// Call joinPublicGroup to send a join request to a chat group.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager joinPublicGroup:@"groupID" error:nil];

// Call leaveGroup to leave a chat group.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager leaveGroup:@"groupID" error:nil];
```

### Retrieve the member list of a chat group

- When a group has less than 200 members, you can call the `getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId` method to retrieve the group member list that contains the group owner, admins, and regular members.

```objc
// If `true` is passed to the second parameter, the SDK returns the group member list that contains up to 200 group members.
// It is a synchronous method. The asynchronous method is [AgoraChatGroupManager getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId:fetchMembers:completion:].
AgoraChatGroup *group = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager
                                          getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId:@"groupID"
                                          fetchMembers:YES
                                          error:nil];
NSArray *memberList = group.memberList;
```

- When a group has more than 200 members, you can first call the `getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId` method to get the group member list that contains the group owner and admins and then call the `getGroupMemberListFromServerWithId` method to obtain the list of regular group members.

```objc
AgoraChatGroup *group = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager
                                          getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId:@"groupID"
                                          fetchMembers:NO
                                          error:nil];
NSMutableArray *memberList = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
NSInteger pageSize = 50;
NSString *cursor = nil;
AgoraChatCursorResult *result = [[AgoraChatCursorResult alloc]init];
do {
  // It is a synchronous method. The asynchronous method is [AgoraChatGroupManager getGroupMemberListFromServerWithId:cursor:pageSize:completion:].
    result = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager
                                      getGroupMemberListFromServerWithId:@"groupID"
                                      cursor:cursor
                                      pageSize:pageSize
                                      error:nil];
    [memberList addObjectsFromArray:result.list];
    cursor = result.cursor;
} while (result && result.list < pageSize);
```

### Block and unblock a chat group

All chat group members can block and unblock a chat group. Once members block a chat group, they no longer receive messages from this chat group.

Refer to the following sample code to block and unblock a chat group:

```objc
// Call blockGroup to block a chat group.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager blockGroup:@"groupID"error:nil];

// Call unblockGroup to unblock a chat group.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager unblockGroup:@"groupID" error:nil];
```

The chat group owner and chat group admins can call `getGroupSpecificationFromServerWithId` to retrieve the member list of a chat group and call `isBlocked` to further retrieve the list of members who block the chat group.  
Chat group members can call `isBlocked` to check whether they block the chat group.

### Listen for chat group events

To monitor the chat group events, users can listen for the callbacks in the `AgoraChatGroupManager` class and add app logics accordingly. If a user wants to stop listening for the callbacks, make sure that the user removes the listener to prevent memory leakage.

```objc
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager addDelegate:self delegateQueue:nil];
}

- (void)dealloc
{
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].groupManager removeDelegate:self];
}
```

```objc
// Occurs when a user receives a group invitation.
- (void)groupInvitationDidReceive:(NSString *)aGroupId inviter:(NSString *)aInviter message:(NSString *)aMessage

// Occurs when the chat group owner receives a join request.
- (void)joinGroupRequestDidReceive:(AgoraChatGroup *)aGroup user:(NSString *)aUsername reason:(NSString *)aReason
