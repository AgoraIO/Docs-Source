**Agora charges additionally for this extension. See [Pricing](/realtime-communication/overview/pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).**

### v1.1.0

#### Improvement

This release improves the calculation performance of the AI-powered noise suppression algorithm.

#### New features

This release adds the following APIs and parameters:

- **APIs**:
    - `checkCompatibility`: Checks whether the AI Noise Suppression extension is supported on the current browser.
    - `setMode`: Sets the noise suppression mode as AI noise suppression or stationary noise suppression.
    - `setLevel`: Sets the AI noise suppression level.
- **Parameters**:
    - `elapsedTime` in `onoverload`: Reports the time in ms that the extension needs to process one audio frame.

For API details, see [AI Noise Suppression](/realtime-communication/advanced-features/ai-noise-suppression).

#### Compatibility changes

This release brings the following changes:

- AI Noise Suppression supports Agora Video SDK for Web v4.15.0 or later.
- The extension has Wasm dependencies only. Because JS dependencies are removed, you need to publish the Wasm files located in the `node_modules/agora-extension-ai-denoiser/external` directory again. If you have enabled the Content Security Policy (CSP), you need to modify the CSP configuration. See [AI Noise Suppression](/realtime-communication/advanced-features/ai-noise-suppression) for details.
- The audio data is dumped in PCM format instead of WAV format.
- To adjust the intensity of noise suppression, best practice is to call `setLevel`.

### v1.0.0
