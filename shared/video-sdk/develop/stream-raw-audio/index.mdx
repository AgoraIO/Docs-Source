This article introduces how to preprocess and postprocess collected raw audio data.

## Understand the tech
During the audio transmission process, we can preprocess and postprocess the collected audio data to achieve the desired playback effect.

For scenarios that require self-processing of audio data, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> provides raw data functionality. You can perform pre-processing to modify the captured audio signal before sending the data to the encoder, or you can perform post-processing to modify the received audio signal after sending the data to the decoder.

<PlatformWrapper platform={['ios','macos']}>
### Data processing
The diagram below shows the data transmission process during the preprocessing and postprocessing of raw audio data:
![RawAudioProcessing](/images/video-sdk/raw-audio-processing-dataTransmission-temp.png)
Through the `onRecordAudioFrame`, `onPlaybackAudioFrame`, `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing`, or `onMixedAudioFrame` callbacks, you can:

    - Obtain raw audio frames.
    - Process the raw data and return it to the SDK.
</PlatformWrapper>

To implement processing of raw audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps.

- Register an instance of the audio frame observer before joining a channel.
- Set the format of audio frames captured by each callback.
- Implement callbacks in the frame observers to process raw audio data.
- Unregister the frame observers before you leave a channel.

The following figure shows the basic process of using raw audio data:

<Admonition title="PRECATION" type="caution">
The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Real-Time Interactive  <Vpd k="SDK"/> uses a synchronous callback mechanism for raw audio data. When you need to save or rewrite the raw audio data, please consider the following suggestions:

    - To ensure the continuity of the audio stream, do not block the SDK thread. It is advised not to process the data directly in the callback function. Instead, you should first make a deep copy of the received audio data and then transfer the copied data to another thread for processing.

    - If you decide to process the audio data synchronously within the callback function, please strictly control the processing time. For example, if the callback function is triggered every 10 milliseconds, then the processing time within the callback must be less than 10 milliseconds to prevent delays or interruptions in the audio stream.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites
- Before proceeding, ensure that you have implemented basic real-time audio and video functionality in your project i.e. you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.
