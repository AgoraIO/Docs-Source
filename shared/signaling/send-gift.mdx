To add more fun, you can enable virtual gift sending with the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />. An audience member can send virtual gifts to the host. All members in the live streaming room can see the gift.

## Implementation

Before proceeding, ensure that you have integrated the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> into your project. To learn more about integration, refer to the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk).

The basic API call sequence is as follows:

![1595560205836](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1595560205836)

The steps are as follows:

1.  The client calls <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_client.html#a729079805644b3307297fb2e902ab4c9">sendMessageToPeer</Link> to send a peer-to-peer message (gift type) to the server.

2.  The server checks the messages and calls `sendMessageToPeer` to send a peer-to-peer message (gift type) to the client.

3.  The client receives the peer-to-peer message and calls <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_channel.html#a57087adf4227a17c774ea292840148a0">sendMessage</Link> to send a channel message to all members in the room as a gift. The client renders the gift per the channel message.

4.  The client calls `sendMessageToPeer` to notify the server that the channel message is sent after receiving <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/interfaceio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_result_callback.html#a7206b30500655c4a73d146acf50cb6f5">onSuccess</Link>. You can add more code logic to ensure that the channel message is successfully sent. In the code logic, the server notifies the client to resend the channel message if the server did not receive <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/interfaceio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_client_listener.html?_ga=2.40828960.36209356.1595832008-73063204.1585890674#af760814981718fb31d88acb8251d19b6">onMessageReceived</Link> in time.

To ensure data security, Agora recommends that you encrypt all messages between the client and the server.
