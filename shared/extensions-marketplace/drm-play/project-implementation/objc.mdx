1. **Integrate <Vg k="RTEE_DRM" /> into your app**

   To add the <Vg k="RTEE_DRM_FRAMEWORK" /> library, add the following to the top of the `ViewController` class:

   ```swift
   let amccConfig = AgoraMusicContentCenterConfig()
   var amcc: AgoraMusicContentCenter!
   ```

2. **Initialize variables to set <Vg k="RTEE_DRM" /> configurations**

    Add the following line in `initializeAgoraEngine` after `config.appId = appID`:

    ```swift
    amcc = AgoraMusicContentCenter.sharedContentCenter(with: amccConfig)
    ```

3. **Add media player to play copyright music**

    To create a player that adds DRM-related modules on the basis of AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol, do the following:

    1. Add a variable to hold the music player to the top of the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    var musicPlayer: AgoraMusicPlayerProtocol!
    ```

    2. To initialize the music player, add the following code to `initializeAgoraEngine` after `amcc = AgoraMusicContentCenter.sharedContentCenter(with: amccConfig)`:

    ```swift
    musicPlayer = amcc?.createMusicPlayer(with:self as! AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate)
    ```
