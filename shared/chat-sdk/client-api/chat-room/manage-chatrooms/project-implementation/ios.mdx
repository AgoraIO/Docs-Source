### Create and destroy a chat room

The [app super admin](/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatroom-admins) can create a chat room and set the chat room attributes such as the chat room subject, description, and the maximum number of members. Once a chat room is created, the super admin automatically becomes the chat room owner.

<Admonition type="info">You are advised to call the [RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatrooms#creating-a-chat-room) to create a chat room from the server.</Admonition>

Only the chat room owner can disband a chat room. Once a chat room is disbanded, all the chat room members receive the `didDismissFromChatroom` callback and are immediately removed from the chat room.

```objc
// The super admin can call createChatroomWithSubject to create a chat room.
AgoraChatError *error = nil;
AgoraChatroom *retChatroom = [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager createChatroomWithSubject:@"aSubject" description:@"aDescription" invitees:@[@"user1",@"user2"]message:@"aMessage" maxMembersCount:aMaxMembersCount error:&error];
// The chat room owner can call destroyChatroom to disband a chat room.
AgoraChatError *error = nil;
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager destroyChatroom:self.chatroom.chatroomId error:&error];
```


### Join and leave a chat room

All chat users can call `joinChatroom` to join the specified chat room. Once a chat user joins a chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `userDidJoinChatroom` callback.

All chat room members can call `leaveChatroom` to leave the specified chat room. Once a chat room member leaves a chat room, all the other members receive the `userDidLeaveChatroom` callback and all the local data is deleted by default. To retain data on the local device, set the `isDeleteMessagesWhenExitChatRoom` parameter of `AgoraChatOptions` to `NO`.

```objc
// All chat users can call joinChatroom to join the specified chat room.
AgoraChatError *error = nil;
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager joinChatroom:@"aChatroomId" error:&error]; 

// All chat room members can call leaveChatroom to leave the specified chat room.
AgoraChatError *error = nil;
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager leaveChatroom:@"aChatroomId" error:&error];
```
If a chat room member is offline for more than two minutes, they are automatically logged out due to network conditions or other factors. To adjust this timeout, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

    The following members are not removed from the chat room, even if they are offline:

    - **Whitelisted members** : Chat room owners and administrators are whitelisted by default.
    - **Users added via the RESTful API**: If a user is added when [creating a chat room](#create-and-destroy-a-chat-room) using the RESTful API and has never logged in, they are not removed.


### Retrieve the chat room list and attributes

All chat users can get the chat room list from the server and retrieve the basic information of the specified chat room using the chat room ID.

```objc
// Chat room members can call getChatroomsFromServerWithPage to retrieve the specified number of chat rooms from the server by page. The maximum value of pageSize is 1,000.
AgoraChatError *error = nil;
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager getChatroomsFromServerWithPage:1 pageSize:50 error:&error];
														
// Chat room members can call chatroomWithId to get the basic information of the specified chat room by passing the chat room ID.
AgoraChatroom *chatRoom = [AgoraChatroom chatroomWithId:@"chatroomId"];
```


### Listen for chat room events

To monitor the chat room events, you can listen for the callbacks in the `ChatRoomManager` class and add app logics accordingly. If you want to stop listening for the callback, make sure that you remove the listener to prevent memory leakage.

```objc
// Listen for the callback.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager addDelegate:self delegateQueue:nil];

// Stop listening for the callback.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].roomManager removeDelegate:self];
```

### Update the chat room member count in real time

If many members join or leave a chat room in a very short time, you can update the chat room member count in real time:

1. When a user joins a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `userDidJoinChatroom:user:` event. When a member leaves or is removed from a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `userDidLeaveChatroom:user:` event.

2. After the event is received, you can call the `occupantsCount` method to get the current number of members in the chat room.

```objc
extension ViewController: AgoraChatroomManagerDelegate {
  func userDidJoin(_ aChatroom: AgoraChatroom, user aUsername: String) {
    let memberCount = aChatroom.occupantsCount
  }
  func userDidLeave(_ aChatroom: AgoraChatroom, user aUsername: String) {
    let memberCount = aChatroom.occupantsCount
  }
}

AgoraChatClient.shared().roomManager?.add(self, delegateQueue: nil)
```
