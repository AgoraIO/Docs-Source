To meet the laws and regulations of different countries or regions, the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> supports geofencing. After enabling geofencing, the SDK only connects to Agora servers within the specified region, regardless of where your app users are located.

For example, if you specify North America as the region for connection, when two users attempt to connect to Agora servers from different locations, the result is as follows:


<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-ln2d">Specified region for connection</th>
    <th class="tg-ln2d">App user location</th>
    <th class="tg-ln2d">Actual region for connection </th>
		<th class="tg-ln2d">User experience after connection </th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">North America</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">North America</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">North America</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">Normal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">North America</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">China</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">North America</td>
    <td class="tg-6yr1">There may be a significant impact on user experience. Due to the cross-region public Internet between the designated area and the area where the app user is located, poor quality of the public Internet network affects the audio and video experience.<p/>If the servers in the specified area are not available, the SDK reports an error directly. </td>
  </tr>

Restricted media zones is an advanced feature of the SDK. Use it only when required for scenarios with access security restrictions.

## Implementation

When you specify an access area, audio, video and message data is not accessed from servers outside the specified area.
