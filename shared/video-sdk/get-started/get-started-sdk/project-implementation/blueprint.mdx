### Implement basic processes​
In the **My Blueprint** panel, double-click **Graphs > EventGraph** to open the event graph. You see two event nodes: **Event BeginPlay** (game starts) and **Event End Play** (game ends). Create event nodes with the corresponding functions and variables, and connect them as shown in the following figure to implement the <Vpd k="NAME" /> logic:

![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-2.png)

The following table lists the main nodes:

| # | Node | Type | Description |
|:--|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 1 | **Set Show Mouse Cursor** | Native* | (Optional) Set whether to display the mouse cursor. Check to display it. <Admonition type="info" title="Information"><ul><li>This node is available on Windows and macOS only.</li><li>If the node is not retrieved at creation time, uncheck **Context Sensitive**.</li></ul> ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-3.png) </Admonition> |
| 2 | **Load Agora Config** | Custom** | Loads Agora configuration. Used to verify user identity when creating and joining channels. |
| 3 | **Create BP Video Widget** | Native | Create user interface: <ol><li>Add **Create Widget** node.</li><li>Select the node's **Class** as **BP_VideoWidget** and associate the node with the already created user interface.</li></ol> |
| 4 | **Set Basic Video Call Widget** | Custom | Set up the user interface:<ol><li>Create the **BasicVideoCallWidget** variable and select the **Variable Type** of the variable as **BP_VideoWidget**, which is the user interface created to store a reference to the user interface in the blueprint.</li><li>After dragging the created variables to **EventGraph**, two options, **Set BasicVideoCallWidget** and **Get BasicVideoCallWidget**, appear. Select **Set BasicVideoCallWidget** to create a node for accessing and setting the user interface.</li></ol> |
| 5 | **BindUIEvent** | Custom | Use Bind UI events to handle event logic after clicking the **Join Channel** and **Leave Channel** buttons. |

| 7 | **Check Permission** | Custom | (Optional) Check whether you have obtained the system permissions required for real-time audio and video interaction, such as access to the camera and microphone. <Admonition type="caution" title="Note">If your target platform is Android, create this node to check system permissions. </Admonition> |
| 8 | **Init Rtc Engine** | Custom | Create and initialize the RTC engine. |
| 9 | **Un Init Rtc Engine** | Custom | Leave the channel and release resources. |

\* Native nodes are nodes that come with the blueprint and can be added and called directly.<br/>
\** Custom nodes are not included in the blueprint. You create a custom function before you can add the corresponding node.

### Add channel-related variables​
Add variables to create an engine instance and join a channel.

1. Create three variables: 

    **Token**, **ChannelId**, and **AppId**. Select the **Variable Type** as **String**.

1. In the **Load Agora Config** function, add the **Sequence** node, and then connect **Set Token**, **Set Channel Id**, and **Set App Id** respectively. Fill in the token, channel name, and app ID values obtained from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

### Initialize RTC engine​

1. If your target platform is Android, check whether system permissions have been granted before initializing the RTC engine. Refer to the following figure to create nodes for adding permissions to access the microphone and camera in the **CheckPermission** function.

    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-5.png)

    <Admonition type="info" title="Information">If your target platform is macOS or iOS, please refer to [How do I add the permissions needed for real-time interaction to my Unreal Engine project?](/help/integration-issues/unreal_permissions)</Admonition>

1. To initialize the RTC engine, in the **InitRtcEngine** function, create and connect nodes as shown in the following figure:

    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-6.png)

  1. Create `IRtcEngine` and `IRtcEngineEventHandler`.

        1. To store references to the engine and event-handler interface classes, create `RtcEngine` and `EventHandler` variables, and set the **Variable Type** to **Agora Rtc Engine** and **IRtc Engine Event Handler**, respectively.

        1. Add two **Construct Object From Class nodes**, set **Class** to **Agora Rtc Engine** and **IRtc Engine Event Handler** respectively. Connect to **Set Rtc Engine** and **Set Event Handler**, respectively.

    1.  Bind `IRtcEngineEventHandler` class-related callback functions.

        1. Create `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined`, and `onUserOffline` callback functions. Refer to the following table to configure the input parameters of the callbacks:

            | Callback | Description | Input parameters |
            |:--------|:------------------|:------------|
            | `FOnJoinChannelSuccess` | The local user successfully joined a channel. | <ul><li>`channel`: (String) Channel name.</li><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The ID of the user joining the channel.</li><li>`elapsed`: (Integer) The time (in milliseconds) that elapsed from the local call to `JoinChannel` till the occurrence of this event.</li></ul> |
            | `FOnLeaveChannel` | The local user left the channel. | <ul><li>`stats`: Call statistics.</li></ul> |
            | `FOnUserJoined` | A remote user joined the current channel. | <ul><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The user ID of the remote user joining the channel.</li><li>`elapsed`: (Integer) The time (in milliseconds) that elapsed from the local call to `JoinChannel` till the occurrence of this event.</li></ul> |
            | `FOnUserOffline` | A remote user left the current channel. | <ul><li>`uid`: (Integer64) The ID of the user going offline.</li><li>`reason`: Offline reason. For details, see  `EUSER_OFFLINE_REASON_TYPE`.</li></ul> |

        1. Create a **Bind Event** function. In this function, add a **Sequence** node, and then bind the `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined`, and `onUserOffline` callback events.

            ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-7.png)

    1. `IRtcEngine` initialization

        1. Call **Initialize** to initialize the RTC engine.       
        2. Connect to the **RtcEngineContext** configuration `IRtcEngine` instance and select **Channel Profile** as `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING`.
        

### Bind UI events​

To bind UI events:

1. Create and implement the `OnJoinChannelClicked` event callback.

    ![Join Channel Clicked](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-8.png)
    
    1. Call **Enable Video** and **Enable Audio** to enable the video and audio modules.
    2. Call **Join Channel** to join the channel.
    3. Set the following parameters in **Make ChannelMediaOptions**:
        - Set **Publish Camera Track** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the video stream recorded by the camera.
        - Set **Publish Microphone Track** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the audio stream recorded by the microphone.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Video** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all video streams.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Audio** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all audio streams.
        - Check **Client Role Type Set Value** and set **Client Role Type** to `CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER` or `CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE`, to set the user role to host or audience.
        - Check **Channel Profile Set Value** and set **Channel Profile** to `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING`.

1. Create and implement the `OnLeaveChannelClicked` event callback. When the event is triggered, call **Leave Channel** to leave the channel.

    ![Leave Channel Clicked](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-9.png)

1. In the **Bind UIEvent** function, refer to the figure below to bind the `OnJoinChannelClicked` and `OnLeaveChannelClicked` callback functions to the **Join Channel** and **Leave Channel** buttons respectively. When the button is clicked, the corresponding event callback is triggered.

    ![Bind Join Leave Callbacks](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-10.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">You can also bind UI events in Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG). This document only shows binding using the **Bind UIEvent Function**.</Admonition>

### Set up local and remote views​

1. Create and implement the **MakeVideoView** function to load the view when local or remote users join the channel:

    ![Implement Make Video View](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-11.png)

    1. In this function, create `SavedUID`, `SavedSourceType`, `SavedChannelID` local variables, set the **Variable Type** to `Integer64`, `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE`, and `String`, respectively. Save the variables for use when loading the view later.
    1. Create a local view. In the local view, if the UID is 0, a value is randomly assigned by the SDK, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_PRIMARY` (the first camera).
    1. Create a remote view. In the remote view, the `uid` is the uid sent from the remote end, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_REMOTE` (remote video obtained from the network).

2. Create and implement the **ReleaseVideoView** function to release the view when a local or remote user leaves the channel.

    ![Implement Release Video View](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-12.png)

    1. In this function, create `SavedUID`, `SavedSourceType`, and `SavedChannelID` local variables, set the **Variable Type** to `Integer64`, `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE`, and `String`, respectively. Save the variables for use when releasing the view later.
    1. Release the local view.
    1. Release the remote view.

### Implement callback function​

Configure the previously created `onJoinChannelSuccess`, `onLeaveChannel`, `onUserJoined`, and `onUserOffline` callback functions as follows:

1. After the local user successfully joins the channel, the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback is triggered and the local view is created. The `uid` is set to `0` by default, but it is assigned a random value by the SDK. The video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_PRIMARY` (first camera):

    ![Join Channel Success Callback](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-13.png)

2. After the local user leaves the channel, the `onLeaveChannel` callback is triggered which releases the local view:

    ![Leave Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-14.png)


3. When a remote user joins the channel, the `onUserJoined` callback is triggeredd to create a remote view. `uid` is the uid sent from the remote end, and the video source type is `VIDEO_SOURCE_REMOTE` (remote video obtained from the network):

    ![Remote User Join Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-15.png)

4. When a remote user leaves the channel, the `onUserOffline` callback is triggered to release the remote view:

    ![Remote User Leave Channel Callback](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-implementation-blueprint-16.png)

### Leave the channel and release resources​

To leave the channel, implement the following steps:

1. Leave the channel.
1. Unregister <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> event callback.
1. Destroy `IRtcEngineObject` to release all resources used by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK.

Refer to the figure below to implement the `UnInitRtcEngine` function:
