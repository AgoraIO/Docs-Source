| Single/multi-device login | Forced logout strategy |
|:---:|:---:|
| Single-device login | The newly logged-in device will force the current device to log out. The logged-out device will receive the `onDisconnected` event.|
| Multi-device login | If the number of logged-in devices on one end reaches the limit, the device that logged in the latest will force the device that logged in the earliest to log out. Agora Chat only supports forced logout for the devices on the same end. <br/>When multiple ends are logged in, the use of a fixed device ID affects the forced logout strategy. The SDK generates an ID as the unique device identifier. Previously, the SDK used a different random string as the device identifier for each opened tab. Starting from v1.3.1, the SDK has the `ConnectionParameters#isFixedDeviceId` parameter, which you can set to use a random device ID or a fixed device ID when initializing the SDK: <br/>- (Default) `true`: Use a fixed device ID. The device ID is stored in local storage. Even when multiple devices are logged in, only one tab can be opened in the same browser. If two are opened, the new tab will force the previous one offline. <br/>- `false`: Use a random device ID. Each tab uses a different device ID. When logging in with multiple devices, a user can open multiple tabs in the same browser. If the number of devices exceeds the set number, the newly opened tab will force the first opened tab offline. |

The Agora server provides a RESTful interface to force a specified account to [log out from a single device](../restful-api/user-system-registration#forcing-a-user-offline).
