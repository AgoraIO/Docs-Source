1.  In the sample code, set the variables `appId`, and `appCertificate` to values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2.  Set `channelName` and `expirationTimeInSeconds` to the name of the channel to join and the renew time for the token.

3.  For the purpose of this test, set `uid` equal to zero.

4.  Build and run the project

    The code generates two <Vpd k="NAME"/> tokens and prints them to the terminal. The first token is generated using an integer `uid` and the second token is generated using a `userAccount` string.

5.  Use the token to connect to a <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel

    1.  In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link>.

    2.  Fill in the *App ID*, and *Channel* with the same values that were used to call the token generation method.

    3.  Copy the <Vpd k="NAME"/> uid authentication token from the terminal and paste it into the demo page.

    4.  Press **Join** to connect.

        You see the local video on the screen.

6.  Connect to the same channel from another device to confirm that everything works.
