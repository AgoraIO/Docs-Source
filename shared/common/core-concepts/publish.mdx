#### Publish

Publishing is the act of sending a user’s audio or video data to the channel. Usually, the published stream is created by the audio data sampled from a microphone or the video data captured by a camera. You can also publish media streams from other sources, such as an online music file or the user’s screen.
After successfully publishing a stream, the SDK continues sending media data to other users in the channel. By publishing the local stream and subscribing to remote streams, users communicate with each other in real-time.
