To communicate securely between <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> and your webhook,  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />  uses signatures for identity verification as follows:

1. When you configure <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />,  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />  generates a secret you use for verification.
1. When sending a notification,  <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> generates two signature values from the secret using `HMAC/SHA1` and `HMAC/SHA256` algorithms. These signatures are added as `Agora-Signature` and `Agora-Signature-V2` to the `HTTPS` request header.
1. When your server receives a callback, you can verify `Agora-Signature` or `Agora-Signature-V2`: 

    * To verify `Agora-Signature`, use the secret, the raw request body, and the `crypto/sha1` algorithm. 
    * To verify `Agora-Signature-V2`, use the secret, the raw request body, and the `crypto/sha256` algorithm.
     
The following sample code uses `crypto/sha1`. 

To add signature verification to your server, take the following steps:

1. In the `main.go` file, replace your imports with with the following:
    
    ```go
    import (
        "crypto/hmac"
        "crypto/sha1"
        "encoding/hex"
        "encoding/json"
        "fmt"
        "io"
        "log"
        "net/http"	
    )
    ```

1. Add the following code after the list of imports:

    ```go
    // Replace with your NCS secret
    const secret = "<Replace with your secret code>"

    // calcSignatureV1 computes the HMAC/SHA256 signature for a given payload and secret
    func calcSignatureV1(secret, payload string) string {
        mac := hmac.New(sha1.New, []byte(secret))
        mac.Write([]byte(payload))
        return hex.EncodeToString(mac.Sum(nil))
    }

    // verify checks if the provided signature matches the HMAC/SHA256 signature of the request body
    func verify(requestBody, signature string) bool {
        calculatedSignature := calcSignatureV1(secret, requestBody)
        fmt.Println("Calculated Signature:", calculatedSignature)
        fmt.Println("Received Signature:", signature)
        return calculatedSignature == signature
    }
    ```

1. In `main.go`, add the following code after you read the request body:

    ```go
    // Verify the signature
    if !verify(string(body), agoraSignature) {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid signature", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        return
    }
    ```

1. To test the server, follow the steps given in the [Enable notifications](#enable-notifications) section.

1. When you receive an event from the console, and if the signature matches, the event details are displayed in your browser.
