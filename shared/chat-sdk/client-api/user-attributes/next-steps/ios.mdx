### Manage user avatar

The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> only supports storing the URL address of the avatar file rather than the file itself. To manage user avatars, you need to use a third-party file storage service.

To implement user avatar management in your app, take the following steps:

1. Upload the avatar file to the third-party file storage service. Once the file is successfully uploaded, you get a URL address of the avatar file.
2. Set the `avatarUrl` parameter in user attributes as the URL address of the avatar file.
3. To display the avatar, call `fetchUserInfoById` to retrieve the URL of the avatar file, and then render the image on the local UI.

### Create and send a namecard using user attributes

Namecard messages are custom messages that include the user ID, nickname, avatar, email address, and phone number of the specified user. To create and send a namecard, take the following steps:

1. Create a custom message and set the `event` of the custom message as `userCard`.
2. Add `userId`, `nickname`, and `avatar` as fileds in `ext`. Send the custom message.

Followings are the sample code for creating and sending a namecard message:

```objc
AgoraChatCustomMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatCustomMessageBody alloc] init];
    body.event = @"userCard";
    NSDictionary *messageExt = @{@"userId":AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.currentUsername,
                          @"nickname":@"nickname",
                          @"avatar":@"https://download-sdk.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/downloads/IMDemo/avatar/Image1.png"
                        };
    body.ext = messageExt;
    AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:@"conversationID"
                                                          from:@"sender"
                                                            to:@"receiver"
                                                          body:body
                                                           ext:nil];
    // send message
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message progress:nil completion:^(AgoraChatMessage *message, AgoraChatError *error) {
    }];
```
