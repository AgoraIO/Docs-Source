Stream channels are based on the room model. In <Vg k="SIG" />, communication through stream channels requires use of specific APIs. This page shows you how to join, leave, and send messages in stream channels.

## Understand the tech

To use stream channels, you first create a stream channel object instance. The channel instance gives you access to all stream channel management methods. Use the stream channel instance to:

* Join and leave a channel
* Join and leave topics
* Subscribe to and unsubscribe from topics
* Send messages
* Destroy the channel instance

After joining a stream channel, you listen to event notifications in the channel. To send and receive messages in the channel, you use [topics](../core-functionality/topics). <Vg k="SIG" /> allows thousands of stream channels to exist simultaneously in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. However, due to client-side performance and bandwidth limitations, a single client may only join a limited number of channels concurrently. For details, see [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

* Integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project, and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.

* Activated stream channel capability in <Vg k="SIG" />. For activation, raise a [support ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/). The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> support team confirms activation through a ticket update.

## Implement communication in a stream channel

This section shows you how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement stream channel communication in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
