### Login with a token

To log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> using an RTM token, fetch a token from your token server and pass it to the SDK by calling `login`:


```cpp
// Fetch a token from your token server

// Log in to Signaling
RtmEventHandler rtmHandler;
RtmConfig cfg;
cfg.appId = "your app id";
cfg.userId = "your user id";
cfg.eventHandler = &rtmHandler;
auto rtmClient = createAgoraRtmClient();
if (!rtmClient) {
  exit(-1);
}
auto result = rtmClient->initialize(cfg);
if (!result) {
  exit(-1);
}
rtmClient->login("your token");
```

<Admonition title="Note">
- The user ID and app ID you use to initialize the <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance must be the same as the user ID and app ID you use on the token server to generate a token.
- When integrating the <Vpd k="SDK"/> into your app, ensure that the app certificate is properly configured. The app certificate serves as a key authentication mechanism between your app and Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ to ensure secure and reliable communication.

### Join a stream channel using a token

To join a stream channel using a token, fetch an **RTC** token from your token server and pass it to the SDK when you call `join`. For details, refer to the [API reference](../reference/api#channeljoinpropsag_platform).

### Token expiration and renewal

You configure the validity period of an RTM token in your token generator according to your business needs. The maximum validity period of a token is 24 hours. When an RTM token is about to expire, the `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` callback is triggered 30 seconds before the expiration time. When  you receive this callback, retrieve a fresh RTM token from your token server, and call `renewToken` to pass the new token to the SDK.

If the token expires, the SDK triggers an `onConnectionStateChanged` callback indicating a change in connection status to `RTM_CONNECTION_STATE_FAILED` with the reason `RTM_CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOKEN_EXPIRED`.

In this scenario, log out of <Vpd k="NAME" /> using the `logout` method, retrieve a fresh token, and `login` again.

<Admonition>
An alternative approach to handling token expiration through the `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` and `onConnectionStateChanged` callbacks is to handle expiration proactively. Best practice is to update the token periodically to ensure seamless authentication and uninterrupted operation.
