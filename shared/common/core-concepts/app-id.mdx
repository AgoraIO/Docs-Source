#### App ID

The App ID is a unique key generated by <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s platform to identify each project. Each project in your account is assigned its own unique App ID. The App ID is critical for connecting users within your app. It's used to initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, and as one of the required keys to create authentication tokens for secure communication. Retrieve your <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">App ID</Link> using the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the App ID to identify each app and provide billing and other statistical data services.

App IDs are stored on the front-end client and do not provide access control. Projects using only an App ID allow any user with the App ID to join voice and video streams.

For applications requiring access controls, such as those in production environments, choose an **App ID + Token** mechanism for [user authentication](../get-started/authentication-workflow) when creating a new project. Without an authentication token, your environment is open to anyone with access to your App ID.
