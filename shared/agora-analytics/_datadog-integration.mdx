[Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/) is an observability service for cloud-scale applications, that provides monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. It enables you to visualize and monitor metrics, setup custom alerts, and create dashboards. To analyze <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products data with your other integrations, you can push <Vg k="AA" /> usage, quality, and performance statistics directly to your Datadog account.
