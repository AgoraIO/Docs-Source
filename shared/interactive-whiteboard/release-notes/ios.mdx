#### Compatibility changes

This version deprecates the existing London data center (`gb-lon`) in the Whiteboard Data Center and introduces a new data center in Frankfurt, Europe (`eu`), whose service covers Europe. If you have set `gb-lon` in the previous version, please switch to` eu` after upgrading to this version and enable this data center in Agora Console.

#### New features

**PPT Volume Control**

This version adds the `getSlideVolumeWithCompletionHandler` and `updateSlideVolume `methods to retrieve and update the volume of audio in PPT slides.

**PPT URL Intercept and Replacement**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds a new configuration option, `enableSlideInterrupterAPI`, to enable intercepting and replacing URLs of PPT resources. This feature can be used to encrypt PPT resources uploaded by users and protect their privacy. Once enabled, you can set a callback object by calling `WhiteSDK.setSlideDelegate` and add the logic for replacing PPT URLs in the `slideUrlInterrupter: url: completionHandler` callback. This achieves the functionality of intercepting and replacing PPT URLs.

**PPT Rendering Notification**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds the `whiteSlideAppParams` configuration option for displaying configurations related to [@netless/app-slide](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app/tree/master/packages/app-slide) rendering. Currently, it supports configuring `WhiteSlideAppParams.showRenderError` to show or hide rendering error notifications.

**Custom API Server Domain**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds the `apiHosts` configuration option to configure a list of API server domains for the whiteboard, which can be used for server proxy implementation.

**Custom Module Source**

`RoomParams` adds the `modulesOrigin` configuration option to configure the address for requesting whiteboard module data.

**Document Operation Events**

This release adds the `dispatchDocsEvent` method to send events to the inserted PDF/PPTX documents in the whiteboard, allowing control over document page flipping, page navigation, and slide animation playback.

**Window Fullscreen**

A new property, `WindowParams.fullscreen`, is added to control whether the window is displayed in fullscreen mode.

#### API changes

## v2.16.46

v2.16.46 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Whiteboard tool updates**

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Pencil: Adds support for drawing dotted lines by setting `room.memberState.dottedLine` as `true`.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by setting `room.memberState.textCanSelectText` as `true`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Floatbar**

This release adds the floatbar feature. The floatbar pops up when selecting any whiteboard item, which enables users to
easily edit these whiteboard items. For example, when selecting a stroke, the floatbar enables the user to remove it or change its color.
When selecting some text, the floatbar enables the user to adjust its style or change its typeface.

Modify the `floatBar` parameter in the `WhiteRoomConfig` interface to enable floatbar.

**3. Take screenshots**

This release adds `getLocalSnapShotWithCompletion` in the `WhiteDisplayer` class to take a screenshot of the current whiteboard page.

**4. Request slide log**

This release adds the `requestSlideLogToFilePath` method in the `WhiteSDK` class to write the slide log into a specified file.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- The SDK now automatically tries to recover after the whiteboard crashes due to insufficient web memory. If you have previously
configured `navigationDelegate`, you need to undo that to apply this optimization. In addition, this release adds the
`startRecoveringFromMemoryIssues` and `endRecoveringFromMemoryIssues` callbacks to report when the SDK starts to recover and
finishes its recovery, respectively.
- You can now pause or resume audio mixing or playback in dynamic PPT files with the `pauseAudioMixing` and `resumeAudioMixing` methods.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The creation of the whiteboard app sometimes failed after reconnection.
- When creating the whiteboard app, synchronizing the initial height and width sometimes failed.
- The `WhiteBroadcastState` sometimes failed to initialize when joining the room.
- When using a non-ApplePencil stylus on the iPad, calling `drawOnlyPencil` sometimes caused the whiteboard to crash.
- Calling `drawOnlyPencil` sometimes reported an error when the user did not have write permissions.
- Switching the readable/writable state sometimes caused the configuration to be lost in the `disableCameraTransform` of `mainView`.

#### API changes

**Added**

- New properties in the `MemberState` class: `dottedLine` and `textCanSelectText`
- `pauseAudioMixing`
- `resumeAudioMixing`
- New parameter in the `WhiteRoomConfig` interface: `floatBar`

## v2.16.24

v2.16.24 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Inserting text**

This release adds the `insertText` method to `WhiteRoom` for inserting text at a specified position.

**2. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `disableNewPencilStroke` property to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of `disableNewPencilStroke` is `YES`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you call `disableNewPencil(NO)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `disableNewPencil(NO)`, you can call `disableNewPencilStroke(YES)`.

**3. Getting the scene information**

This release adds the `getSceneFromScenePath` method to the `WhiteDisplayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

**4. Setting whether to only allow drawing and writing using the Apple Pencil**

This release supports setting whether to only allow users to draw and write on the whiteboard using the Apple Pencil on iPad. Before joining a whiteboard room, you can set this by using the `drawOnlyApplePencil` property in `WhiteRoomConfig`; after joining a whiteboard room, you can call the `setDrawOnlyApplePencil` method in `WhiteRoom` to change the setting.

**5. Support for YYKit** 

The Agora Whiteboard SDK for iOS uses [YYModel](https://github.com/ibireme/YYModel) for data type conversion by default. As of this release, the SDK adds support for YYKit. To use [YYKit](https://github.com/ibireme/YYKit), you need to add the following line to the `Podfile` file to add the dependency:

```
pod 'Whiteboard/Whiteboard-YYKit'
```

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Adds tween animation for the new pencil. This allows the SDK to automatically insert frames between keyframes when a user draws or writes with the new pencil, so that remote users see a smoother drawing process. To experience this improvement, ensure that you have called `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- The virtual keyboard did not pop up when clicking `text` on iOS browsers.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.

- Web SDK v2.12.5 or later
