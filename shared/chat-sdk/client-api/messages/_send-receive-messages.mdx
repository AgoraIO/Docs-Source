After logging in to Chat, users can send the following types of messages to a peer user, a chat group, or a chat room:

- Text messages, including hyperlinks and emojis.
- Attachment messages, including image, voice, video, and file messages.
- Location messages.
- CMD messages.
- Custom messages.

The Chat message feature is language agnostic. End users can send messages in any language, as long as their devices support input in that language. 

In addition to sending messages, users can also forward one or more messages. When forwarding multiple messages, users have the following options:

* Forward messages one-by-one 
* Forward combined messages as message history

This page shows how to implement sending, receiving, forwarding multiple messages, and modifying sent messages using the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

    Use <Vpd k="SDK" /> 1.2 or higher if you intend to enable users to forward multiple messages, or to modify sent messages.

- You understand the API call frequency limits as described in [Limitations](/agora-chat/reference/limitations).

## Implementation

This section shows how to implement sending and receiving the various types of messages.
