When interacting with the Agora API, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> may return an error code. Receiving an error code indicates that the SDK has encountered an unrecoverable error that necessitates intervention from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

This page provides descriptions for common error codes along with the associated reasons and their corresponding solutions. For error codes without predefined solutions, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends reaching out to technical support for assistance.

The error codes listed in this section apply to Agora RTC v4.x SDK on the following platforms:

- Native platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows.
- Third-party frameworks (that is, third-party platforms based on native platform encapsulation): Electron, Unity, React Native, Flutter.

During the operation of Agora SDK, error codes may be returned in the following ways:

- In the return value of a failed method call.
- Through the `onError` callback.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">When the SDK returns an error code, it may return a negative number. This negative number corresponds to the positive integer in the error code. For example, a returned value of `-2` corresponds to the error code `2`.</Admonition>

## Common error codes

| Error code | Description |
|:---:|:------------------------------|
| `0` | No error |
| `1` | Generic error (error reasons not clearly classified). Please call the method again. |
| `2` | An invalid parameter was set in the method. For example, the specified channel name contains illegal characters. Please reset the parameter. |
| `3` | The SDK is not ready yet. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>`RtcEngine` initialization failed. Please reinitialize `RtcEngine`.</li><li>The user has not yet joined the channel when the method is called. Please check the calling logic of the method.</li><li>The user has not left the channel when calling the `rate` or `complain` method. Please check the calling logic of the method.</li><li>The audio module is not turned on.</li><li>The assembly is incomplete.</li></ul> |
| `4` | `RtcEngine` This operation is not supported in the current state. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>When using built-in encryption, the encryption mode being set is incorrect.</li><li>Failed to load external encryption library. Please check that the encrypted enumeration value is correct, or reload the external encryption library.</li></ul> |
| `5` | Method call rejected. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>`RtcEngine` initialization failed. Please reinitialize.</li><li>When joining a channel, you set the channel name to a null character `""`. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>In a multi-channel scenario, when calling the `joinChannel` method, the set channel name already exists. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>In a multi-channel scenario, when calling the `joinChannelEx`, the channel name already exists. Please reset the channel name.</li></ul> |
| `6` | The buffer size is not large enough to hold the returned data. |
| `7` | Method is called before `RtcEngine` has been initialized. Please confirm that the `RtcEngine` object has been created and initialized before calling this method. |
| `9` | No operation permission. Please check whether the user has granted the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> permission to use audio and video devices. |
| `10` | Method call timed out. Some method calls require the SDK to return results. If the SDK takes too long to process the event and does not return for more than 10 seconds, this error occurs. |
| `17` | Joining the channel was denied. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>The user is already in the channel. Agora recommends using `CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED` in `onConnectionStateChanged` callbacks to determine whether the user is in the channel. Do not call this method again to join the channel unless the status (1) is received.</li><li>The user started a call test by calling `startEchoTest`, and then tried to join a channel without calling `stopEchoTest`. After starting an echo test, call `stopEchoTest` before joining a channel to end the running test.</li></ul> |
| `18` | Failed to leave channel. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>The user has already left the channel and called `leaveChannel` again to exit the channel. Just stop calling this method.</li><li>The `leaveChannel` method is called before joining a channel. No additional action is required.</li></ul> |
| `19` | The resource is occupied and cannot be reused. |
| `20` | The SDK gave up the request, possibly due to too many requests. |
| `21` | Certain firewall settings under Windows caused `RtcEngine` initialization to fail and then crash. |
| `22` | The SDK fails to allocate resources, possibly because the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> takes up too many resources or the system resources are exhausted. |
| `101` | Not a valid App ID. Please use a valid App ID and rejoin the channel. |
| `102` | Not a valid channel name. Please use a valid channel name and rejoin the channel. |
| `103` | `RtcEngine` is unable to obtain server resources for the current region. Please try specifying a different region when initializing. |
| `109`	| The current token has expired and is no longer valid. Please generate a new token and call `renewToken` to update. This error code is obsolete. The `CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOKEN_EXPIRED` (9) value in the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback is returned instead. |
| `110` | Token is invalid. Generally, the error may be attributed to the following reasons:<ul><li>The app certificate is enabled in the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, but app ID plus token authentication is not used. When the app certificate is enabled for the project, token authentication must be used.</li><li>The `uid` used when generating the token is inconsistent with the `uid` used when joining the channel.</li></ul> This error code is obsolete. The `CONNECTION_CHANGED_INVALID_TOKEN` (8) value in the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback is returned instead. |
| `111` | The network connection is interrupted. After the SDK established a connection with the server, the network connection was lost for more than 4 seconds.
| `112` | Network connection lost. The network connection is interrupted and the SDK cannot connect to the server within 10 seconds. |
| `119` | User failed to switch roles, please try to join the channel again. |
| `120` | Decryption failed. It's possible that the user used the wrong password when joining the channel. Please check the password or guide the user to try to rejoin the channel. |
| `121` | The user ID is invalid. |
| `123` | This user is banned from the server. This error is reported when a user is kicked from the server. |
| `134` | Invalid user account. Possible reasons is that invalid parameters are set. |


## Audio-related error codes

| Error code | Description |
|:---:|:------------------------------|
| `1005` | An audio device error occurred (unspecified error). Please check whether the audio device is occupied by another application, or try to re-enter the channel. |
| `1008` | An error occurred while initializing the playback device. Please check whether the playback device is occupied by another application, or try to re-enter the channel. |
| `1009` | Error starting playback device. Please check whether the playback device is working normally. |
| `1010` | Error stopping playback device. |
| `1011` | An error occurred while initializing the recording device. Please check whether the recording device is working normally, or try to re-enter the channel. |
| `1012` | Error starting recording device. Please check whether the recording device is working normally. |
| `1013` | An error occurred while stopping the recording device. |


## Data flow related error codesâ€‹

| Error code | Description |
|:---:|:------------------------------|
| `113` | The user was not in the channel when the `sendStreamMessage` method was called. |
| `114` | When calling `sendStreamMessage`, the length of data sent is greater than 1024 bytes. |
| `115` | When calling `sendStreamMessage`, the frequency of sending data exceeds the limit (6 KB/s). |
| `116` | When calling `createDataStream`, the number of data streams created is more than limit (5). |
| `117` | Data stream sending timed out. |
