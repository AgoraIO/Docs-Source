3. **Login to <Vg k="MESS" />** 

    1. From the examples menu, choose the **Storage** example.

    1. Use a numeric user ID to log in to <Vg k="MESS" />.

    1. Subscribe to a channel. 

1. **Login to <Vg k="MESS" /> as another user**

    Launch another reference app instance, and log in using a different user ID. Subscribe to the same channel name as before.

1. **Test channel metadata**

    1. In either instance, use `setChannelMetadata` with a key and value to store channel metadata. 
    1. In the other app instance, use `getChannelMetadata` to retrieve the list of metadata key-value pairs for the channel. You see the metadata set by the other user in the list.

1. **Test version control**

    1. Call `setChannelMetadata` to update the value of an existing channel metadata key using a random positive integer for the `Revision` parameter. The storage operation fails due to `outdated revision`.
    
    1. Repeat the previous step but this time use the same value for `Revision` as returned by `getChannelMetadata` for the key you are updating. This time, the operation succeeds.

1. **Test locks**

    1. Call `setLock` with a lock name to create a lock.

    1. Use the name of the lock you just created in `setChannelMetadata`. You see an error reporting that the lock has not been acquired.

    1. Call `acquireLock` with the name of the lock you created to acquire the lock. 
    
    1. Retry calling `setChannelMetadata` using the acquired lock. This time the channel key value is successfully updated.

    1. Call `getLocks` to retrieve a list of all current locks.

    1. Call `releaseLock` to release the lock, and `removeLock` to delete it.

1. **Test user metadata**

    1. Subscribe to metadata updates of another user by calling `subscribeUserMetadata` with the user ID of the remote user.

    1. In the other instance, call `setUserMetadata` to set a value in the user's metadata. You are notified of the update in the other app instance.
