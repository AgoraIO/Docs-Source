The presence feature enables users to publicly display their online presence status and quickly determine the status of other users. Users can also customize their presence status, which adds fun and diversity to real-time chatting.

The following illustration shows the implementation of creating a custom presence status and how various presence statues look in a contact list:

- Subscribe to the presence status of one or more users
- Unsubscribe from the presence status of one or more users
- Listen for presence status updates
- Publish a custom presence status
- Retrieve the list of subscriptions
- Retrieve the presence status of one or more users

The following figure shows the workflow of how clients subscribe to and publish presence statuses:

</PlatformWrapper>

As shown in the figure, the workflow of presence subscription and publication is as follows:

1. User A subscribes to the presence status of User B.
2. User B publishes a presence status.
3. The Agora Chat server triggers an event to notify User A about the presence update of User B.
