Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In the Unity Editor, mount the event handling functions defined in the code to the corresponding Button components.

1. In your code, replace the value for `appId` with your app ID from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and save the project.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="info">
    To quickly verify the basic functionality during the testing phase, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the Agora project, and then use the `your_appid` and `your_token` values with your project's app ID.
    </Admonition>

1. In Unity, click **Play**. You see the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> running on your device.

1. Run another instance of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with the same `appId` but a different `userId`.

1. In either <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance, type a message in the input box under **Send string message to message channel** and and press **Send Message**.

    You see the message displayed in the other <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
