Set up your project according to your target platform.

### iOS 

Since Apple does not support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream. You use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the main process.

Take the following steps to set up your <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> project:

1. Go to your project folder and open the `ios/.xcodeproj` file with Xcode.
1. Navigate to **File > New > Target...**, select **Broadcast Upload Extension** in the pop-up window, and then click **Next**:

1. Fill in the **Product Name** and other information in the popup window, uncheck **Include UI Extension**, and click **Finish**. Xcode automatically creates a folder for the extension that contains the `SampleHandler.m` file.
1. Under **Target**, select the newly created extension. Click **General** and set the iOS version to 12.0 or later under **Deployment Info**.
The memory usage of **Broadcast Upload Extension** is limited to 50 MB. Make sure that the memory usage of **Screen Sharing Extension** does not exceed 50 MB.

1. Modify project settings to implement the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> code logic, and choose one of the following two methods according to your business needs:

    - If you only need to use the functionality in the `AgoraReplayKitExtension.xcframework` dynamic library provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, select **Target** as the extension you just created, and change the **Value** in **Info** corresponding to **NSExtension > NSExtensionPrincipalClass** from **SampleHandler** to **AgoraReplayKitHandler**:

    - If you need to implement some additional business logic, refer to the following code to modify the `SampleHandler.m` file:

        ``` objective-c
        #import "SampleHandler.h"

        @implementation SampleHandler

        - (void)broadcastStartedWithSetupInfo:(NSDictionary<NSString *,NSObject *> *)setupInfo {
            // User requests to start broadcasting
        }

        - (void)broadcastPaused {
            // User requests a pause in broadcasting, screen sharing pauses
        }

        - (void)broadcastResumed {
            // User requests to resume broadcasting, screen sharing resumes
        }

        - (void)broadcastFinished {
            // User requests to stop broadcasting
        }

        - (void)processSampleBuffer:(CMSampleBufferRef)sampleBuffer withType:(RPSampleBufferType)sampleBufferType {

            switch (sampleBufferType) {
                case RPSampleBufferTypeVideo:
                    break;
                case RPSampleBufferTypeAudioApp:
                    break;
                case RPSampleBufferTypeAudioMic:
                    break;

                default:
                    break;
            }
        }

        @end
        ```

### macOS and Windows

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> currently supports the following two <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> options on the macOS, and Windows platforms:

    - Share a specific screen or a portion of a specified screen using `displayId`.
    - Share a specific window or a portion of a specified window using `windowId`.

The API calling sequence is shown in the figure below:
