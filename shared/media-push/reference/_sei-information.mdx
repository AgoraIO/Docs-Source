By default, Agora adds the encoding information of the current video to the transcoded H264/H265 SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information) during Media Push. The encoding information is a JSON string. The following is the sample code:

```json
{
    "canvas": {        
        "w": 640,
        "h": 360,
        "bgnd": "#000000"
    },
    "regions": [
        {
        "uid": 1,
        "alpha": 1.0,
        "zorder": 1,
        "volume": 50, 
        "x": 0, 
        "y": 0,   
        "w": 320,
        "h": 360
        },
         {
        "uid": 2,
        "alpha": 1.0,
        "zOrder": 1,
        "volume": 89,
        "x": 320,
        "y": 0,   
        "w": 320,
        "h": 360
        }
    ],
    "ver": "20190611",
    "ts": 1535385600000,
    "app_data": ""
}
```

### The structure of SEI

The SEI information is as follows:

```
0000  0664bd7b 22617070 5f646174 61223a22  .d.{"app_data":"
0010  222c2263 616e7661 73223a7b 2262676e  ","canvas":{"bgn

```

In which:

- `06`: The SEI frame.
- `64`: The SEI frame type defined by the user. Here we define it as 100.
- `bd`: The length of the SEI frame. The following are some sample calculations rendered in decimal and hexadecimal:
	- If the length is 922, because 922 can be divided by 255 (`0xff`) three times and the remainder is 157 (`0x9d`), then `bd` is `ffffff9d`. 
	- If the length is 572, because 572 can be divided by 255 (`0xff`) two times and the remainder is 62 (`0x3e`), then `bd` is `ffff3e`. 
	- If the length is 234, because 234 divided by 255 (`0xff`) gives 0 and the remainder is 234 (`0xea`), then `bd` is `ea`.
- Other digits: Content of the SEI frame.

### FAQ

Q: If I use the SEI frame in Media Push, is it necessary to use the signaling system to send the layout information? Do I use either signaling or SEI?
A: Adding the H264/H265 SEI information to the video stream during Media Push is different from sending the uplink data. Only the `app_data` parameter of the SEI information relates to the uplink data. 

Q: Does the signaling system send the layout information? Why does the SEI frame contain the layout information?
A: Agora puts the layout information in the SEI frame because the audience members in the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile also need the layout information of the current stream to set the window region of the hosts.
