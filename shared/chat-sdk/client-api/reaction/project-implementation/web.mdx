### Add a reaction

Call `addReaction` to add a reaction to the specified message. You can use `onReactionChange` to listen for the state of adding the reaction.

```javascript
// Add a reaction
conn.addReaction({ messageId: "messageId", reaction: "reaction" });
// Listen for the state of the reaction.
conn.addEventHandler("REACTION", {
  onReactionChange: (reactionMsg) => {
    console.log(reactionMsg);
  },
});
```

### Remove a reaction

Call `deleteReaction` to remove the specified reaction. You can also listen for the reaction change in `onReactionChange`.

```javascript
// Remove the reaction.
conn.deleteReaction({ messageId: "messageId", reaction: "reaction" });
// Listen for reaction state change.
conn.addEventHandler("REACTION", {
  onReactionChange: (reactionMsg) => {
    console.log(reactionMsg);
  },
});
```

### Retrieve a list of reactions

Call `getReactionList` to retrieve a list of reactions from the server. This method also returns the basic information of the reactions, including the content of the reaction, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and a list of the first three user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```javascript
conn
  .getReactionList({ chatType: "singleChat", messageId: "messageId" })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

### Retrieve the details of the reaction

Call `getReactionDetail` to get the detailed information of the reaction from the server. The detailed information includes the reaction content, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and the complete list of user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```javascript
conn
  .getReactionDetail({
    messageId: "messageId",
    reaction: "reaction",
    cursor: null,
    pageSize: 20,
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

### Retrieve the reaction in the roaming message

When calling `fetchHistoryMessages` to retrieve historical messages from the server, if the message has a reaction attached to it, the retrieved message body also contains the information of the reaction.

```javascript
conn.fetchHistoryMessages({ queue: "user", count: 20 }).then((messages) => {
  console.log(messages);
});
```
