description: >
  Retrieve tokens generated by an authentication token server to securely connect to Agora channels.
---

<Vg k="WHITE" /> uses a set of tokens for user authentication: SDK Tokens, Room Tokens, and Task Tokens. Each type of token can be assigned to an admin, writer, or reader role. For details, see [Token Overview](../develop/authentication-workflow).

Agora provides an open source [netless-token](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-token/blob/master/README-en.md) repository on GitHub that includes code samples for generating tokens using <a href="#javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="#typescript">TypeScript</a>, <a href="#java">Java</a>, <a href="#golang">Golang</a>,  <a href="#php">PHP</a>,  <a href="#ruby">Ruby</a>, and  <a href="#csharp">C#</a>.

This article introduces how to generate tokens from your app server using these code samples and [your access keys (the AK and SK)](../get-started/enable-whiteboard#get-security-credentials-for-your-whiteboard-project).

<div class="alert note">To enhance security, do not save or send the AK and SK to your app clients. You should save the AK and SK on the app server, and issue tokens from the app server according to the actual needs of your app use-cases.</div>

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have enabled <Vg k="WHITE" /> for your <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> project.

In the `netless-token-master/csharp` folder, you can find:

- A `Token.cs` file, which contains the source code for generating tokens.
- A `README.md` file, which contains code samples for generating tokens.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed the latest version of Visual Studio.

### Generate an SDK Token

Refer to the following steps to generate an SDK Token:

1. Download the [netless-token](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-token) repository, or clone it to a local directory.

2. Go to the `netless-token-master/csharp` folder and open the `csharp.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. Fill in your AK, SK, token validity period, and token role in the `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
using System;
using Netless;
class Program
{
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     string token = NetlessToken.SdkToken(
         // Fill in the AK you get from Agora Console
         "ak",
         // Fill in the SK you get from Agora Console
         "sk",
         // Set the Token validity period. If you set it to 0, the token will never expire 
         1000 * 60 * 10,
         // Define the permissions granted by the token. You can set it to TokenRole.Admin, TokenRole.Writer, or TokenRole.Reader 
         new SdkContent(TokenRole.Admin)); 
     Console.WriteLine(token);
 }
}
```

4. Run the project in Visual Studio. You should see a token prefixed with `NETLESSSDK_` in the terminal.

### Generate a Room Token

Refer to the following steps to generate a Room Token:

1. Download the [netless-token](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-token) repository or clone it to a local directory.

2. Go to the `netless-token-master/csharp` folder and open the `csharp.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. Delete the code in the `Program.cs` file and copy the following sample code into it:

```csharp
using System;
using Netless;
class Program
{
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     string token = NetlessToken.RoomToken(
         // Fill in the AK you get from Agora Console 
         "ak",
         // Fill in the SK you get from Agora Console 
         "sk",
         // Set the Token validity period. If you set it to 0, the token will never expire
         1000 * 60 * 10,
         // Define the permissions granted by the token. You can set it to TokenRole.Admin, TokenRole.Writer, or TokenRole.Reader 
         // Fill in the Room UUID. You can get it by calling the RESTful API to create a room or get a room list 
         new RoomContent(TokenRole.Admin, "房间的 UUID")
         ); 
     Console.WriteLine(token);
 }
}
```

4. Run the project in Visual Studio. You should see a token prefixed with `NETLESSROOM_` in the terminal.

### Generate a Task Token

Refer to the following steps to generate a Task Token:

1. Download the [netless-token](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-token) repository or clone it to a local directory.

2. Go to the `netless-token-master/csharp` folder and open the `csharp.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. Delete the code in the `Program.cs` file and copy the following sample code into it:

```csharp
using System;
using Netless;
class Program
{
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     string token = NetlessToken.RoomToken(
         // Fill in the AK you get from Agora Console 
         "ak",
         // Fill in the SK you get from Agora Console 
         "sk",
         // Set the Token validity period. If you set it to 0, the token will never expire
         1000 * 60 * 10,
         // Define the permissions granted by the token. You can set it to TokenRole.Admin, TokenRole.Writer, or TokenRole.Reader 
         // Fill in the Task UUID. You can get it by calling the RESTful API to start a file-conversion task 
         new TaskContent(TokenRole.Admin, "Your Task UUID")
         ); 
     Console.WriteLine(token);
 }
}
```

4. Run the project in Visual Studio. You should see a token prefixed with `NETLESSTASK_` in the terminal.
