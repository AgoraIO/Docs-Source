In some scenarios, raw audio and video captured through the camera and microphone must be processed to achieve the desired functionality or to enhance the user experience. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to pre-process and post-process the captured audio and video data for implementation of custom playback effects.

## Understand the tech

You can use the raw data processing functionality in <Vg k="VSDK" /> to process the feed according to your particular scenario. This feature enables you to pre-process the captured signal before sending it to the encoder, or to post-process the decoded signal before playback. To implement processing of raw video and audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps.

- Set up video and audio frame observers.
- Register video and audio frame observers before joining a channel.
- Set the format of audio frames captured by each callback.
- Implement callbacks in the frame observers to process raw video and audio data. 
- Unregister the frame observers before you leave a channel.

The figure below shows the workflow you need to implement to process raw video and audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to integrate custom audio and video in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement raw data processing

When a user captures video and audio data, the data is available to the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> for processing before it is played. This section shows how to retrieve this data and process it, step-by-step.
