### Equipment quality test

The SDK provides the `startEchoTest` method to test the network connection and whether the audio and video devices are working properly. Refer to the following steps to implement the device quality test:

1. Before joining a channel, call `startEchoTest`. Specify the `intervalInSeconds` parameter to set the delay time for the echo test. The value range is 2-10 seconds and the default value is 10.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The user's audio is played back after a short delay. If the playback is normal, it means that the user's devices and upstream and downstream network are working normally. 

1. To stop the test, call `stopEchoTest`, and then call `joinChannelByToken` to join a channel.

To implement running an echo test in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` typescript
this.engine.startEchoTest(10);
this.engine.stopEchoTest();
```

### Network quality analysis

The SDK provides the `startLastmileProbeTest` method to probe the last-mile network quality before joining a channel. The method returns information about the network quality score and network statistics. Take the following steps to run a last-mile network quality probe test:

1. Before joining a channel or switching user roles, call `startLastmileProbeTest` to start the network test. Set the probe configuration and the expected maximum bitrate in `LastmileProbeConfig`.

1. After you start the test, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
    
    - `onLastmileQuality`: This callback is triggered two seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It provides feedback on the upstream and downstream network quality through a subjective `quality` score.

    - `onLastmileProbeResult`: This callback is triggered 30 seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It returns objective real-time network statistics, including `packetLossRate`, network `jitter`, and `availableBandwidth`.

1. Call `stopLastmileProbeTest` to stop last-mile network testing.

To implement network quality testing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` typescript
this.engine.registerEventHandler({
  onLastmileQuality(quality: QualityType) {},
  onLastmileProbeResult(result: LastmileProbeResult) {},
});
this.engine.startLastmileProbeTest({
  probeUplink: true,
  probeDownlink: true,
  expectedUplinkBitrate: 100000,
  expectedDownlinkBitrate: 100000,
});
this.engine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
```
