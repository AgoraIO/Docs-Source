4. Compile the sample project by executing the following commands in a terminal window:
    
    ```bash
    cd <project-root>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example
    
    ./build-x86_64.sh
    ```

1. Run the sample <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by executing the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd out/x86_64

    ./hello_rtsa --app-id <your-app-id> --channel-id <your-channel-name> --token <authentication-token>
    ```
    
    Make sure you insert your app ID, channel ID, and token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> in to the command.

    On launch, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel and shows output similar to the following:

    ```bash
    [INF] Welcome to RTSA SDK v1.9.0
    [INF] File parser found: h264
    [INF] File parser found: pcm
    [INF] [conn-1] Join the channel demo successfully, uid 2645490531 elapsed 602 ms
    [INF] [conn-1] Bandwidth change detected. Please adjust encoder bitrate to 499 kbps
    ```

1. **Test with an unauthorized user** 
    
    In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**. You see the local user video in your browser.
    
    In the terminal, your compiled <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> shows a decryption error as the web demo does not have the SSL key and salt for stream encryption and decryption.

    ```bash
    [INF] [conn-1] Remote user "3674330576" has joined the channel, elapsed 6784 ms
    [WRN] Error 120 is captured. Error msg "audio:decrypt error"
    [WRN] Error 120 is captured. Error msg "video:not set"
    ```

1. **Test with an authorized user** 

    Open two Linux terminals. Navigate to `<project-root>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example/out/x86_64` and execute the following command to launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> from both terminals.

    ```bash
    ./hello_rtsa --app-id <your-app-id> --channel-id <your-channel-name> --token <authentication-token>
    ```
    
    You see that both clients join the same channel and successfully exchange data as they are using the same SSL key and salt.
