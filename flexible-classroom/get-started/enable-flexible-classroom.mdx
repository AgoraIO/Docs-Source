## Configure the whiteboard feature

If you want to upload PPT, Word, or PDF files to a <Vg k="FC"/> and display these files on the whiteboard, you need to configure the whiteboard feature in <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>. Before configuring the whiteboard feature, ensure that you have enabled a third-party cloud storage service. Currently, Agora only supports [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls).

To configure the whiteboard feature, take the following steps:

1. On the <Vg k="FC"/> configuration page in <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>, find the whiteboard module:

   ![configure-whiteboard-feature](/images/flexible-classroom/configure-whiteboard-feature.png)

1. To use PPT, Word, PDF and other courseware, you need to enable advanced services. Go to Configuration under Advanced Services to enable and configure the document-to-webpage, document-to-picture, and screenshot services for Smart Classroom. For details, see [Enable whiteboard server-side features](../../interactive-whiteboard/develop/enable-whiteboard#enable-whiteboard-server-side-features).


1. Configure a third-party cloud storage service for storing files uploaded in a classroom. Fill in the following information:

   * `region`: The location of the data center you specified when creating a bucket in Amazon S3.
   * `endpoint`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.
   * `Bucket`: The bucket name in Amazon S3.
   * `folder`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as whiteboard.
   * `accessKey`: The Access Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to identify visitors.
   * `secretKey`: The Secret Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to authenticate signatures.

   For further information on how to obtain these parameters, see the [Amazon S3 document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html).

## Configure classroom storage and recording

To setup and configure storage and recording in for your classrooms:

1.  **Setup third-party cloud storage**

1. **Configure your classroom**

     1. Find the cloud recording module on the **<Vg k="FC"/> configuration** page in <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>:

        ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641368314262)

    1. Configure storage

        Pass in the `storageConfig` JSON object for storing recorded files. Use the following fields to specify the url and storage location of the recording file.
        
        * `endpoint`: (required) String. The full path composed of the Bucket name and the access domain name. For example, if your Bucket name is "agora-recording", and the OSS access domain name is "oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com", then the `endpoint` field is set to `https:// agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com`

         * `fileNamePrefix`: (Optional) JSONArray. An array of strings that sets the path of the recorded files in the third-party cloud storage. For example, if `fileNamePrefix = ["directory1","directory2"]`, Agora Cloud Recording will add the prefix `directory1/directory2/` before the name of the recorded file. You can also use variables to specify a dynamic path. 

         Sample `storageConfig`:

         ```json
         {
               "vendor": 2,
               "region": 3,
               "bucket": "xxxxx",
               "accessKey": "xxxxxxf",
               "secretKey": "xxxxx",
               "endpoint": "https://agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com",
               "fileNamePrefix": [
                  "scenario",
                  "recording"
               ]
         }
         ```

         To set the path dynamically, you can use these two types of variables:

         <table>
         <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Variable</th>
            <th>Description</th>
         </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Fixed Variables</td>
               <td><code>`${appId}`</code></td>
            <td>App ID</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><code>`${roomUuid}`</code></td>
            <td>The Uuid of the class to be recorded</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td rowspan="4">Date variables</td>
            <td><code>`${yyyy}`</code></td>
            <td>Year</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><code>`${MM}`</code></td>
            <td>Month</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><code>`${dd}`</code></td>
            <td>Day</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><code>`${yyyyMMdd}`</code>、<code>`${yyyyMM}`</code>、<code>`${yyyy-dd}`</code>、<code>`${MM_dd}`</code></td>
            <td>Date variables can be combined into different formats</td>
         </tr>
         </tbody>
         </table>

         For example, you set `fileNamePrefix` field as follows:

         ```json
            "fileNamePrefix": [
            "scenario", 
            "recording",
            "${appId}",
            "${yyyyMM}",
            "${roomUuid}"
            ]
         ```
         The recording storage path will be similar to `/scenario/recording/<appID>/202303/<roomUUiD>/filename.mp4`.

         For complete parameter descriptions, see [storageConfig](../../cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#cloud-storage-configuration).

    1. Configure recording.

       By default, you record teacher audio and video in [composite recording mode](../../cloud-recording/develop/composite-mode). Your recorded files are stored in Agora's Amazon S3 account. To change the default behavior, Pass in the `recordingConfig` JSON object:

        ```json
        {
            "maxIdleTime": 30,
            "streamTypes": 2,
            "channelType": 0
        }
        ```

       For parameter descriptions, see [recordingConfig](/cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#recording-configuration).

## Configure Chat

To enable and configure Chat:

1. In <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>, navigate to [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects).

1. Click **Config** next to the project for which you want to enable Chat.

1. In the **Features** section of the **Edit Project** page, click **Enable/Configure** next to **Chat**.

1. Select the data center location.

   ![](/images/flexible-classroom/select-data-center.png)

    Agora generates the Chat-related `AppKey`, `OrgName`, `AppName`, and API access information.

1. In the **Features** section of the **Edit Project** page, click **Config** next to **<Vg k="FC"/>**.

1. In the **Chat** section, complete the required fields:

   ![](/images/flexible-classroom/synchronize-chat.png)

   - **API host**: The REST API access address generated when enabling Chat.
   - **orgName**: The unique identifier of the enterprise generated when enabling Chat.
   - **superAdmin**: The super administrator username prefix. Only numbers and letters are supported. Agora uses `${superAdmin}-${timestamp}` as the super administrator to create a chat room.
   - **appName**: The unique name of the app generated when enabling Chat.
   - **appKey**: The unique identifier of the app generated when enabling Chat.

## Considerations
To ensure that Agora can access files in your third-party cloud storage space, you should enable public access or higher permissions for third-party storage spaces.

#### AWS S3 account configuration

Configure your AWS S3 account as follows:

* Bucket policy

   ```json
   {
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Id":"Policy1622700880591",
      "Statement":[
         {
            "Sid":"Stmt1622700872941",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":"*",
            "Action":"s3:GetObject",
            "Resource":"arn:aws-cn:s3:::agora-adc-artifacts/*"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

* Cross-origin resource sharing

   ```json
   [
      {
         "AllowedHeaders":[
            "*"
         ],
         "AllowedMethods":[
            "PUT",
            "GET"
         ],
         "AllowedOrigins":[
            "*"
         ],
         "ExposeHeaders":[
            
         ]
      }
   ]
   ```
