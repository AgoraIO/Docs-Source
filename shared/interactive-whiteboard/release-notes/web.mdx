## v2.16.49

This version was released on xx, 2024.

#### New features

**Fill closed shape elements**

`MemberState` adds the `fillColor` property, which is used to set the fill color of closed shape elements such as circles and rectangles.

**Automatic switch to select tool**

`MemberState` adds the following properties to automatically switch to the select tool after using the corresponding whiteboard tool:

- `textCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after typing with the text tool.
- `rectangleCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after drawing a rectangle.
- `ellipseCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after drawing a circle.
- `straightCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after drawing a straight line.
- `arrowCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after drawing an arrow.
- `shapeCompleteToSelector`: Automatically switch to the select tool after drawing a triangle, bubble, or other shapes.

**Whiteboard drawing performance optimization strategy**

The `joinRoom` method adds the `optimizeOptions` parameter to set the performance optimization strategy for whiteboard drawing. The performance optimization options include:

- Adjusting the refresh interval of whiteboard drawing: A lower refresh interval provides smoother stroke display but has a higher resource consumption, while a higher refresh interval may result in laggy strokes but has a lower resource consumption.
- Using single canvas drawing: By default, the whiteboard uses two canvases alternately to avoid flickering on some devices during drawing. Using a single canvas drawing can eliminate redraws and reduce performance consumption.
- Using floating canvas: When writing on the whiteboard, after enabling single canvas drawing, a floating canvas of approximately 256 x 256px is generated based on the drawing position. When subsequent drawings are within the range of this floating canvas, the synchronization of strokes is limited to this floating canvas, reducing performance consumption.

#### Improvements

This version includes the following optimizations:

- `MemberState` adds the `textSizeOverride` property, which is used to set the default font size of the text tool. If not set, the default font size used will be the same as the last created text element.
- The `room.useNativeClipboard` property is added to set whether to use the native clipboard. When enabled, the whiteboard shortcuts for copy and paste in `HotKeys` will be disabled and replaced with the native `copy` and `paste` events.
- `DisplayerCallbacks` adds the `onBackgroundError` callback to report background image loading failure.
- `RoomCallbacks` adds the `onObjectsLimit` callback to report when the number of elements in the whiteboard exceeds the limit. When the limit is reached, the frontend will throw warnings and events.
- `ImageInformation` adds the `crossOrigin` property to set whether to load images in a cross-origin manner. It is enabled by default.
- The `room` class adds the `syncMode` property. When set to `true`, synchronization will be more frequent but may slightly affect animation smoothness.
- A floating toolbar is displayed when selecting graphic elements, such as rectangles and circles, drawn on the whiteboard.
- The `clearUndoHistory` method is added to clear the undo history.
- Setting `cursorAdapter: false` can hide the built-in cursors, such as the laser pen, eraser, and so on.
- Text elements now have a fixed line height to avoid display differences across platforms.

#### Fixed issues

This version fixes the following issues:

- Memory leaks caused by not destroying certain listeners when exiting the room.
- Exception errors when read-only users pressed the Esc key.
- Occasional display errors when drawing dashed lines.
- An issue where erasing text with the eraser tool on touch devices did not work properly.
- Occasional white screen when entering the room without any error messages.
- Copied and pasted text elements could not be selected.
- The persistent highlight of the text box content after deselecting the text box.

#### Compatibility changes

This version deprecates the existing London data center (`gb-lon`) in the Whiteboard Data Center and introduces a new data center in Frankfurt, Europe (`eu`), whose service covers Europe. If you have set `gb-lon` in the previous version, please switch to` eu` after upgrading to this version and enable this data center in Agora Console.

#### Fixed issues

This version fixed the issue on the Windows platform when using the Whiteboard Web App where the `shift` key was incorrectly detected, causing the pencil tool to switch to drawing straight lines and unable to revert back.

## v2.16.37

v2.16.37 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Whiteboard tool updates**

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Ellipse: Press the `Alt` or `option` button to draw a circle with the cursor as the center.
- Pencil:
  - Draw straight lines: The user can press `shift` to draw a straight line.
  - Draw dotted lines: Add `dottedLine: true` in `room.memberState` to enable this feature.
  - Writing performance: Adds support for adjusting the balance between the performance and the quality of the pencil
  tool by modifying the `NewPencilWritingQuality` enum.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by adding `textCanSelectText: true` in `room.memberState`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Screenshot to canvas**

This release adds the `screenshotToCanvas` method to take a screenshot and write it to canvas.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The recall and redo function sometimes got reset after the user switched pages or reconnected.

- The `floatBar` did not work properly on some touch devices.

#### API changes

**Added**

- New properties in the `MemberState` class: `dottedLine` and `textCanSelectText`
- `NewPencilWritingQuality`
- `screenshotToCanvas`
- New value in the `ApplianceNames` enum: `pencilEraser`

## v2.16.24

v2.16.24 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Text editing**

To support custom text editing options, this release adds the following APIs.

- `insertText`: Inserts text at a specified position.
- `updateText`: Modifies the specified text.
- `updateSelectedText`: Modifies the font style of the currently selected text, including font size, color, bold style, and italic style.

You can use these APIs to customize the text input box and editing toolbar.

This release also adds the `textColor`, `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, and `lineThrough` properties to `MemberState` to provide richer text editing options. When you use the `text` tool provided by the Whiteboard SDK but want to customize the text editing toolbar, you can set the `floatBar` property in `JoinRoomParams` as `false` and edit the text using the new properties in `MemberState`.

<div class="alert note">This release deletes the <code>updateTextFontSize</code> method. Instead, you can use <code>updateSelectedText</code> or <code>textSize</code> in <code>MemberState</code>.</div>

**2. Image rotation**

This release adds the `disableRotation` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable image rotation. The SDK enables image rotation by default, which allows users to rotate the selected image by any angle. If you want to disable the rotation, you can set `disableRotation(true)`.

**3. Tween animation**

This release adds the tween animation feature for the `pencil` tool. When a user draws or writes with the pencil, the SDK automatically inserts frames between keyframes so that to remote users see a smoother drawing process, but this feature increases latency.

This release also adds the `disableCurveAnimes` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` for enabling or disabling the the tween animation feature. The tween animation feature is enabled in the SDK by default. To disable it, you can set `disableCurveAnimes(true)`.

<div class="alert note">Tween animations take effect only when <code>disableNewPencil</code> is set as <code>false</code>.</div>

**4. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `disableNewPencilStroke` property to `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of `disableNewPencilStroke` is `true`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you set `disableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `disableNewPencil(false)`, you can call `disableNewPencilStroke(true)`.

<div class="alert note">The stroke effect takes effect only when <code>disableNewPencil</code> is set as <code>false</code>.</div>

**5. Getting the scene information**

This release adds the `getScene` method to the `Displayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

**6. Scene callbacks**

This release adds the `createScenesCallback` method for creating a listener object for a scene directory. After the listener object is successfully created, when the scenes and subdirectories in the specified scene directory change, the SDK triggers the callbacks you have registered in `ScenesCallbacks` to report the scene events.

**7. Reporting exceptions that occur when playing the media file in a dynamic PPT slide**

This release adds the `onPPTMediaPlayError` callback to report exceptions that occur during the playing of the media file in a dynamic PPT slide.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Optimizes the writing performance on Android browsers.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- Rendering exceptions and errors occurred when using the SDK on an early version of React.
- The virtual keyboard did not pop up when clicking `text` on iOS browsers.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.

## v2.15.0

v2.15.0 was released on November 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

To help you manage users in a room, this release adds the `uid` property in `JoinRoomParams`, for setting the unique identifier of a user.

If you upgrade the SDK to v2.15.0 or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you pass in a string `uid` in `JoinRoomParams` when calling `joinRoom`. The `uid` of each user cannot be longer than 1024 bytes and must be unique in the same room. For more information, see [Join a Whiteboard Room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-sdk#join-the-whiteboard-room-from-your-app-client).

#### New features
