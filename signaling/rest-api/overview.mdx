The <Vpd k="SIG" /> REST APIs provide server-side messaging capabilities that complement the Signaling SDK. Send messages to users and channels, retrieve conversation history, and track user events from your backend without requiring recipients to be actively connected.

## API basics

All requests are sent to the host `api.agora.io`. See [Ensure service reliability](#ensure-service-reliability) for alternate domain names.

- **Authentication**: All APIs require [Basic Auth](restful-authentication) for authentication.
- **Request**: Refer to the respective API examples.
- **Response**: The response content is in JSON format.
- **Base URL**: `https://api.agora.io/dev/v2/project/<appid>`  
    where `<appid>` is the Agora [app ID](/signaling/reference/glossary#app-id) for your project. 

<Admonition type="info">
- All the request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.
- For each app ID, the maximum combined frequency of the peer-to-peer message and channel message APIs is 500 calls per second.
</Admonition>

## REST APIs

- **Messaging APIs**

    The messaging time delay from the server to the client must be less than 200 ms, Agora recommends that you use the Signaling SDK for Linux to send messages from the server to the client.

    - [Peer-to-peer message](peer-to-peer-message): Sends a peer-to-peer message from the server. The user who sends the message does not have to log in to Signaling.

    - [Channel message](channel-message): Sends a channel message from the server. You can send a message to a channel without joining it first.

    - [Get message history](message-history): Retrieves historical messages from the specified channel. Returns messages based on timestamp range and message count parameters.

- **Event APIs**

    - [User events](user-events): Gets user login and logout events from the Signaling server. Events are removed from the server once retrieved.

    - [Channel events](channel-events): Gets channel join and leave events from the Signaling server. Events are removed from the server once retrieved.
