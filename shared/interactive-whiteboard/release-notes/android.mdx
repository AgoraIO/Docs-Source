## v2.16.42

v2.16.42 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Whiteboard tool updates**

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Pencil: Adds support for drawing dotted lines by adding `dottedLine: true` in `room.memberState`.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by adding `textCanSelectText: true` in `room.memberState`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Floatbar**

This release adds the floatbar feature. The floatbar pops up when selecting any whiteboard item, which enables users to
easily edit these whiteboard items. For example, when selecting a stroke, the floatbar enables the user to remove it or
change its color. When selecting text, the floatbar enables the user to adjust its style or change its typeface.

Call the `setUsingFloatBar` method to enable the floatbar.

**3. Remove whiteboard pages**

This release adds the `removePage` method to delete a specified whiteboard page.

**4. Request slide log**

This release adds the `requestSlideLog` method in the `WhiteSdk` class to request the slide log on the client.
This facilitates debugging slide-related issues.

**5. Player callbacks**

To facilitate listening to the state changes of `Player`, this release adds `addPlayerListener` and `removePlayerListener`
methods to add and remove player callbacks.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the audio playback control in PPT files. You can now pause or resume audio mixing or playback in
dynamic PPT files with the `pauseAudioMixing` and `resumeAudioMixing` methods.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- Under multi-window mode, no callback was received when the `sceneState` changed.
- The creation of the whiteboard app sometimes failed after reconnection.
- When creating the whiteboard app, synchronizing the initial height and width sometimes failed.
- Switching the readable/writable state sometimes caused the configuration to be lost in the `disableCameraTransform` of `mainView`.

#### API changes

**Added**

- New properties in the `MemberState` class: `dottedLine` and `textCanSelectText`
- New property in the `Appliance` class: `PENCIL_ERASER`
- `removePage`
- `pauseAudioMixing`
- `resumeAudioMixing`
- `addPlayerListener`
- `removePlayerListener`
- `setUsingFloatBar`

## v2.16.21

v2.16.21 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**SDK integration changes**

As of v2.16.0, Agora only updates the `netless-io:whiteboard-android` GitHub repository; Agora no longer maintains the `duty-os:white-sdk-android` GitHub repository. When integrating the SDK v2.16.0 or later with JitPack, you need to modify the `implementation` field under `dependencies` in the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file as follows:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.netless-io:whiteboard-android:<version>'
}
```

For details, see [Get the SDK](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-sdk#get-the-whiteboard-sdk).

#### New features

**1. Inserting text**

This release adds the `insertText` method for inserting text at a specified position.

**2. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `setDisableNewPencilStroke` method to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of the `disableNewPencilStroke` parameter in this method is `true`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you call `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `setDisableNewPencil(false)`, you can call `setDisableNewPencilStroke(true)`.

This release also adds the `isDisableNewPencilStroke` method to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to get whether the stroke effect of the new pencil is disabled.

**3. Getting the scene information**

adds the `getScene` method to the `Displayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Adds tween animation for the new pencil. This allows the SDK to automatically insert frames between keyframes when a user draws or writes with the new pencil, so that remote users see a smoother drawing process. To experience this improvement, ensure that you have called `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil.
- Optimizes the writing performance on Android browsers.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.
