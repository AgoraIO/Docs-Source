In certain scenarios, it may be necessary to process raw audio and video captured through the camera and microphone to achieve desired functionality or enhance the user experience. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides the capability to pre-process and post-process the captured audio and video data, allowing for the implementation of custom playback effects.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, windows">

## Understand the tech

<Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to pre-process the captured video frames before sending the data to the encoder or perform post-processing on the received video frames after sending the data to the decoder.

The following figure shows the video data processing flow in the SDK video module.

* Position (2) corresponds to the `onCaptureVideoFrame` callback.
* Position (3) corresponds to the to the `onPreEncodeVideoFrame` callback.
* Position (4) corresponds to the`onRenderVideoFrame` callback.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

## Implementation
