1.	**Integrate the spatial audio plugin** 

    Take the following steps:
    
    1.	Install the spatial audio plugin.
    
        In your project directory execute the following command:

        ```bash
        npm install agora-extension-spatial-audio
        ```

    1.	Import the spatial audio extension module. 
    
        Add the following `import` statement to your `main.js` file:

        ```javascript
        import {SpatialAudioExtension} from agora-extension-spatial-audio;
        ```

1.	**Dynamically load `Wasm` and `JS` file dependencies** 
    
    The Spatial audio plugin depends on some `Wasm` and `JS` files. To ensure that the browser can load and run these files properly, take the following steps:
    
    1.	Publish the `Wasm` and `JS` files in the  `node_modules/agora-extension-spatial-audio/external` directory to a `CDN` or static resource server. 
    
        * When you create a `SpatialAudioExtension` object, you pass the URL of the public path. The plugin dynamically loads the dependent files. Ensure the dependent files are in the same public folder.

        * If the URL where the `Wasm` and `JS` files are hosted is inconsistent with the URL where your Web application is hosted, you need to enable the CORS policy for accessing the file domain name.

        * Loading `HTTP` resources under `HTTPS` domain name is prohibited by browser security policy. You cannot put `Wasm` and `JS` files under `HTTP` service.

    1.	If Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled, Chrome and Edge prohibit loading and running `Wasm` files by default. You need to configure CSP according to the browser version:

        * For Chrome 97 and Edge 97 or greater, add `script-src` in options `wasm-unsafe-eval`. For example:
        
            ```html
            <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'">
            ```

        * For browser versions below Chrome 97 and Edge 97, add `script-src` in options `unsafe-eval`.
