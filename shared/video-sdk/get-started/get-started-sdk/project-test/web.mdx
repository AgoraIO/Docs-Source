Take the following steps to run and test the sample code:

1. Open `agoraLogic.js` and update the values for `appId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channel` name you used to generate the token.

1. To configure `webpack`, create a file named `webpack.config.js` in the project folder and copy the following code to the file:

    ```js
    const path = require("path");

    module.exports = {
        entry: "./agoraLogic.js",
        output: {
            filename: "bundledAgoraLogic.js",
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./dist"),
        },
        devServer: {
            static: {
                directory: path.join(__dirname, './'), 
            },
            compress: true,
            port: 9000,
        },
    };
    ```

1. To compile the project with `webpack`, use the following command:
    
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

1. To run the project using the `webpack-dev-server`, execute:

    ```shell
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    Your browser automatically opens the following page:
