First frame output time is the duration between when a user joins a channel and when they first see the remote video. A shorter first frame output time reduces perceived wait time by rendering video more quickly.

This guide describes two best practices to reduce video rendering time in <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />.

## Prerequisites

Complete the steps in the [SDK Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) to build a basic <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> app.


## Understand the tech

To reduce video rendering time, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides the following solutions:

* **Preload and initialize before joining the channel**  
  Complete time-consuming operations ahead of time, such as preloading the channel, configuring the rendering view, and enabling accelerated rendering for audio and video frames.

* **Join early, subscribe later**  
  Join the channel in advance but delay subscribing to the audio and video stream. When the user triggers the join operation, subscribe to the host's stream and begin rendering immediately.

The following table compares both solutions:

| Characteristic       | Preload and initialize early   | Join early, subscribe on demand  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------|--------------------------------- |
| Applicable scenarios | Most audio and video use cases | Scenarios with very high requirements for first frame rendering speed  |
| Core implementation  | Initialize and configure video settings before joining | Join the channel early without subscribing; subscribe only when needed |
| Cost   | Normal billing             | May incur additional channel usage fees    |


The following figure shows the time to output the first frame before optimization and with each solution:

## Implement fast first-frame rendering

This section describes the implementation logic for both solutions.

## Troubleshooting
