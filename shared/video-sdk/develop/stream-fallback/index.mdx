In situations with poor network conditions, the quality of audio and video may degrade. When the network is unstable and it's difficult to maintain both audio and video quality, <Vg k="VSDK"/> automatically adjusts by lowering the video quality or, if necessary, switching to audio-only mode to ensure better audio performance.

## Understand the tech

In <Vpd k='PRODUCT'/>, dual-stream mode involves transmitting two video streams simultaneously from the sender's end, each with a different resolution. One stream is optimized for devices with larger screens or better network conditions, while the other is tailored for smaller screens or poorer network conditions.

When stream fallback is enabled, the system intelligently switches between the high-quality and low-quality streams based on network conditions. This dynamic adjustment ensures optimal performance during <Vpd k='PRODUCT'/> sessions, adapting in real-time to varying network bandwidths and device capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.
