This section introduces the pricing policy for <Vg k="SIG"/>.

The pricing of <Vg k="SIG"/> will change soon. For more information, contact sales@agora.io.
Your pricing details may differ if you have signed a contract with <Vg k="COMPANY" />.

## Overview

Pricing for <Vg k="SIG"/> begins once you implement the signaling functionality using <Vg k="MESS_SDK"/>. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates the pricing of all projects under your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account monthly. For details, see [Billing, fee deduction, and account suspension](../reference/billing-policies).

## Calculation

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your monthly pricing by adding up the highest number of **daily active users (DAUs)** for the month of each <Vg k="SIG" /> project in your [<Vg k="CONSOLE" /> developer account](https://console.agora.io/).

## Pricing

| Highest number of DAUs for the month | Price ($US/1,000 DAUs) |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| ≤ 1,000                              | 0                      |
| &gt; 1,000                           | 14.50                  |

## Example

### One project

A user uses <Vg k="SIG"/>, and the highest number of DAUs for the month is 9,000. Because the first 1,000 in the highest number of DAUs for the month are free of charge, the number of DAUs used to calculate the monthly billing is 8,000. Therefore, the monthly billing for <Vg k="SIG" /> is 8,000 (DAUs) / 1,000 (DAUs) × $14.50 = $116.

### Two projects

A user uses <Vg k="SIG"/> in project A and project B. The highest number of DAUs for the month in project A is 9,000, and the highest number of DAUs for the month in project B is 5,000. Because the first 1,000 in the highest number of DAUs for the month are free of charge, the number of DAUs used to calculate the monthly billing is 9,000 + 5,000 - 1,000 = 13,000. Therefore, the monthly billing for <Vg k="SIG" /> is 13,000 (DAUs) / 1,000 (DAUs) × $14.50 = $188.5.
