### Manage the chat group shared files

#### Upload chat group shared files

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.groupManager.uploadGroupSharedFile(

```

#### Delete chat group shared files

All chat group members can call `removeGroupSharedFile` to delete shared files in a chat group. Once a shared file is deleted, all the other chat group members receive the `ChatGroupManagerListener#onSharedFileDeletedFromGroup` callback. The chat group owner and chat group admins can delete all of the shared files, whereas chat group members can only delete the shared files that they have personally uploaded.

The following code sample shows how to delete chat group shared files:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.groupManager.removeGroupSharedFile(

    pageNum: pageNum,
    pageSize: pageSize,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Update the chat group extension fields

Only the chat group owner and admins can call `updateGroupExtension` to update the extension fields of a chat group. The extension fields enable users to perform customized operations on a chat group. The maximum length of each extension field is 8 KB, and it must be in the JSON format.
