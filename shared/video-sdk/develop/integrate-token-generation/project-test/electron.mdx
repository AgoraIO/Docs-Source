1.  In the sample code, set the variables `appId`, and `appCertificate` to values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2.  Set `channelName` and `expirationTimeInSeconds` to the name of the channel to join and the renew time for the token.

3.  For the purpose of this test, set `uid` equal to zero.

4.  Use the `node <file-name>.js` command to run your project.

    The code generates two RTC tokens and prints them to the console. The first token is generated using an integer `uid` and the second token is generated using a `userAccount` string.

5.  Use the token to connect to a <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel.

    1.  In your browser, navigate to <Vg k="DEMO-PAGE-LINK" />.

    2.  Fill in the *App ID*, and *Channel* with the same values that were used to call the RTC token generation method.

    3.  Copy the RTC uid authentication token from the terminal and paste it into the demo page.

    4.  Press **Join** to connect.

        You see the local video on the screen.

6.  Connect to the same channel from another device to confirm that everything works.
