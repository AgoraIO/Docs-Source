This page shows you how to configure volume settings for audio recording, audio playback, and for the playback of music files.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> supports adjusting the audio volume for both recording and playback to meet practical application scenarios. For example, during a two-person call, you can mute a remote user by adjusting the playback volume setting to 0.

The figure below shows the workflow of adjusting the volume.

**Playback** refers to transmitting an audio signal from a sender to a recipient, where it is played back through a playback device.

<PlatformWrapper platform={["android","ios"]}>
**In-ear monitoring** refers to the process of playing audio captured by a device.
</PlatformWrapper>

**Recording** refers to the process in which audio signals are captured by a recording device and then sent to the transmitter.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">If you set the volume too high using the signal volume adjustment methods, it may lead to audio distortion on some devices.</Admonition>
