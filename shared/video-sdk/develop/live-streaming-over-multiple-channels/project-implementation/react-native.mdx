This section shows you how to implement the following methods of multi-channel streaming:

-   [Channel media relay](#channel-media-relay)

-   [Join multiple channels](#implement-joining-multiple-channels)

Choose the method that best suits your scenario and follow the step by step procedure.

### Channel media relay

In this example, you use a single `Button` to start and stop channel media relay.

#### Implement the user interface

To enable your users to start and stop relaying to another channel, add a button to the user interface. In `<View style={styles.btnContainer}>`, add the following code after `<Text onPress={leave} style={styles.button}>Leave</Text>`:

```html
<Text onPress={coHost} style={styles.button}>
    Start Channel Media Relay
</Text>
```

#### Handle the system logic

In your project, import the relevant libraries and declare the required variables.

1.  **Add the required libraries**

    To implement media relay, import the corresponding <Vg k="COMPANY" /> modules. In `App.tsx`, add the following imports before `createAgoraRtcEngine,`:

    ```ts
    ChannelMediaRelayEvent,
    ChannelMediaRelayState,
    ```

2.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To store source and destination channel settings and manage channel relay, in `App.tsx`, add the following variables to the declarations:

    ```ts
    const destChannelName = '<name of the destination channel>';
    const destChannelToken = '<access token for the destination channel>';
    const destUid = 100; // User ID that the user uses in the destination channel.
    var mediaRelaying = false;
    ```

#### Implement channel media relay

To enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to relay channel media to a destination channel, take the following steps:

1.  **Start or stop channel media relay**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts relaying media from the source channel to the destination channel. If channel media relay is already running, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> stops it. To integrate this workflow, in `App.tsx`add the following method after `const leave = () => {}`:

    ```ts
    const coHost = () => {
        if (mediaRelaying) {
            agoraEngineRef.current?.stopChannelMediaRelay();
        } else {
        // Start relaying media streams across channels
            agoraEngineRef.current?.startChannelMediaRelay({
                // Configure the source channel information.
                srcInfo: {
                    channelName: channelName,
                    token: token,
                    uid: uid,
                },
                // Configure the destination channel information.
                destInfos: [
                {
                    channelName: destChannelName,
                    token: destChannelToken,
                    uid: destUid,
                },
                ],
                // The number of destination channels. You can relay media upto 4 channels.
                destCount: 1,
            });
        }
    };
    ```

2.  **Monitor the channel media relay state**

    To receive the state change notifications sent during media relay, you add a callback to `EventHandles`. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> responds to connection and failure events in the
    `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged` event handler. In `App.tsx`, add the following method after `onUserOffline: (_connection, remoteUid) => {}`:

    ```ts
    onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged: (state, code) => {
        // This example shows toast messages when the relay state changes,
        // a production level app needs to handle state change properly.
        switch (state) {
        case ChannelMediaRelayState.RelayStateConnecting: // RELAY_STATE_CONNECTING:
            console.log('Channel media relay connecting.');
            break;
        case ChannelMediaRelayState.RelayStateRunning: // RELAY_STATE_RUNNING:
            mediaRelaying = true;
            console.log('Channel media relay running.');
            break;
        case ChannelMediaRelayState.RelayStateFailure: // RELAY_STATE_FAILURE:
            mediaRelaying = false;
            console.log('Channel media relay failure. Error code: ' + code);
        }
    },
    ```

3.  **Monitor channel media relay events**

    To receive notifications of important channel relay events such as network disconnection, reconnection, and users joining channels, you add the `onChannelMediaRelayEvent` callback to `EventHandles`. In `App.tsx`, add the following method after `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged: (state, code) => {}`:

    ```ts
    onChannelMediaRelayEvent: code => {
        switch (code) {
            case ChannelMediaRelayEvent.RelayEventNetworkDisconnected: // RELAY_EVENT_NETWORK_DISCONNECTED
                console.log(
                'User disconnected from the server due to a poor network connection.',
                );
                break;
            case ChannelMediaRelayEvent.RelayEventNetworkConnected: // RELAY_EVENT_NETWORK_CONNECTED
                console.log('Network reconnected');
                break;
            case ChannelMediaRelayEvent.RelayEventPacketJoinedSrcChannel: // RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_JOINED_SRC_CHANNEL
                console.log('User joined the source channel');
        }
    },
    ```

### Join multiple channels

The alternate approach to multi-channel live streaming is joining multiple channels. In this section, you learn how to implement joining a second channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

#### Implement the user interface

In this example, you need a button to join and leave a second channel. In `<View style={styles.btnContainer}>`, add the following code after `<Text onPress={leave} style={styles.button}>Leave</Text>`:
```html
<Text onPress={multipleChannels} style={styles.button}>
    Join Second Channel
</Text>
```

#### Handle the system logic

In your project, import the relevant libraries and declare the required variables.

1.  **Add the required libraries**

    1. To implement media relay, in `App.tsx`, add the following imports before `createAgoraRtcEngine,`:

    ```ts
    ChannelMediaOptions,
    IRtcEngineEx,
    RtcConnection,
    ```

    2. Remove the library `IRtcEngine` as it will be replaced with `IRtcEngineEx`.

2.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To join and manage a second channel, in `App.tsx`, add the following variables to the declarations:

    ```ts
    var rtcSecondConnection: RtcConnection;
    const secondChannelName = '<-----Insert second channel name------>';
    const secondChannelUid = 100; // Uid for the second channel
    const secondChannelToken =
    '<-------------Insert second token-------------->';
    var isSecondChannelJoined = false; // Track connection state of the second channel
    ```

#### Implement joining multiple channels

To add multi-channel functionality to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1.  **Use the multi-channel enabled `IRtcEngineEx` interface**

    In the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> code, the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance was declared as `IRtcEngine`. To implement multi-channel functionality, you use the multi-channel interface of the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> `IRtcEngineEx`. In order to switch to the multi-user interface, do the following:

    1. Replace `const agoraEngineRef = useRef<IRtcEngine>(); // Agora engine instance` with:
    
        ```ts
        const agoraEngineRef = useRef<IRtcEngineEx>(); // Agora engine instance
        ```

    1. Replace `agoraEngineRef.current = createAgoraRtcEngine();` with:

        ```ts
        agoraEngineRef.current = createAgoraRtcEngine() as IRtcEngineEx;
        ```

2.  **Join a second channel**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a second channel. If the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is already connected to a second channel, it leaves the channel. To do this, add the following code after the `const leave = () => {}` function:

    ```ts
    const multipleChannels = () => {
        if (isSecondChannelJoined) {
            agoraEngineRef.current?.leaveChannelEx({
                localUid: secondChannelUid,
                channelId: secondChannelName,
            });
            isSecondChannelJoined = false;
            showMessage('You left the second channel');
        } else {
            var mediaOptions = new ChannelMediaOptions();
            if (!isHost) {
                // Audience Role
                mediaOptions.autoSubscribeAudio = true;
                mediaOptions.autoSubscribeVideo = true;
                mediaOptions.clientRoleType = ClientRoleType.ClientRoleAudience;
            } else {
                // Host Role
                mediaOptions.publishCameraTrack = true;
                mediaOptions.channelProfile =
                ChannelProfileType.ChannelProfileLiveBroadcasting;
                mediaOptions.clientRoleType = ClientRoleType.ClientRoleBroadcaster;
            }
            agoraEngineRef.current?.joinChannelEx(
                secondChannelToken,
                {
                localUid: secondChannelUid,
                channelId: secondChannelName,
                },
                mediaOptions,
            );
            isSecondChannelJoined = true;
            showMessage('You joined the second channel');
        }
    };
    ```

3.  **Update the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback**

    To see if you have successfully joined the second channel, update the `onJoinChannelSuccess` callback to print the channel ID for the connection.

    ```ts
    onJoinChannelSuccess: (connection, _Uid) => {
        showMessage(
        'Successfully joined the channel ' + connection.channelId,
        );
        setIsJoined(true);
    },
    ```
