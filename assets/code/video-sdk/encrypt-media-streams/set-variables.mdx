    In a production environment, you retrieve the encryption key and salt from an authentication server. For this code example you generate them locally.

    ```kotlin
    private var encryptionKey = "" // A 32-byte string
    private var encryptionSaltBase64 = "" // A 32-byte Base64 string 
    ```
