<PlatformWrapper platform="flutter">

By default, the SDK connects to the nearest Agora server. Set the `areaCode` property of `RtcEngineContext` when calling the `initialize` method to specify the access area.  After setting the access zone, the SDK only connects to Agora servers in the specified zone(s).

You can set the area to:

* `areaCodeGlob`: Global (Default)
* `areaCodeCn`  : Mainland China
* `areaCodeNa`  : North America
* `areaCodeEu`  : Europe
* `areaCodeAs`  : Asia excluding Mainland China
* `areaCodeJp`  : Japan
* `areaCodeIn`  : India

Refer to the following sample code:

```dart
// Your app only connects to Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
await agoraEngine.initialize(RtcEngineContext(
    areaCode: AreaCode.areaCodeNa.value(),
    appId: appId
));
```
