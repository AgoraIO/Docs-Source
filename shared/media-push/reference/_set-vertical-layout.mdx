If you choose vertical layout (`layoutType` = 1) when using the <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful API, you should be familiar with the following guidelines.

## Large window

- Specify a user ID:
  You can use the `maxResolutionUid` parameter to specify a user ID to display in the large window when you start pushing video media streams. If that user stops pushing or exits the channel, the window initially displays the last frame of the user's video. Once the layout refreshes, the window displays the background color of the canvas.
- Let volume determine the user dynamically:
  If no user ID is specified, every time the layout is refreshed, the user with the loudest volume displays in the large window.

## Small windows

Users display in the small windows in the order they join the channel. If a user in a small window exits the channel, the next user in order moves to the window of the user, and this process is repeated for the other users below them.

## Empty windows

When the users in the small windows send only audio streams or stop publishing video streams for some reason, what displays is determined as follows:

- If the `defaultPlaceholderImageUrl` field is set, the default background image is displayed.
- If the defaultPlaceholderImageUrl field is not set, the window initially displays the last frame of the user's video (if available). Once the layout refreshes, the window displays the background color of the canvas.

<Admonition type="info"> These options also apply if a window is empty because there are not enough users in the channel to fill it.</Admonition>

## Screen layouts

The layout configurations vary based on the number of users in the channel, as shown in the following figures:

| Number of people | Layout effect                                                | Description                                                  |
