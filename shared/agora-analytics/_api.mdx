Before working with the RESTful APIs, review the <Vpd k="NAME"/> features in <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> to gain a visual understanding of the quality and usage metrics that are available. For details, see the following user guides:

-   [Call Inspector](#call-inspector)

-   [Data Insights](#data-insights)

<Admonition type="info">
To use Agora Analytics RESTful APIs, subscribe to an <a href="../overview/pricing">Agora Analytics pricing plan</a>.
</Admonition>

## Authentication

Before using the Agora RESTful API, you need to pass the [basic HTTP authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).

## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Request: The request uses query string parameters in the URL.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.

## Call Inspector

With the Call Inspector RESTful APIs, you can search for calls with quality issues and obtain detailed metrics about call quality.

### API limits

The limits of the Call Inspector RESTful APIs depend on the [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/overview/pricing) you subscribe to.

The Starter, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise pricing plans have the following differences in terms of API limits:

<Admonition type="info">
- Request frequency is calculated using the server's UTC time.
- Data delay refers to the time required from the generation of data to the point where it can be queried.
</Admonition>

- Endpoint is `/beta/analytics/call/lists`:

## Data Insights

With the Data Insights RESTful APIs, you can query the usage and quality metrics within a specified time frame.

### API limits

The limits of the Data Insights RESTful APIs depend on the [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/overview/pricing) you subscribe to.

The Starter, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise pricing plans have the following differences in terms of API limits:

## <a name="monitor"></a>Real-time Monitoring

With the Real-time Monitoring RESTful APIs, you can query the scale and quality metrics within a specified time frame. The granularity of the returned data is seconds, which can reflect the actual situation in close to real time.

The data is returned in regular 20-second time windows starting from 00:00:00. For example, [00:00:00, 00:00:20] is a time window, while [00:00:10, 00:00:30] is not a time window.

### API limits

The limits of the Real-time Monitoring RESTful APIs depend on the [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/overview/pricing) you subscribe to.

### <a name="20scale"></a>Query top 20 real-time scale metrics

This method queries the top 20 grouped data of real-time scale for a specified dimension and provides content input for the `dimensionValues` parameter in [Query real-time scale](#realtimescale).

 - Method: `GET`
 - Endpoint: `/beta/realtime/usage/dimension/top20`

#### Query parameters

The following query string parameters are required in the URL:

| **Parameter** | Type   | **Description**                                              |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appid`       | String | The [App ID](./reference/glossary#app-id) of your project. |
| `ts`     | Number | The start point (Unix timestamp) of the time frame to query. The actual query range is [ts, ts + 20s]. |
| `productType` | String | The product for which you want to query the metrics. You can set it to:<li>`Native`: The Agora Video SDK for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.</li><li>`WebRTC`: The Agora Video SDK for Web.</li> |
| `metric`      | String | The metric you want to query. You can only set it `userCount`, namely the number of users. One user ID in one channel is counted as one user, while one user ID in multiple channels is counted as multiple users. |
| `dimension` | String | The dimension to be used for aggregation. Only single-dimensional values are supported, and the following values are allowed: <li>`country`: Country. </li><li>`region`: Region. </li><li>`net`: Network type. </li><li>`sdk`: SDK version. </li><li>`os`: Operating system. </li><li>`device`: Device model. </li>If this parameter is set, the request will return the top 20 (top 50 for `device` dimension) values in the corresponding dimension by default. |
