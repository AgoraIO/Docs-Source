This page lists the error and status codes you may encounter when using the <Vpd k="NAME"/> RESTful APIs. In case of other errors, contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Response status codes

When calling <Vpd k="NAME"/> RESTful APIs, you may receive the following HTTP status codes:

- `200` for a successful request.
- Not `200` for a failed request. In this case, check the `message`, `code`, and `reason` fields in the response body to figure out what has happened. The `reason` field might be absent.

### Response examples

When a request fails, you may receive the following response:

- Only `message`:

    ```json
    # 401 Unauthorized
    # only message
    {
      "message": "Invalid authentication credentials"
    }
    ```

- Only `code` and `reason`:

    ```json
    # 400 Bad Request
    # only code and reason
    {
      "code": 2,
      "reason": "Acquire: invalid resourceExpiredHour value!"
    }
    ```

### Status codes

|Code | Description |
|:----|:------------|
|`200`  |   The request is successful. To call `acquire`, record `tokenName`. To call `start`, record `taskId` and map it to `tokenName`.|
|`201`  |	The service is already running. Do not repeat the `start` request with the same `tokenName`. |
|`206`  |	No host in the channel sent a stream during the transcribing process. |
|`400`  |	The server cannot process the request due to malformed request syntax, or the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service is not enabled.|

|`504`  |	Internal communication error. |


### Error messages and codes

#### Message

- `"the product name does not match with builderToken"`: The acquired `buildToken` has an issue. Call `acquire` again.
- `"resourceId reaches out the limited time interval!"`:  The `buildToken` expired after the 5-minute validity period. Make sure to use `tokenName` to start the service within 5 minutes after calling `acquire`. When the task has been created successfully, save the `tokenName`, since it will be used to call `query`, `update`, and `stop`.
- `"invalid_appid!"`: The <Vpd k="NAME"/> service is not enabled for your app. Enable it in the Console or send a request to [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).
- `"body schema check fail, ..."`: The `start` or `update` body is wrong. `"..."` describes the reason of failure. Always caused by parameter mismatch or exceeding the range. Recheck the request body.
- `"The taskId does not match with builderToken."`: Check why `taskId` and `tokenName` do not match.
- `"The task is not found"`: The task has been terminated.
- `"The task has been started, current status is STARTED, taskId is ..."`: The task has been started. Record `taskId` and map it to `tokenName`.

#### Error code

- `1`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `2`: Invalid parameter. Possible reasons:
    - Wrong data type.
    - Wrong spelling. All parameters are case sensitive.
    - Parameter value is out of range.
    - Mandatory parameter is missing.
- `6`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `20`: Caused by processing timeout. Retry the same call with the back-off strategy, after 3 and 6 seconds.
- `23`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `49`: Caused by repeated `start` requests with the same `tokenName` or repeated `stop` requests with the same `tokenName` and `taskId`.
- `53`: `taskid` and `buildtoken` do not match.
- `62`: If you receive this error when calling `acquire`, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service is not enabled for your App ID. Enable it in the Console or contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). If you receive this error when calling `start`, it means the service is not started due to a network issue.
- `404`: The task has been terminated when calling `query` or `stop`.
- `501`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `502`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `504`: Internal server error when calling `start`. Contact [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need more support.
- `1001`: Failed to parse `tokenName`. Call `acquire` to get a new `tokenName`.
- `1003`: The App ID or `taskId` does not match `tokenName`. Ensure that the App ID or `taskId` matches `tokenName` in each <Vpd k="NAME"/> task.

### Notes

- The `resourceId` and `tokenName` parameters are the same. In some cases, `builderToken` also means `tokenName`.
