<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="vUIK" /> makes it easy to add video calling to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in minutes. <Vg k="vUIK" /> is an Open Source project that includes best practices for business logic, as well as a pre-built video UI. Every piece is customizable, so the developer has full control over how the video call looks and feels.

See the Open Source <Vg k="vUIK"/> projects on GitHub [here](<Vg k="UIKIT_GH_HUB"/>).

This page outlines the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="NAME"/> functionality into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with a customizable UI.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="vUIK" /> simplifies the implementation of <Vpd k="NAME"/> by handling common calling logic such as remote user status, and displaying that in a pre-built customizable UI. <Vg k="vUIK" /> contains the following components:

![Image](/images/video-calling/video-call-uikit.png)

To use <Vg k="UIK" />, you implement the following steps in your app:

1.  **Create an instance of the viewer**

    Declare and initialize an instance of the <Vg k="UIK" /> viewer.

2.  **Join a channel**

    When you execute the `join` command, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.

    Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

## Project setup

To integrate {props.product} into your {props.client} using <Vg k="UIK" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="NAME"/>

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="NAME"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
