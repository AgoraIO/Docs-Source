## v1.3.0

v1.3.0 was released on XXXX, 2024.

#### New features

- Added the `ChatManager#asyncDeleteAllMsgsAndConversations` method to uni-directionally clear all conversations and messages in them. Meanwhile, you can choose whether to clear the chat history on the server.
- Added the function of searching for messages by search scope in `Conversation.ChatMessageSearchScope` during keyword-based search.
  - `Conversation.ChatMessageSearchScope`: Includes three message search scopes: the message content, message extension information, and both. 
  - `ChatManager#searchMsgFromDB(String, long, int, String, Conversation.SearchDirection, Conversation.EMMessageSearchScope)`: Searches for messages in all conversations by search scope.
  - `Conversation#searchMsgFromDB(String, long, int, String, Conversation.SearchDirection, Conversation.EMMessageSearchScope)`: Searches for messages in a conversation by search scope.
- Added the function of marking a conversation: 
  - `ChatManager#asyncAddConversationMark`: Marks a conversation.

  - `ChatManager#asyncGetConversationsFromServerWithCursor`: Gets conversations from the server by conversation mark.
  - `Conversation#marks`: Gets all marks of a local conversation.
  - `MultiDeviceListener#CONVERSATION_MARK_UPDATE`: Conversation mark update event in a multi-device login scenario. If a user adds or removes a conversation mark on one device, this event is received on other devices of the user.
- Added the `ChatMessage#isBroadcast` property to indicate whether the message is a broadcast message sent via a RESTful API to all chat rooms under an app.
- Added `ChatMessage#deliverOnlineOnly` and `ChatMessage#isDeliverOnlineOnly` methods to set whether the message is delivered only when the recipient(s) is/are online. If this field is set to `true`, the message is discarded when the recipient is offline.
- Added the `GroupManager#asyncGetJoinedGroupsCountFromServer` method to allow the current user to retrieve the total number of joined groups.
- Added the error code 706 `CHATROOM_OWNER_NOT_ALLOW_LEAVE` that occurs when chat room owner leaves the chat room. If `ChatOptions#allowChatroomOwnerLeave` is set to `false` during SDK initialization, the chat room is not allowed to leave the chat room. In this case, error 706 is reported if the chat room owner calls the `leaveChatRoom` method to leave the chat room.
- Added the support for retrieval of historical messages of chat rooms from the server.
- Added the `ChatOptions#setUseReplacedMessageContents` method to determine whether the server returns the adjusted text message to the sender if the message content is replaced during text moderation.

  - `MessagePinInfo`: Includes the operator that pins or unpins the message and the operation time.
  - `ChatMessage#pinnedInfo`: Includes the message pinning information.
  - `MessageListener#onMessagePinChanged`: Occurs when the message pinning status changed. When a message is pinned or unpinned in a group or chat room, all members in the group or chat room receive this event. 
- Added the `ChatOptions#setLoadEmptyConversations` method to set whether to include empty conversations in the retrieved list of local conversations. This method is called during SDK initialization.
- Added the `applicant` and `decliner` parameters to the `GroupChangeListener#onRequestToJoinDeclined` event to respectively indicate the user that applies to join the group and the user that declines the join request. 
- Added the `ChatOptions#setIncludeSendMessageInMessageListener` method to set whether to return the successfully sent message in the `MessageListener#onMessageReceived` event.
- Added the support for returning the modified custom message via the `MessageListener#onMessageContentChanged` event if the message is modified via the RESTful API. 
- Added the support for the dynamic loading of .so library files.

#### Improvements

- Delivered a more accurate chat room member count by optimizing the way to update the member count when members join or leave the chat room.

- Marked the `ChatClient#loginWithAgoraToken` method deprecated. Use the `ChatClient#loginWithToken` method instead.
- Fine tuned the error message for token-based login for the sake of accuracy.
- Optimized the way messages are resent.
- Removed the internal `NetworkOnMainThreadException` exception catching during a network request.
- Optimized the database upgrade logic.
- Removed the FPA function and recompiled the boringssl, cipherdb, and libevent libraries to diminish the size of the SDK.
- Increased the maximum allowed size of a log file from 2 MB to 5 MB.
- Allowed users to get the general mute status of groups (the value of `isAllMemberMuted`) locally upon login by storing the status in the local database. 

#### Issues fixed

- For a modified message, the `from` property is missing from the body of the message pulled from the server by an offline user that gets online. 
- In special scenarios, chat room events are missing when users exit the SDK before login to it.
- The SDK reconnects to the server twice after the network is back to normal.
- An incorrect error message is returned for an unlogged-in user that calls the `leaveChatRoom` method.
