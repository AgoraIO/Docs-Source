### Implement the user interface

In a real-word application, you provide several buttons to enable a user to open, play, pause and stop playing files in the media player. In this page, you use a single button to demonstrate the basic media player functions. You also add a `Slider` that displays the play progress to the user and enables them to skip back or forward.

To add the UI elements, in `/lib/main.dart`.

1. Add the following code to the `build` method after `ListView(...children: [`:

    ``` dart
    _mediaPLayerButton(),
    Slider(
        value: _seekPos.toDouble(),
        min: 0,
        max: _duration.toDouble(),
        divisions: 100,
        label: '${(_seekPos / 1000.round())} s',
        onChanged: (double value) {
        _seekPos = value.toInt();
        _mediaPlayerController.seek(_seekPos);
        setState(() {});
        }),
    ```

1. The `_mediaPLayerButton` widget displays a suitable caption on a button depending on the state of the media player. To define this widget, add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    Widget _mediaPLayerButton() {
        String caption = "";

        if (!_isUrlOpened) {
            caption = "Open media file";
        } else if (_isPaused) {
            caption = "Resume playing media";
        } else if (_isPlaying) {
            caption = "Pause playing media";
        } else {
            caption = "Play media file";
        }

        return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _isJoined ? () => {playMedia()} : null,
          child: Text(caption),
        );
    }
    ```

### Handle the system logic

To setup your project to use the media player APIs, take the following steps:

**Declare the variables you need**

    To create and manage an instance of the `MediaPlayerController` and configure the UI elements, add the following declarations to the `_MyAppState` class after `late RtcEngine agoraEngine;`:

    ``` dart
    late final MediaPlayerController _mediaPlayerController;
    String mediaLocation =
      "https://www.appsloveworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/640.mp4";

    bool _isUrlOpened = false; // Media file has been opened
    bool _isPlaying = false; // Media file is playing
    bool _isPaused = false; // Media player is paused

    int _duration = 0; // Total duration of the loaded media file
    int _seekPos = 0; // Current play position
    ```

### Implement media player functions

To implement playing and publishing media files in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1.  **Open, play and pause media files**

    When a user presses the button for the first time, you create an instance of the media player and open the media file. When the user presses the button again, you play the media file. On subsequent button presses, you pause or resume playing the media file alternately. To do this, add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    void playMedia() async {
        if (!_isUrlOpened) {
            await initializeMediaPlayer();
            // Open the media file
            _mediaPlayerController.open(url:mediaLocation, startPos:0);
        } else if (_isPaused) {
            // Resume playing
            _mediaPlayerController.resume();
            setState(() {
                _isPaused = false;
            });
        } else if (_isPlaying) {
            // Pause media player
            _mediaPlayerController.pause();
            setState(() {
                _isPaused = true;
            });
        } else {
            // Play the loaded media file
            _mediaPlayerController.play();
            setState(() {
                _isPlaying = true;
                updateChannelPublishOptions(_isPlaying);
            });
        }
    }
    ```

1.  **Initialize the media player and manage callbacks**

    During initialization, you create an instance of `MediaPlayerController`, initialize it using the `initialize()` method and register a `MediaPlayerSourceObserver` to receive media player callbacks. When the player state changes, you take appropriate actions to update the UI in `onPlayerStateChanged`. You use the `onPositionChanged` callback to update the progress on the Slider. To do this, add the following code to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    Future<void> initializeMediaPlayer() async {
        _mediaPlayerController= MediaPlayerController(
            rtcEngine: agoraEngine,
            useAndroidSurfaceView: true,
            canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: uid,
                sourceType: VideoSourceType.videoSourceMediaPlayer
        )
    );

    await _mediaPlayerController.initialize();

        _mediaPlayerController.registerPlayerSourceObserver(
        MediaPlayerSourceObserver(
            onCompleted: () {

            },
            onPlayerSourceStateChanged:
                (MediaPlayerState state, MediaPlayerError ec) async {
            showMessage(state.name);

            if (state == MediaPlayerState.playerStateOpenCompleted) {
                // Media file opened successfully
                _duration = await _mediaPlayerController.getDuration();
                setState(() {
                _isUrlOpened = true;
                });
            } else if (state == MediaPlayerState.playerStatePlaybackAllLoopsCompleted) {
                // Media file finished playing
                setState(() {
                _isPlaying = false;
                _seekPos = 0;
                // Restore camera and microphone streams
                updateChannelPublishOptions(_isPlaying);
                });
            }
            },
            onPositionChanged: (int position) {
            setState(() {
                _seekPos = position;
            });
            },
            onPlayerEvent:
                (MediaPlayerEvent eventCode, int elapsedTime, String message) {
                // Other events
            },
        ),
        );
    }
    ```

1.  **Configure <Vg k="ENGINE" /> to publish the media player stream**

    You use `ChannelMediaOptions` and the `updateChannelMediaOptions` method to specify the type of stream to publish. To switch between publishing media player and camera and microphone streams, add the following method to the `MainActivity` class:

    ``` dart
    void updateChannelPublishOptions(bool publishMediaPlayer) {
        ChannelMediaOptions channelOptions = ChannelMediaOptions(
            publishMediaPlayerAudioTrack: publishMediaPlayer,
            publishMediaPlayerVideoTrack: publishMediaPlayer,
            publishMicrophoneTrack: !publishMediaPlayer,
            publishCameraTrack: !publishMediaPlayer,
            publishMediaPlayerId: _mediaPlayerController.getMediaPlayerId());

        agoraEngine.updateChannelMediaOptions(channelOptions);
    }
    ```

1.  **Display media player output locally**

    To show the media player output locally, you create an `AgoraVideoView` and set its `controller` to `_mediaPlayerController`. To enable switching between displaying media player output and the camera stream, **replace** the `_localPreview()` method in the `_MyAppState` class with the following:

    ``` dart
    Widget _localPreview() {
        if (_isJoined) {
            if (_isPlaying) {
                return AgoraVideoView(
                controller: _mediaPlayerController,
                );
            } else {
                return AgoraVideoView(
                    controller: VideoViewController(
                        rtcEngine: agoraEngine,
                        canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: 0),
                    ),
                );
            }
        } else {
            return const Text(
                'Join a channel',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            );
        }
    }
    ```

1.  **Clean up when you leave the channel**

    To free up resources when you exit the channel, add the following lines to the `leave` method after `agoraEngine.leaveChannel();`:

    ``` dart
    // Dispose the media player
    _mediaPlayerController.dispose();

    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false;
    });

    _isUrlOpened = false;
    _isPaused = false;
    ```
