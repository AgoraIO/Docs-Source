### Send a text message

Use the `AgoraChatTextMessageBody` class to create a text message, and then send the message.

```objective-c
// Call initWithText to create a text message. Set `content` to the text content.
    AgoraChatTextMessageBody *textMessageBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:content];
    // Set `conversationId` to the user ID of the peer user in one-to-one chat, group ID in group chat, and chat room ID in room chat.
    NSString* conversationId = @"remoteUserId";
    AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:conversationId
                                                          body:textMessageBody
                                                           ext:messageExt];
    // Set `message.chatType` to `AgoraChatTypeChat` for one-to-one chat, `AgoraChatTypeGroupChat` for group chat, and `AgoraChatTypeChatRoom` for room chat.
    // The default value is `AgoraChatTypeChat`.
    message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
    // Send the message.
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
                                                   progress:nil
                                                 completion:nil];
```

You can set the priority of chat room messages.

### Set message priority

In high-concurrency scenarios, you can set a certain message type or messages from a chat room member as high, normal, or low priority.
In this case, low-priority messages are dropped first to reserve resources for the high-priority ones, for example, gifts and announcements, when the server is overloaded.
This ensures that the high-priority messages can be dealt with first when loads of messages are being sent in high concurrency or high frequency.
Note that this feature can increase the delivery reliability of high-priority messages, but cannot guarantee the deliveries.
Even high-priorities messages can be dropped when the server load goes too high.

You can set the priority for all types of messages in the chat room.

```objective-c
AgoraChatTextMessageBody* textBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:@"Hi"];
    AgoraChatMessage* message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:@"roomId" body:textBody ext:nil];
    message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChatRoom;
    // Set the message priority. The default value is `Normal`, indicating the normal priority.
    message.priority = AgoraChatRoomMessagePriorityHigh;
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager sendMessage:message progress:nil completion:nil];
```

### Receive a message

You can use `AgoraChatManagerDelegate` to listen for message events. You can add multiple delegates to listen for multiple events. When you no longer listen for an event, ensure that you remove the listener.

When a message arrives, the recipient receives an `messagesDidReceive` callback. Each callback contains one or more messages. You can traverse the message list, and parse and render these messages in this callback and render these messages.

```objective-c
// Adds the delegate.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager addDelegate:self delegateQueue:nil];
// Occurs when the message is received.
- (void)messagesDidReceive:(NSArray<AgoraChatMessage*> *)aMessages
{
  // Traverse the message list
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aMessages) {
    // Parse the message and display it on the UI
  }
}
// Removes the delegate.
- (void)dealloc
{
  [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager removeDelegate:self];
}
```


### Recall a message

After a message is sent, you can recall it. The `recallMessageWithMessageId` method recalls a message that is saved both locally and on the server, whether it is a historical message, offline message or a roaming message on the server, or a message in the memory or local database of the message sender or recipient.

The default time limit for recalling a message is two minutes. You can extend this time frame to up to 7 days in Agora Console. To do so, select a project that enables Agora Chat, then click **Configure** > **Features** > **Message recall**.

![message-recall](/images/chat/message-recall.png)

```objective-c
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager recallMessageWithMessageId:@"messageId" completion:^(AgoraChatError *aError) {
        if (!aError) {
               NSLog(@"Recalling message succeeds");
           } else {
               NSLog(@"Recalling message fails â€” %@", aError.errorDescription);
           }
    }];
```

You can also use `messagesDidRecall` to listen for the message recall state:

```objective-c
/**
 * Occurs when a received message is recalled.
 */
- (void)messagesInfoDidRecall:(NSArray<AgoraChatRecallMessageInfo *> * _Nonnull)aRecallMessagesInfo;
```

### Send and receive an attachment message

Voice, image, video, and file messages are essentially attachment messages. This section introduces how to send these types of messages.

#### Send and receive a voice message

Before sending a voice message, you should implement audio recording on the app level, which provides the URI and duration of the recorded audio file.

Refer to the following code example to create and send a voice message:

```objective-c
// Set localPath as the local path of the voice file and displayName the display name of the attachment.
AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody alloc] initWithLocalPath:localPath
                          							     displayName:displayName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:nil];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the audio file:

```objective-c
AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *voiceBody = (AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the audio file on the server.
NSString *voiceRemotePath = voiceBody.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the audio file on the local device.
NSString *voiceLocalPath = voiceBody.localPath;
```

#### Send and receive an image message

By default, the SDK compresses the image file before sending it. To send the originial file, you can set `original` as `true`.

Refer to the following code example to create and send an image message:

```objective-c
// Set imageData as the path of the image file on the local device, and displayName as the display name of the file.
AgoraChatImageMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatImageMessageBody alloc] initWithData:imageData
                          							            displayName:displayName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the thumbnail and attachment file of the image message:

```objective-c
AgoraChatImageMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatImageMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the image file on the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the image thumbnail from the server.
NSString *thumbnailPath = body.thumbnailRemotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the image file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
// Retrieves the path of the image thumbnail on the local device.
NSString *thumbnailLocalPath = body.thumbnailLocalPath;
```

<div class="alert note">If <code>[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].options.isAutoDownloadThumbnail</code> is set as <code>YES</code> on the recipient's client, the SDK automatically downloads the thumbnail after receiving the message. If not, you need to call <code>[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageThumbnail:message progress:nil completion:nil];</code> to download the thumbnail and get the path from the <code>thumbnailLocalPath</code> member in <code>messageBody</code>.</div>

#### Send and receive a video message

Before sending a video message, you should implement video capturing on the app level, which provides the duration of the captured video file.

Refer to the following code example to create and send a video message:

```objective-c
// Set localPath as the path of the video file on the local device and displayName the display name of the video file.
AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatVideoMessageBody alloc] initWithLocalPath:localPath displayName:@"displayName"];
// The duration of the video file
body.duration = duration;
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

By default, when the recipient receives the message, the SDK downloads the thumbnail of the video message.

If you do not want the SDK to automatically download the video thumbnail, set `[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].options.isAutoDownloadThumbnail` as `NO`, and to download the thumbnail, you need to call `[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageThumbnail:message progress:nil completion:nil]`, and get the path of the thumbnail from the `thumbnailLocalPath` member in `messageBody`.

To download the actual video file, call `[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageAttachment:progress:completion:]`, and get the path of the video file from the `getLocalUri` member in `messageBody`.

```objective-c
AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the video file from the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the thumbnail of the video file from the server.
NSString *thumbnailPath = body.thumbnailRemotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the video file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
// Retrieves the thumbnail of the video file on the local deivce.
NSString *thumbnailLocalPath = body.thumbnailLocalPath;
```

#### Send and receive a file message

Refer to the following code example to create, send, and receive a file message:

```objective-c
// Set fileData as the path of the file on the local device, and fileName the display name of the attachment file.
AgoraChatFileMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatFileMessageBody  initWithData:fileData
                           							            displayName:fileName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     								                    to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

While sending a file message, refer to the following sample code to get the progress for uploading the attachment file:

```objective-c
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message progress:^(int progress) {
		//progress indicates the progress of uploading the attachment
} completion:^(AgoraChatMessage *message, AgoraChatError *error) {
    //error indicates the result of sending the message, and message indicates the sent message
}];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the attachment file:

```objective-c
AgoraChatFileMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatFileMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the attachment file from the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the attachment file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
```
### Send a location message

To send and receive a location message, you need to integrate a third-party map service provider. When sending a location message, you get the longitude and latitude information of the location from the map service provider; when receiving a location message, you extract the received longitude and latitude information and displays the location on the third-party map.

```objective-c
// Sets the latitude and longitude information of the location.
AgoraChatLocationMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatLocationMessageBody alloc] initWithLatitude:latitude longitude:longitude address:aAddress];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```
### Send and receive a CMD message

CMD messages are command messages that instruct a specified user to take a certain action. The recipient deals with the command messages themselves.
<div class="alert note"><ul><li>CMD messages are not stored in the local database.</li><li>Actions beginning with `em_` and `easemob::` are internal fields. Do not use them.</li></ul></div>

```objective-c
// Use action to customize the CMD message
AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatCmdMessageBody alloc] initWithAction:action];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

To notify the recipient that a CMD message is received, use a seperate delegate so that users can deal with the message differently.

```objective-c
// Occurs when the CMD message is received.
- (void)cmdMessagesDidReceive:(NSArray *)aCmdMessages{
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aCmdMessages) {
        AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *)message.body;
        // Parse the message body
    }
}
```
### Send a customized message

Custom messages are self-defined key-value pairs that include the message type and the message content.
The following code example shows how to create and send a customized message:

```objective-c
// Set event as the custom message event, for example "userCard".
// Set ext as the extension field of the event, for example as uid, nickname, and avatar.
AgoraChatCustomMessageBody* body = [[AgoraChatCustomMessageBody alloc] initWithEvent:@"userCard" ext:@{@"uid":aUid ,@"nickname":aNickName,@"avatar":aUrl}];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                     									                  to:toChatUsername
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
// message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  											   progress:nil
  											 completion:nil];

```
### Use message extensions

If the message types listed above do not meet your requirements, you can use message extensions to add attributes to the message. This can be applied in more complicated messaging scenarios.

```objective-c
AgoraChatTextMessageBody *textMessageBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:content];
// Adds the message extension.
NSDictionary *messageExt = @{@"attribute":@"value"};
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                       from:fromChatUsername
                     																		 to:toChatUsername
                     																	 body:textMessageBody
                                                        ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
  																						 progress:nil
  																					 completion:nil];
// Retrieves the extension when receiving the message
- (void)messagesDidReceive:(NSArray *)aMessages
{
  // Traverse the message list
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aMessages) {
     //value indicates the value of the attribute field in the message extension
     NSString *value = [message.ext objectForKey:@"attribute"];
  }
}
```

### Forward a single message

You can call the `EMChatMessage` constructor method to create a message that is exactly the same as the original message by passing in the message body and extended fields of the original message (if the original message has them), and then call the `EMChatManager#sendMessage` method to forward the message.

You can forward all types of messages in individual chats, group chats, chat rooms, and sub-zones. For attachment type messages, there is no need to re-upload the attachment when forwarding. However, if the message expires (that is, it has been deleted from the server because the storage time has expired), the recipient can view the attachment address after forwarding, but cannot download the attachment.

To forward a single message, refer to the following code:

```objc
// 'message' is the message to be forwarded
if let message = EMClient.shared().chatManager?.getMessage(withMessageId: "messageId") {
  // Create a new message for forwarding using the original message's body and extensions
  let newMessage = EMMessage(conversationID: "conversationId", body: message.body, ext: message.ext)
  EMClient.shared().chatManager?.send(newMessage, progress: nil, completion: { messageResult, err in
    if err == nil {
      // Forwarding message successful
    }
  })
}
```

### Forward multiple messages

To merge multiple messages together for forwarding, you need to take the following steps:

- Create a merged message from the original message list.
- Send the merged message.
- After the peer receives the merged message, it parses it and obtains the original message list. After the merged message is forwarded, the title and preview of the message are displayed on the receiving end.

For forwarding merged messages, for example, user A sends a merged message to user B, and user B forwards the merged message to user C, the API for forwarding a single merged message needs to be called.

#### Create and send multiple messages

You can call `EMCombineMessageBody#initWithTitle:summary:compatibleText:messageList` the method to construct a merged message body, then create the message `EMChatMessage` and call `sendMessage` the method to send the message.

When creating a merged message body, you need to set the following parameters:

| Parameter           | Type | Description  |
| :-------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`  | String | The title of the merged message.  |
| `summary` | String | Summary of merged messages. |
| `compatibleText` | String | Compatible text for merged messages. The compatibility text serves to provide backward compatibility with versions that do not support message merging and forwarding. When an SDK that supports merging messages sends a message to a lower version of the SDK that does not support merging messages, the lower version of the SDK will parse this attribute into the message content of the text message. |
| `messageIdList` | String | List of original message IDs for merged messages. The list contains up to 300 message IDs.|

<Admonition type="caution" title="info">
1. Merged forwarding supports nesting, up to 10 levels of nesting, and a maximum of 300 messages per level.
1. Regardless of whether `EMOptions#isAutoTransferMessageAttachments` is set to `false` or `true`, the SDK will upload the merged message attachments to the environment server.
1. Searching is not supported for merged messages.
</Admonition>

The sample code is as follows:

```objc
EMCombineMessageBody* combineMsgBody = [[EMCombineMessageBody alloc] initWithTitle:@"combineTitle" summary:@"combineSummary" compatibleText:@"combineCompatibleText" messageIdList:@[@"messageId1",@"messageId2"]];
EMChatMessage* msg = [[EMChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:@"conversationId" body:combineMsgBody ext:nil];
[EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager sendMessage:msg progress:nil completion:^(EMChatMessage * _Nullable message, EMError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

The operation of receiving multiple messages is the same as that of receiving ordinary messages.

For SDK versions that do not support merged and forwarded messages, this type of message will be parsed as a text message, the message content will be `compatibleText` the content carried, and other fields will be ignored.

For further details see [Multiple messages forwarding limitations](../../reference/limitations#multiple-messages-forwarding-limitations).

#### Parse merge messages

A merge message is actually an attachment message. After receiving the merged message, you can call `downloadAndParseCombineMessage` the method to download the merged message attachment and parse out the original message list.

For a merged message, the first call to this method will download and parse the merged message attachments, and then return the original message list. Subsequent calls will have the following situations:

- If the attachment already exists, this method will directly parse the attachment and return the original message list.
- If the attachment does not exist, this method first downloads the attachment, then parses the attachment and returns the original message list.

```objc
- (void)messagesDidReceive:(NSArray<EMChatMessage *> *)aMessages
{
    for (EMChatMessage* msg in aMessages) {
        if (msg.body.type == EMMessageBodyTypeCombine) {
            // Merged message type, parse the merged message
            [EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager downloadAndParseCombineMessage:msg completion:^(NSArray<EMChatMessage *> * _Nullable messages, EMError * _Nullable error) {

            }];
        }
    }
}
```

For further details see [Multiple messages forwarding limitations](../../reference/limitations#multiple-messages-forwarding-limitations).

### Modify sent messages

Every end user or chat group member may edit messages that they have sent. The client API below, when called, will allow the SDK to modify a message.

There is no time limit for modifying a message, that is, it can be modified as long as the message is still stored on the server. After the message is modified, the message life cycle, that is, its storage time on the server, is recalculated. For example, a message can be stored on the server for 180 days, and the user modifies it on the 30th day after the message was sent. Instead of remaining 150 days, the message can be now stored on the server for 180 days after successful modification.

In the modified message, the message ID remains unchanged. Only the message content is edited and the following items are added:

* The operator ID of the user performing the action.
* The operation time that indicates when the message was edited.
* The number of times a message is edited (up to 10 times).

For the edited message, except the message body, other information included in the message like the message sender, recipient, and message extension attributes remain unchanged.

To modify a sent message, refer to the following code:
1. Call `modifyMessage` with the message ID and the new message body:
