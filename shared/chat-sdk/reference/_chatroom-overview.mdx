Chat rooms enable real-time messaging among multiple users and are widely applied in live broadcast use cases as stream chat in Twitch. Chat rooms do not have a strict membership, and members do not retain any permanent relationship with each other. Once going offline, chat room members cannot receive any messages from the chat room and automatically leave the chat room after 2 minutes (members on the chat room allow list remain in the chat room even if they stay offline for 2 minutes or more). If you want to adjust the time, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

## Chat room roles and privileges

Chat rooms have the following roles and privileges:

- Chat room members: Regular members that can send and receive chat room messages. 
- Chat room admins: They are specified by the chat group owner. Apart from sending and receiving chat room messages, they have some administrative privileges. You can add up to 99 admins for each chat room.
- Chat room owner: The creator of the chat room. Chat room owners have the highest privileges, including specifying the chat room admin, disbanding the chat room, modifying the chat room attributes, and managing other chat room members.

## Differences between chat group and chat room

Both chat group and chat room support instant messaging among multiple users. The major difference lies in whether mmebers have a stable relationship. Chat group members tend to remain for a long time, whereas chat room members join and leave freely.

The following table shows the feature comparisons between a chat group and a chat room:

| Feature    | Chat group   | Chat room     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where all members have a stable relationship. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream chat channel, this member leaves the chat room.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000 and more  |
| Message push support | Members receive push messages when they go offline. | Members do not receive push messages when they go offline. |
| Offline message storage   | This feature is supported. Agora Chat servers store messages sent to offline group members and sends to them once they go back online. A maximum number of 200 messages across chat groups can be stored per end user.  | Chat room does not store messages sent to offline chat room members and this feature is not supported in chat rooms. |
| Message history  | Agora Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. You can call [this Client API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/client-api/messages/retrieve-messages?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages-of-the-specified-conversation) to allow the SDK to retrieve message history of a chat group. This allows end users to synchronize messages history across multiple end devices.  | Agora Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. Agora Chat currently does not support SDK retrieving message history of a chatroom via client APIs. However, when a user joins a chat room, Agora Chat servers send 10 most recent messages to the client side via the message receiving callback. The number of historical messages sent to the new chat room member can be increased up to 200, without additional charges.|
| Message reliability | Each member receives all the messages in the chat group. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the chat room message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |
