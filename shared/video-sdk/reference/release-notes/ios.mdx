<KnownIssues />

### v4.3.0

v4.3.0 was released on January xx, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release has optimized the implementation of some functions, involving renaming or deletion of some APIs. To ensure the normal operation of the project, you need to update the code in the app after upgrading to this release.

1. **Renaming parameters in callbacks**

   In order to make the parameters in some callbacks and the naming of enumerations in enumeration classes easier to understand, the following modifications have been made in this release. Please modify the parameter settings in the callbacks after upgrading to this release.

   | Callback                           | Original parameter name        | New parameter name |
   | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
   | `localAudioStateChanged`           | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `localVideoStateChanged`           | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `onDirectCdnStreamingStateChanged` | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `didChangedToState`                | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `rtmpStreamingChangedToState`      | `errCode`                      | `reason`                |

   | Original enumeration class      | New enumeration class       |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | `AgoraAudioLocalError`              | `AgoraAudioLocalReason`              |
   | `AgoraLocalVideoStreamError`        | `AgoraLocalVideoStreamReason`        |
   | `AgoraDirectCdnStreamingError`      | `AgoraDirectCdnStreamingReason`      |
   | `AgoraMediaPlayerError`             | `AgoraMediaPlayerReason`             |
   | `AgoraRtmpStreamingError`           | `AgoraRtmpStreamingReason`           |

   **Note:** For specific renaming of enumerations, please refer to [API changes](#api-changes).

2. **Channel media relay**

   To improve interface usability, this release removes some methods and callbacks for channel media relay. Use the alternative options listed in the table below:

   | Deleted methods and callbacks | Alternative methods and callbacks  |
   | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelay`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelay`</li></ul>| `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`   |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelayEx`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelayEx`</li></ul>| `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` |
   | `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent`| `channelMediaRelayStateDidChange`  |

3. **Custom video source**

   Since this release, `pushExternalVideoFrame`[1/2] is migrated from `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` to `AgoraRtcEngineKit`.

4. **Audio route**

   Starting with this release, `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetooth` in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agoraaudiooutputrouting">AgoraAudioOutputRouting</Link> is renamed to `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetoothDeviceHfp`, representing a Bluetooth device using the HFP protocol. `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetoothDeviceA2dp`(10) is added to represent the audio route to a Bluetooth device using the A2DP protocol.

5. **Reasons for local video state changes**

   This release makes the following modifications to the enumerations in the `AgoraLocalVideoStreamReason` class:

   - The `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorEncodeFailure` enumeration has been changed to `AgoraLocalVideoStreamReasonCodecNotSupport`.

#### New features

1. **Custom mixed video layout on the receiving end**

   To facilitate customized layout of mixed video stream at the receiver end, this release introduces the `didTranscodedStreamLayoutInfoUpdatedWithUserId` callback. When the receiver receives the channel's mixed video stream sent by the video mixing server, this callback is triggered, reporting the layout information of the mixed video stream and the layout information of each sub-video stream in the mixed stream. The receiver can set a separate `view` for rendering the sub-video stream (distinguished by `subviewUid`) in the mixed video stream when calling the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setupremotevideo(_:)">setupRemoteVideo</Link> method, achieving a custom video layout effect.

   When the layout of the sub-video streams in the mixed video stream changes, this callback will also be triggered to report the latest layout information in real time.

   Through this feature, the receiver end can flexibly adjust the local view layout. When applied in a multi-person video scenario, the receiving end only needs to receive and decode a mixed video stream, which can effectively reduce the CPU usage and network bandwidth when decoding multiple video streams on the receiving end.

2. **Local preview with multiple views**

   This release supports local preview with simultaneous display of multiple frames, where the videos shown in the frames are positioned at different observation positions along the video link. Examples of usage are as follows:

   1. Call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setuplocalvideo(_:)">setupLocalVideo</Link> to set the first view: Set the `position` parameter to `AgoraVideoModulePositionPostCaptureOrigin` (introduced in this release) in `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`. This corresponds to the position after local video capture and before preprocessing. The video observed here does not have preprocessing effects.
   2. Call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setuplocalvideo(_:)">setupLocalVideo</Link> to set the second view: Set the `position` parameter to `AgoraVideoModulePositionPostCapture` in `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`, the video observed here has the effect of video preprocessing.
   3. Observe the local preview effect: The first view is the original video of a real person; the second view is the virtual portrait after video preprocessing (including image enhancement, virtual background, and local preview of watermarks) effects.

3. **Query Device Score**

   This release adds the `queryDeviceScore` method to query the device's score level to ensure that the user-set parameters do not exceed the device's capabilities. For example, in HD or UHD video scenarios, you can first call this method to query the device's score. If the returned score is low (for example, below 60), you need to lower the video resolution to avoid affecting the video experience. The minimum device score required for different business scenarios is varied. For specific score recommendations, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

4. **Select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming**

   This release introduces the `selectMultiAudioTrack` method that allows you to select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming to remote users. For example, in scenarios like online karaoke, the host can choose to play the original sound locally and publish the accompaniment in the channel. Before using this function, you need to open the media file through the `openWithMediaSource` method and enable this function by setting the `enableMultiAudioTrack` parameter in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agoramediasource">AgoraMediaSource</Link>.

5. **Device test for audio capturing and playback**

   This release introduces the following methods to test whether the audio capturing or playback devices work properly before joining a channel:

   - `startRecordingDeviceTest`: Tests whether the local audio capturing device, such as the speaker, is working properly. After calling this method, the SDK triggers a callback at the time interval set in this method, which reports uid = 0 and the volume information of the capturing device. After the test is completed, you need to call the newly added `stopRecordingDeviceTest` method to stop the test.
   - `startPlaybackDeviceTest`: Tests whether the local audio playback device is working properly. You can specify the audio file to be played through the `testAudioFilePath` parameter and see if your audio device works properly. After the test is completed, you need to call the newly added `stopPlaybackDeviceTest` method to stop the test.

6. **Others**

   This release has passed the test verification of the following APIs and can be applied to the entire series of the SDK v4.x.

   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setremotesubscribefallbackoption(_:)">setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption</Link>: Sets fallback option for the subscribed video stream in weak network conditions.
   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginedelegate/rtcengine(_:didremotesubscribefallbacktoaudioonly:byuid:)">didRemoteSubscribeFallbackToAudioOnly</Link>: Occurs when the subscribed video stream falls back to audio-only stream due to weak network conditions or switches back to the video stream after the network conditions improve.
   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcmediaplayerprotocol/setplayeroption(_:value:)">setPlayerOption [1/2\]</Link> and <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcmediaplayerprotocol/setplayeroptionstring(_:value:)">setPlayerOption [2/2\]</Link>: Sets media player options for providing technical previews or special customization features.
   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/enablecustomaudiolocalplayback(_:enabled:)">enableCustomAudioLocalPlayback</Link>: Sets whether to enable the local playback of external audio source.

#### Improvements

1. **SDK task processing scheduling optimization**

   This release optimizes the scheduling mechanism for internal tasks within the SDK, with improvements in the following aspects:

   - The speed of video rendering and audio playback for both remote and local first frames improves by 10% to 20%.
   - The API call duration and response time are reduced by 5% to 50%.
   - The SDK's parallel processing capability significantly improves, delivering higher video quality (720P, 24 fps) even on lower-end devices. Additionally, image processing remains more stable in scenarios involving high resolutions and frame rates.
   - The stability of the SDK is further enhanced, leading to a noticeable decrease in the crash rate across various specific scenarios.

2. **In-ear monitoring volume boost**

   This release provides users with more flexible in-ear monitoring audio adjustment options, supporting the ability to set the in-ear monitoring volume to four times the original volume by calling <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setinearmonitoringvolume(_:)">setInEarMonitoringVolume</Link>.

3. **Dual-stream mode optimization**

   This release optimizes the video dual-stream mode. In the low-quality video stream adaptive mode (`AgoraAutoSimulcastStream`), when the receiver requests a low-quality video stream by calling <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setremotevideostream(_:type:)">setRemoteVideoStream</Link> or <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartcenginekit/setremotevideostreamex(_:type:connection:)">setRemoteVideoStreamEx</Link>, the sender now processes requests from all users, expanding beyond the previous restriction to hosts only. This change ensures that the audience requests for low-quality video streams are implemented, thus improving the flexibility and adaptability of the dual-stream mode.

4. **Spatial audio effects usability improvement**

   - This release optimizes the design of the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agoraspatialaudiokitbase/setzones(_:)">setZones</Link> method, supporting the ability to set the `zones` parameter to `NULL`, indicating the clearing of all echo cancellation zones.
   - As of this release, it is no longer necessary to unsubscribe from the audio streams of all remote users within the channel before calling methods in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agoralocalspatialaudiokit">AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit</Link>.
   - This release introduces the `updateSelfTransform` method, designed to pass position vectors for direct rendering in iOS native frameworks such as SceneKit or RealityKit.

5. **Local audio state changed callback optimization**

   This release introduces the following enumeration in [AgoraAudioLocalReason](API/enum_localaudiostreamreason.html), enabling users to obtain more details about local audio errors through the `localAudioStateChanged` callback:

   - `AgoraAudioLocalReasonInterrupted`: The local audio capture is interrupted by system calls, Siri, or alarm clocks. Remind your users to end the phone call, Siri, or alarm clock if the local audio capture is required.

6. **Optimization of video pre-processing methods**

   This release adds overloaded methods with the `sourceType` parameter for the following 5 video preprocessing methods, which support specifying the media source type for applying video preprocessing effects by passing in `sourceType` (for example, applying on a custom video capture media source):

   - `setBeautyEffectOptions [2/2\]`
   - `setLowlightEnhanceOptions [2/2\]`
   - `setVideoDenoiserOptions [2/2\]`
   - `setColorEnhanceOptions [2/2\]`
   - `enableVirtualBackground [2/2\]`

7. **Other Improvements**

   This release also includes the following improvements:

   - This release optimizes the SDK's domain name resolution strategy, improving the stability of calling to resolve domain names in complex network environments.
   - When passing in an image with transparent background as the virtual background image, the transparent background can be filled with customized color.
   - This release adds the `earMonitorDelay` and `aecEstimatedDelay` members in [AgoraRtcLocalAudioStats]<Link to="{{Global.API_REF_IOS_ROOT}}/agorartckit/agorartclocalaudiostats)"></Link> to report ear monitor delay and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) delay, respectively.
   - The `cacheStats` callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being cached. This callback is triggered once per second after file caching is started.
   - The `playbackStats` callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being played. This callback is triggered once per second after the media file starts playing. You can obtain information like the audio and video bitrate of the media file through `AgoraMediaPlayerPlaybackStats`.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sharing two screen sharing video streams simultaneously, the reported `captureFrameRate` in the `localVideoStats` callback is 0, which is not as expected.

### v4.2.6

v4.2.6 was released on November 17, 2023.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When using an iOS 16 or later device with Bluetooth headphones connected before joining the channel, the audio routing after joining the channel was not as expected: Audio was played from the speaker, not the Bluetooth headphones.

- In specific scenarios, such as when the network packet loss rate was high or when the broadcaster left the channel without destroying the engine and then re-joined the channel, the video on the receiving end stuttered or froze.

### v4.2.3

v4.2.3 was released on October 11, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Update video screenshot and upload**

   To facilitate the integration of third-party video moderation services from Agora Extensions Marketplace, this version has the following changes:

   - The `AgoraContentInspectTypeImageModeration` enumeration is added in `AgoraContentInspectType` which means using video moderation extensions from Agora Extensions Marketplace to take video screenshots and upload them.
   - An optional parameter `serverConfig` is added in `AgoraContentInspectConfig`, which is for server-side configuration related to video screenshot and upload via extensions from Agora Extensions Marketplace. By configuring this parameter, you can integrate multiple third-party moderation extensions and achieve flexible control over extension switches and other features. For more details, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

   In addition, this version also introduces the `enableContentInspectEx` method, which supports taking screenshots for multiple video streams and uploading them.

1. **Check device support for advanced features**

   This version adds the `isFeatureAvailableOnDevice` method to check whether the capability of the current device meets the requirements of the specified advanced feature, such as virtual background and image enhancement.

   Before using advanced features, you can check whether the current device supports these features based on the call result. This helps to avoid performance degradation or unavailable features when enabling advanced features on low-end devices. Based on the return value of this method, you can decide whether to display or enable the corresponding feature button, or notify the user when the device's capabilities are insufficient.

   In addition, since this version, calling `enableVirtualBackground` and `setBeautyEffectOptions` automatically triggers a test on the capability of the current device. When the device is considered underperformed, the error code -4 is returned, indicating the device does not support the feature.

#### Improvements

1. **Optimize virtual background memory usage**

   This version has upgraded the virtual background algorithm, reducing the memory usage of the virtual background feature. Compared to the previous version, the memory consumption of the app during the use of the virtual background feature on low-end devices has been reduced by approximately 4% to 10% (specific values may vary depending on the device model and platform).

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Optimizes the logic of handling invalid parameters. When you call the `setPlaybackSpeed` method to set the playback speed of audio files, if you pass an invalid parameter, the SDK returns the error code -2, which means that you need to reset the parameter.
- Optimizes the logic of Token parsing, in order to prevent an app from crash when an invalid token is passed in.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional failure of joining a channel when the local system time was not set correctly.
- When calling the `playEffect [3/3]` method to play two audio files using the same `soundId`, the first audio file was sometimes played repeatedly.
- Calling `takeSnapshotEx` once receives the `snapshotTaken` callback for multiple times.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableContentInspectEx`
- `AgoraContentInspectTypeImageModeration` in `AgoraContentInspectType`.
- `serverConfig` in `AgoraContentInspectConfig`
- `isFeatureAvailableOnDevice`
- `AgoraFeatureType`

### v4.2.2

v4.2.2 was released on July 27, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user id. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can avoid repeated application of tokens every time users joining a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow#wildcard-tokens).

   <div class="alert info">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</div>

2. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannelByToken [1/2]` and `preloadChannelByToken [2/2]` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shortening the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear and see the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to avoid repeated application of tokens every time you joining a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow#wildcard-tokens).

3. **Customized background color of video canvas**

   In this release, the `backgroundColor` member has been added to `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`, which allows you to customize the background color of the video canvas when setting the properties of local or remote video display.

4. **Video source types for local preview**

   To allow users in selecting different types of video sources for local video preview, this release introduces `startPreview [2/2]` and `stopPreview [2/2]`. You can call `startPreview [2/2]` and specify the type of video source to be previewed by setting the `sourceType` parameter, and call `stopPreview [2/2]` to stop the video preview.

   <div class="alert info"> The video source type specified in this method must match the video source type set in the `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas` of the `setupLocalVideo` method.</div>

#### Improvements

1. **Improved camera capture effect**

   This release has improved camera capture effect in the following aspects:

   1. Support for camera exposure adjustment

      This release adds `isCameraExposureSupported` to query whether the device supports exposure adjustment and `setCameraExposureFactor` to set the exposure ratio of the camera.

   2. Optimization of default camera selection

      Since this release, the default camera selection behavior of the SDK is aligned with that of the iOS system camera. If the device has multiple rear cameras, better shooting perspectives, zooming capabilities, low-light performance, and depth sensing can be achieved during video capture, thereby improving the quality of video capture.

2. **Virtual Background Algorithm Upgrade**

   This version has upgraded the portrait segmentation algorithm of the virtual background, which comprehensively improves the accuracy of portrait segmentation, the smoothness of the portrait edge with the virtual background, and the fit of the edge when the person moves. In addition, it optimizes the precision of the person's edge in scenarios such as meetings, offices, homes, and under backlight or weak light conditions.

3. **Channel media relay**

   The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

4. **Enhancement in video codec query capability**

   To improve the video codec query capability, this release adds the `codecLevels` member in `CodecCapAgoraVideoCodecCapInfoInfo`. After successfully calling `queryCodecCapability`, you can obtain the hardware and software decoding capability levels of the device for H.264 and H.265 video formats through `codecLevels`.

This release includes the following additional improvements:

1. The SDK automacially adjusts the frame rate of the sending end based on the screen sharing scenario. Especially in document sharing scenarios, this feature avoids exceeding the expected video bitrate on the sending end to improve transmission efficiency and reduce network burden.
2. To help users understand the reasons for more types of remote video state changes, the `AgoraVideoRemoteReasonCodecNotSupport` enumeration has been added to the `remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid` callback, indicating that the local video decoder does not support decoding the received remote video stream.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Slow channel reconnection after the connection was interrupted due to network reasons.
- In screen sharing scenarios, the delay of seeing the shared screen was occasionally higher than expected on some devices.
- In custom video capturing scenarios, `setBeautyEffectOptions`, `setLowlightEnhanceOptions`, `setVideoDenoiserOptions`, and `setColorEnhanceOptions` could not load extensions automatically.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startPreview [2/2]`
- `stopPreview [2/2]`
- `setCameraExposureFactor`
- `isCameraExposureSupported`
- `preloadChannelByToken [1/2]`
- `preloadChannelByToken [2/2]`
- `updatePreloadChannelToken`
- The following members in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`:
  - `publishThirdCameraTrack`
  - `publishFourthCameraTrack`
  - `publishThirdScreenTrack`
  - `publishFourthScreenTrack`
- `AgoraVideoCodecCapLevels`
- `AgoraVideoCodecCapabilityLevel`
- `backgroundColor` in `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`
- `codecLevels` in `CodecCapAgoraVideoCodecCapInfoInfo`
- `AgoraVideoRemoteReasonCodecNotSupport` in `AgoraVideoRemoteReason`

### v4.2.1

This version was released on June 21, 2023.

#### Improvements

This version improves the network transmission strategy, enhancing the smoothness of audio and video interactions.

#### Fixed Issues

This version fixed the following issues:

- Inability to join channels caused by SDK's incompatibility with some older versions of AccessToken.
- After the sending end called `setAINSMode` to activate AI noise reduction, occasional echo was observed by the receiving end.
- Brief noise occurred while playing media files using the media player.
- Occasional crash after calling the `destroyMediaPlayer` method.


### v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May 23, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Video capture**

This release optimizes the APIs for camera and screen capture function. As of v4.2.0, ensure you use the alternative methods listed in the table below and specify the video source by setting the `sourceType` parameter.

| Deleted Methods                                          | Alternative Methods       |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `startSecondaryCameraCapture` | `startCameraCapture`     |
| `stopSecondaryCameraCapture`   | `stopCameraCapture`      |

**2. Video data acquisition**

- The `onCaptureVideoFrame` and `onPreEncodeVideoFrame` callbacks are added with a new parameter called `sourceType`, which is used to indicate the specific video source type.
- The following callbacks are deleted. Get the video source type through the `sourceType` parameter in the `onPreEncodeVideoFrame` and `onCaptureVideoFrame` callbacks.
  - `onScreenCaptureVideoFrame`
  - `onPreEncodeScreenVideoFrame`

**3. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishTrancodedVideoTrack` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishTranscodedVideoTrack`.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**4. Miscellaneous**

- `didApiCallExecute` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- `enableDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `enableDualStreamMode`[2/2] are depredated. Use `setDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `setDualStreamMode`[2/2] instead.
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx` and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**1. AI noise suppression**

This release introduces the AI noise suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise suppression mode as balance, aggressive or low latency according to your scenarios.

**2. Enhanced virtual background**

To increase the fun of real-time video calls and protect user privacy, this version has enhanced the virtual background feature. You can now set custom backgrounds of various types by calling the `enableVirtualBackground` method, including:

- Process the background as alpha information without replacement, only separating the portrait and the background. This can be combined with the local video mixing feature to achieve a portrait-in-picture effect.
- Replace the background with various formats of local videos.

**3. Video scenario settings**

This release introduces `setVideoScenario` for setting the video application scene. The SDK will automatically enable the best practice strategy based on different scenes, adjusting key performance indicators to optimize video quality and improve user experience. Whether it is a formal business meeting or a casual online gathering, this feature ensures that the video quality meets the requirements.

Currently, this feature provides targeted optimizations for real-time video conferencing scenarios, including:

- Automatically activate multiple anti-weak network technologies to enhance the capability and performance of low-quality video streams in meeting scenarios where high bitrates are required, ensuring smoothness when multiple streams are subscribed by the receiving end.
- Monitor the number of subscribers for the high-quality and low-quality video streams in real time, dynamically adjusting the configuration of the high-quality stream and dynamically enabling or disabling the low-quality stream, to save uplink bandwidth and consumption.

**4. Local video mixing**

This release adds the local video mixing feature. You can use the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to mix and render multiple video streams locally, such as camera-captured video, screen sharing streams, video files, images, etc. This allows you to achieve custom layouts and effects, making it easy to create personalized video display effects to meet various scenario requirements, such as remote meetings, live streaming, online education, while also supporting features like portrait-in-picture effect.

Additionally, the SDK provides the `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method and the `didLocalVideoTranscoderErrorWithStream` callback. After enabling local video mixing, you can use the `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method to update the video mixing configuration. Where an error occurs in starting the local video mixing or updating the configuration, you can get the reason for the failure through the `didLocalVideoTranscoderErrorWithStream` callback.

<div class="alert note">Local video mixing requires more CPU resources. Therefore, Agora recommends enabling this function on devices with higher performance.</div>

**5. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `getNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.
#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Enhanced screen share**

This release adds the `queryScreenCaptureCapability` method, which is used to query the screen capture capabilities of the current device. To ensure optimal screen sharing performance, particularly in enabling high frame rates like 60 fps, Agora recommends you to query the device's maximum supported frame rate using this method beforehand.

This release also adds the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method, which is used to set the scenario type for screen sharing. The SDK automatically adjusts the smoothness and clarity of the shared screen based on the scenario type you set.

**3. Audio and video synchronization**

For custom video and audio capture scenarios, this release introduces `getCurrentMonotonicTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Monotonic Time. By passing this value into the timestamps of audio and video frames, developers can accurately control the timing of their audio and video streams, ensuring proper synchronization.

**4. Multi-camera capture**

This release introduces `startCameraCapture`. By calling this method multiple times and specifying the `sourceType` parameter, developers can start capturing video streams from multiple cameras for local video mixing or multi-channel publishing. This is particularly useful for scenarios such as remote medical care and online education, where multiple cameras need to be connected.

**5. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**6. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.
#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host frequently switching the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members cannot hear the audio of the host.
- Occasional loss of the `firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid` callback during channel media relay.
- The receiver actively subscribed to the high-quality stream but unexpectedly received a low-quality stream.
- Abnormal client status cased by an exception in the `onRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback.

### v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on January xx, 2023.


#### Compatibility changes
**1. Default video encoding resolution**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the video encoder algorithm and upgrades the default video encoding resolution from 640 × 360 to 960 × 540 to accommodate improvements in device performance and network bandwidth, providing users with a full-link HD experience in various audio and video interaction scenarios.

You can call the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the expected video encoding resolution in the video encoding parameters configuration.

<div class="alert note">The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./billing_rtc_ng">Pricing</a>.</div>

**2. Options for subscribing to remote video streams**
This release changes the name of `setRemoteVideo` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions`, and the name of `setRemoteVideoEx` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx`. If you upgrade the SDK to this version or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you modify the names of these two methods.

#### New features

**1. Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio and video frames, which can speed up the first video or audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.

**2. Video rendering tracing**

This release adds the `startMediaRenderingTracing` and `startMediaRenderingTracingEx` methods. The SDK starts tracing the rendering status of the video frames in the channel from the moment this method is called and reports information about the event through the `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid` callback.

Agora recommends that you use this method in conjunction with the UI settings (such as buttons and sliders) in your app. For example, call this method at the moment when the user clicks the "Join Channel" button, and then get the indicators in the video frame rendering process through the `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid` callback. This enables developers to facilitate developers to optimize the indicators to improve the user experience.



#### Improvements

**1. Video frame observer**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the `onRenderVideoFrame` callback, and the meaning of the return value is different depending on the video processing mode:

- When the video processing mode is `AgoraVideoFrameProcessModeReadOnly`, the return value is reserved for future use.
- When the video processing mode is `AgoraVideoFrameProcessModeReadWrite`, the SDK receives the video frame when the return value is `YES`; the video frame is discarded when the return value is `NO`.

**2. Super resolution**

This release improves the performance of super resolution. To optimize the usability of super resolution, this release removes `enableRemoteSuperResolution`. Super resolution is now included in the online strategies of video quality enhancement which does not require extra configuration.



#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.
- When there were multiple video streams in a channel, calling some video enhancement APIs occasionally failed.
- At the moment when a user left a channel, a request for leaving was not sent to the server and the leaving behavior was incorrectly determined by the server as timed out.



#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableInstantMediaRendering`
- `startMediaRenderingTracing`
- `startMediaRenderingTracingEx`
- `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid`
- `AgoraMediaRenderTraceEvent`
- `VideoRenderingTracingInfo`

**Modified**
- `setRemoteVideo` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions`
- `setRemoteVideoEx` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx`

**Deleted**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`
- Deleted `superResolutionType` in `AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`

### v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on November xx, 2022.

#### New features

#### **1. Multiple cameras for video capture**

This release supports multi-camera video capture. You can call `enableMultiCamera` to enable multi-camera capture mode, call `startSecondaryCameraCapture` to start capturing video from the second camera, and then publish the captured video to the second channel.

To stop using multi-camera capture, you need to call `stopSecondaryCameraCapture` to stop the second camera capture, then call `enableMultiCamera` and set `enabled` to `NO`.

**2. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call setHeadphoneEQParameters to adjust the EQ.

**3. Encoded video frame observer**

This release adds the `setRemoteVideo` method in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` and `AgoraRtcEngineKitEx` classes. When you call the `setEncodedVideoFrameDelegate` method to register a video frame observer for the encoded video frames, the SDK subscribes to the encoded video frames by default. If you want to change the subscription options, you can call these new methods to set them.

For more information about registering video observers and subscription options, see the API reference.

**4. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

> To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](https://docs.agora.io/cn/video-call-4.x/sales-us@agora.io).

**5. Camera capture options**

This release adds the `followEncodeDimensionRatio` member in `AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration`, which enables you to set whether to follow the video aspect ratio already set in `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` when capturing video with the camera.

**6. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio and video streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` and `muteLocalVideoStreamEx` methods are used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio or video stream, respectively.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` and `muteAllRemoteVideoStreamsEx` are used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio or video streams, respectively.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `leaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `leaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**7. Video encoding preferences**

In general scenarios, the default video encoding configuration meets most requirements. For certain specific scenarios, this release adds the `advancedVideoOptions` member in `VideoEncoderConfiguration` for advanced settings of video encoding properties:

- `compressionPreference`: The compression preferences for video encoding, which is used to select low-latency or high-quality video preferences.
- `encodingPreference`: The video encoder preference, which is used to select adaptive preference, software encoder preference, or hardware encoder video preferences.

**8. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `didClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelLowLatency` (1): Low latency.
- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelUltraLowLatency` (2): Ultra-low latency.

#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventUpdateDestinationChannelRefused`(8), and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**3. Virtual background**

This release optimizes the virtual background algorithm. Improvements include the following:

- The boundaries of virtual backgrounds are handled in a more nuanced way and image matting is is now extremely thin.
- The stability of the virtual background is improved whether the portrait is still or moving, effectively eliminating the problem of background flickering and exceeding the range of the picture.
- More application scenarios are now supported, and a user obtains a good virtual background effect day or night, indoors or out.
- A larger variety of postures are now recognized, when half the body is motionless, the body is shaking, the hands are swinging, or there is fine finger movement. This helps to achieve a good virtual background effect in conjunction with many different gestures.

#### **Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Improves the smoothness of SDK video rendering.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### **Issues fixed**

This release fixed the following issues:

- Calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files in the `ipod-library://item` path failed.
- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.
- Different timestamps for audio and video data were obtained simultaneously and separately via `onRecordAudioFrame` and `onCaptureVideoFrame` callbacks.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
- When entering a live streaming room that has been played for a long time as an audience, the time for the first frame to be rendered was shortened.

### v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on September 15, 2022.

#### New features


**2. Full HD and Ultra HD resolution**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capturing, encoding, decoding and rendering. Starting from this version, it supports Full HD (FHD) and Ultra HD (UHD) video resolutions. You can set the `dimensions` parameter to 1920 × 1080 or higher resolution when calling the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method. If your device does not support high resolutions, the SDK will automatically fall back to an appropriate resolution.

<div class="alert info"><li>The UHD resolution (4K, 60 fps) is currently in beta and requires certain device performance and network bandwidth. If you want to experience this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.</li>
<li>High resolution typically means higher performance consumption. To avoid a decrease in experience due to insufficient device performance, Agora recommends that you enable FHD and UHD video resolutions on devices with better performance.</li>
<li>The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./billing_rtc_ng">Pricing</a>.</li></div>

### v4.2.2

v4.2.2 was released on july 27, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user id. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can avoid repeated application of tokens every time users joining a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

   <div class="alert info">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</div>

2. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannelByToken[1/2]` and `preloadChannelByToken[2/2]` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shortening the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear and see the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to avoid repeated application of tokens every time you joining a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

3. **Customized background color of video canvas**

   In this release, the `backgroundColor` member has been added to `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`, which allows you to customize the background color of the video canvas when setting the properties of local or remote video display.

4. **Video source types for local preview**

   To allow users in selecting different types of video sources for local video preview, this release introduces `startPreview[2/2]` and `stopPreview[2/2]`. You can call `startPreview[2/2]` and specify the type of video source to be previewed by setting the `sourceType` parameter, and call `stopPreview[2/2]` to stop the video preview.

   <div class="alert info"> The video source type specified in this method must match the video source type set in the `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas` of the `setupLocalVideo` method.</div>

#### Improvements

1. **Improved camera capture effect**

   This release has improved camera capture effect in the following aspects:

   1. Support for camera exposure adjustment

      This release adds `isCameraExposureSupported` to query whether the device supports exposure adjustment and `setCameraExposureFactor` to set the exposure ratio of the camera.

   2. Optimization of default camera selection

      Since this release, the default camera selection behavior of the SDK is aligned with that of the iOS system camera. If the device has multiple rear cameras, better shooting perspectives, zooming capabilities, low-light performance, and depth sensing can be achieved during video capture, thereby improving the quality of video capture.

2. **Virtual Background Algorithm Upgrade**

   This version has upgraded the portrait segmentation algorithm of the virtual background, which comprehensively improves the accuracy of portrait segmentation, the smoothness of the portrait edge with the virtual background, and the fit of the edge when the person moves. In addition, it optimizes the precision of the person's edge in scenarios such as meetings, offices, homes, and under backlight or weak light conditions.

3. **Channel media relay**

   The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

4. **Enhancement in video codec query capability**

   To improve the video codec query capability, this release adds the `codecLevels` member in `CodecCapAgoraVideoCodecCapInfoInfo`. After successfully calling `queryCodecCapability`, you can obtain the hardware and software decoding capability levels of the device for H.264 and H.265 video formats through `codecLevels`.

This release includes the following additional improvements:

1. The SDK automacially adjusts the frame rate of the sending end based on the screen sharing scenario. Especially in document sharing scenarios, this feature avoids exceeding the expected video bitrate on the sending end to improve transmission efficiency and reduce network burden.
2. To help users understand the reasons for more types of remote video state changes, the `AgoraVideoRemoteReasonCodecNotSupport` enumeration has been added to the `remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid` callback, indicating that the local video decoder does not support decoding the received remote video stream.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Slow channel reconnection after the connection was interrupted due to network reasons.
- In screen sharing scenarios, the delay of seeing the shared screen was occasionally higher than expected on some devices.
- In custom video capturing scenarios, `setBeautyEffectOptions`, `setLowlightEnhanceOptions`, `setVideoDenoiserOptions`, and `setColorEnhanceOptions` could not load extensions automatically.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startPreview [2/2]`
- `stopPreview [2/2]`
- `setCameraExposureFactor`
- `isCameraExposureSupported`
- `preloadChannelByToken [1/2]`

- `publishTrancodedVideoTrack` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishTranscodedVideoTrack`.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**4. Miscellaneous**

- `didApiCallExecute` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- `enableDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `enableDualStreamMode`[2/2] are deprecated. Use `setDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `setDualStreamMode`[2/2] instead.
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**1. AI Noise Suppression**

This release introduces public APIs for the AI Noise Suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise suppression mode as balance, aggressive, or low latency according to your scenarios.

<div class="alert note">Agora charges separately for this function. See [AI Noise Suppression unit pricing](pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).</div>

**2. Enhanced Virtual Background**

To increase the fun of real-time video calls and protect user privacy, this version has enhanced the Virtual Background function. You can now set custom backgrounds of various types by calling the `enableVirtualBackground` method, including:

- Process the background as alpha information without replacement, only separating the portrait and the background. This can be combined with the local video mixing feature to achieve a portrait-in-picture effect.
- Replace the background with various formats of local videos.

See [Virtual Background documentation](../enable-features/virtual-background).


**3. Video scenario settings**

This release introduces `setVideoScenario` for setting the video application scene. The SDK will automatically enable the best practice strategy based on different scenes, adjusting key performance indicators to optimize video quality and improve user experience. Whether it is a formal business meeting or a casual online gathering, this feature ensures that the video quality meets the requirements.

Currently, this feature provides targeted optimizations for real-time video conferencing scenarios, including:

- Automatically activate multiple anti-weak-network technologies to enhance the capability and performance of low-quality video streams in meeting scenarios where high bitrates are required, ensuring smoothness when multiple streams are subscribed by the receiving end.
- Monitor the number of subscribers for the high-quality and low-quality video streams in real time, dynamically adjusting the configuration of the high-quality stream and dynamically enabling or disabling the low-quality stream, to save uplink bandwidth and consumption.

**4. Local video mixing**

This release adds the local video mixing feature. You can use the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to mix and render multiple video streams locally, such as camera-captured video, screen sharing streams, video files, images, etc. This allows you to achieve custom layouts and effects, making it easy to create personalized video display effects to meet various scenario requirements, such as remote meetings, live streaming, online education, while also supporting features like portrait-in-picture effect.

Additionally, the SDK provides the `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method and the `didLocalVideoTranscoderErrorWithStream` callback. After enabling local video mixing, you can use the `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method to update the video mixing configuration. Where an error occurs in starting the local video mixing or updating the configuration, you can get the reason for the failure through the `didLocalVideoTranscoderErrorWithStream` callback.

<div class="alert note">Local video mixing requires more CPU resources. Therefore, Agora recommends enabling this function on devices with higher performance.</div>

**5. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `getNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.

#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Enhanced screen share**

This release adds the `queryScreenCaptureCapability` method, which is used to query the screen capture capabilities of the current device. To ensure optimal screen sharing performance, particularly in enabling high frame rates like 60 fps, Agora recommends you to query the device's maximum supported frame rate using this method beforehand.

This release also adds the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method, which is used to set the scenario type for screen sharing. The SDK automatically adjusts the smoothness and clarity of the shared screen based on the scenario type you set.

**3. Audio and video synchronization**

For custom video and audio capture scenarios, this release introduces `getCurrentMonotonicTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Monotonic Time. By passing this value into the timestamps of audio and video frames, developers can accurately control the timing of their audio and video streams, ensuring proper synchronization.

**4. Multi-camera capture**

This release introduces `startCameraCapture`. By calling this method multiple times and specifying the `sourceType` parameter, developers can start capturing video streams from multiple cameras for local video mixing or multi-channel publishing. This is particularly useful for scenarios such as remote medical care and online education, where multiple cameras need to be connected.

**5. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**6. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host frequently switched the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members could not hear the audio of the host.
- Occasional loss of the `firstRemoteVideoFrameOfUid` callback during channel media relay.
- The receiver actively subscribed to the high-quality stream but unexpectedly received a low-quality stream.
- Abnormal client status caused by an exception in the `onRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback.

### v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on February 8, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Default video encoding resolution**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the video encoder algorithm and upgrades the default video encoding resolution from 640 × 360 to 960 × 540 to accommodate improvements in device performance and network bandwidth, providing users with a full-link HD experience in various audio and video interaction scenarios.

Call the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the expected video encoding resolution in the video encoding parameters configuration.

<div class="alert note">The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./pricing">Pricing</a>.</div>

**2. Options for subscribing to remote video streams**

This release changes the name of `setRemoteVideo` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions`, and the name of `setRemoteVideoEx` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx`. If you upgrade the SDK to this version or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you modify the names of these two methods.

#### New features

**1. Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio and video frames, which can speed up the first video or audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.

**2. Video rendering tracing**

This release adds the `startMediaRenderingTracing` and `startMediaRenderingTracingEx` methods. The SDK starts tracing the rendering status of the video frames in the channel from the moment this method is called and reports information about the event through the `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid` callback.

Agora recommends that you use this method in conjunction with the UI settings, such as buttons and sliders, in your app. For example, call this method when the user clicks **Join Channel** and then get the indicators in the video frame rendering process through the `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid` callback.
This enables developers to optimize the indicators and improve the user experience.

#### Improvements

**1. Video frame observer**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the `onRenderVideoFrame` callback, and the meaning of the return value is different depending on the video processing mode:

- When the video processing mode is `AgoraVideoFrameProcessModeReadOnly`, the return value is reserved for future use.
- When the video processing mode is `AgoraVideoFrameProcessModeReadWrite`, the SDK receives the video frame when the return value is `YES`. The video frame is discarded when the return value is `NO`.

**2. Super resolution**

This release improves the performance of super resolution. To optimize the usability of super resolution, this release removes `enableRemoteSuperResolution`. Super resolution is now included in the online strategies of video quality enhancement which does not require extra configuration.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.
- When there were multiple video streams in a channel, calling some video enhancement APIs occasionally failed.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableInstantMediaRendering`
- `startMediaRenderingTracing`
- `startMediaRenderingTracingEx`
- `videoRenderingTracingResultOfUid`
- `AgoraMediaRenderTraceEvent`
- `VideoRenderingTracingInfo`

**Modified**
- `setRemoteVideo` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions`
- `setRemoteVideoEx` to `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx`

**Deleted**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`
- `superResolutionType` in `AgoraRtcRemoteVideoStats`

### v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December 15, 2022.

#### New features

#### **1. Multiple cameras for video capture**

This release supports multi-camera video capture. You can call `enableMultiCamera` to enable multi-camera capture mode, call `startSecondaryCameraCapture` to start capturing video from the second camera, and then publish the captured video to the second channel.

To stop using multi-camera capture, you need to call `stopSecondaryCameraCapture` to stop the second camera capture, then call `enableMultiCamera` and set `enabled` to `NO`.

**2. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.

**3. Encoded video frame observer**

This release adds the `setRemoteVideo` method in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` and `AgoraRtcEngineKitEx` classes. When you call the `setEncodedVideoFrameDelegate` method to register a video frame observer for the encoded video frames, the SDK subscribes to the encoded video frames by default. If you want to change the subscription options, you can call these new methods to set them.

For more information about registering video observers and subscription options, see the API reference.

**4. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality. To enable this feature, contact support@agora.io.

**5. Camera capture options**

This release adds the `followEncodeDimensionRatio` member in `AgoraCameraCapturerConfiguration`, which enables you to set whether to follow the video aspect ratio already set in `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` when capturing video with the camera.

**6. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio and video streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` and `muteLocalVideoStreamEx` methods are used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio or video stream, respectively.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` and `muteAllRemoteVideoStreamsEx` are used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio or video streams, respectively.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `leaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `leaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**7. Video encoding preferences**

In general scenarios, the default video encoding configuration meets most requirements. For certain specific scenarios, this release adds the `advancedVideoOptions` member in `VideoEncoderConfiguration` for advanced settings of video encoding properties:

- `compressionPreference`: The compression preferences for video encoding, which is used to select low-latency or high-quality video preferences.
- `encodingPreference`: The video encoder preference, which is used to select adaptive preference, software encoder preference, or hardware encoder video preferences.

**8. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `didClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelLowLatency` (1): Low latency.
- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelUltraLowLatency` (2): Ultra-low latency.

**9. Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (in comparison to the basic AI noise reduction in v3.7.x). The new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option. To experience this feature, contact support@agora.io.

**10. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense of presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listner experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user, respectively, by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation paramter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`, and the receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the hearing of the headphones.

#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventUpdateDestinationChannelRefused`(8), and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**3. Virtual background**

This release optimizes the virtual background algorithm. Improvements include the following:

- The boundaries of virtual backgrounds are handled in a more nuanced way and image matting is is now extremely thin.
- The stability of the virtual background is improved whether the portrait is still or moving, effectively eliminating the problem of background flickering and exceeding the range of the picture.
- More application scenarios are now supported, and a user obtains a good virtual background effect day or night, indoors or out.
- A larger variety of postures are now recognized, when half the body is motionless, the body is shaking, the hands are swinging, or there is fine finger movement. This helps to achieve a good virtual background effect in conjunction with many different gestures.

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Improves the smoothness of SDK video rendering.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### **Issues fixed**

This release fixed the following issues:

- Calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files in the `ipod-library://item` path failed.
- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.
- Different timestamps for audio and video data were obtained simultaneously and separately via `onRecordAudioFrame` and `onCaptureVideoFrame` callbacks.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
- When entering a live streaming room that has been played for a long time as an audience, the time for the first frame to be rendered was shortened.

### v4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

1. To improve code usability, this release changes the parameters in optional type in the following classes to basic data types such as ` bool` and `int`:

- `isAgoraSource` and `isLiveSource` in `AgoraMediaSource` is changed from optional to bool.
- All parameter types in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` are changed from `optional` to `bool` or `int`.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback to set the audio data format of the in-ear monitoring. You can use your own audio effect processing module to pre-process the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. After calling `setAudioFrameDelegate` to register the audio observer, set the audio data format in the return value of the `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the return value of the callback, and triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.

**2. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the `getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use, including UNKNOWN, DISCONNECTED, LAN, WIFI, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `networkTypeChangedToType` callback to report the current network connection type.

 **3. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports 3 audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; you can contact support@agora.io to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Meanwhile, Agora supports publishers to choose whether or not the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered will bypass this filter mechanism and transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios where there are a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reducing the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

To enable this function, contact support@agora.io.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `getEarMonitoringAudioParams`

- `getNetworkType`
- `isAudioFilterable` in the `ChannelMediaOptions`
- `setZones`
- `setPlayerAttenuation`
- `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`
- `muteRemoteAudioStream`
- `SpatialAudioParams`
- `setHeadphoneEQPreset`
- `AgoraHeadphoneEQPreset`

**Deprecated**

- `startEchoTest` [2/3]

### v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on September 15, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

This release has optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v3.7.x. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Custom video capture and rendering (Media IO)
- Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see [Migrate from v3.7.x to v4.0.0](../develop/migration-guide).

#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `AgoraRtcEngineKit` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` and `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`.

- After calling `joinChannelByToken` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelExByToken` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` settings.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**2. Full HD and Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capturing, encoding, decoding and rendering. Starting from this version, it supports Full HD (FHD) and Ultra HD (UHD) video resolutions. You can set the `dimensions` parameter to 1920 × 1080 or higher resolution when calling the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method. If your device does not support high resolutions, the SDK will automatically fall back to an appropriate resolution.

The UHD resolution (4K, 60 fps) is currently in beta and requires certain device performance and network bandwidth. If you want to enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.

High resolution typically means higher performance consumption. To avoid a decrease in experience due to insufficient device performance, Agora recommends that you enable FHD and UHD video resolutions on devices with better performance.

The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./pricing">Pricing</a>.

**3. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayerWithDelegate` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

**4. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `AgoraVoiceBeautifierUltraHighQuality` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**5. Spatial audio**

This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact support@agora.io. Contact [Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io) if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the remote user.
  ![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/video-call-spatial.png)

You can also set the spatial audio for the media player as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.
  ![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/spatial-audio-effect.png)


**6. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AgoraAudioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AgoraAudioScenario`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

**7. Extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace**

In order to enhance the real-time audio and video interactive activities based on the Agora SDK, this release supports the one-stop solution for the extensions from the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.APP_ID_LINK}}/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/">Agora extensions marketplace</Link>:

- Easy to integrate: The integration of modular functions can be achieved simply by calling an API, and the integration efficiency is improved by nearly 95%.
- Extensibility design: The modular and extensible SDK design style endows the Agora SDK with good extensibility, which enables developers to quickly build real-time interactive apps based on the Agora extensions marketplace ecosystem.
- Build an ecosystem: A community of real-time audio and video apps has developed that can accommodate a wide range of developers, offering a variety of extension combinations. After integrating the extensions, developers can build richer real-time interactive functions. For details, see [Use an Extension](../develop/use-an-extension).
- Become a vendor: Vendors can integrate their products with Agora SDK in the form of extensions, display and publish them in the Agora extensions marketplace, and build a real-time interactive ecosystem for developers together with Agora. For details on how to develop and publish extensions, see [Become a Vendor](/extensions-marketplace/get-started/quickstart-implement).

**8. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannelByToken` or `joinChannelExByToken` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to update the settings in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio sources.

**9. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function in the following ways.

- Call the `StartScreenCapture` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannelByToken` [2/4] to join a channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `YES`.
- Call the `StartScreenCapture` method after joining a channel, and then call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `YES`.

**10. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blocklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` interface:

- `setSubscribeAudioBlacklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeAudioWhitelist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and a allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

**11. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `setAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AgoraAudioScenarioDefault` to `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannelByToken` in v3.7.x through the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannelByToken` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `switchChannelByToken` method.

**2. Voice pitch of the local user**
This release adds `voicePitch` in `AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo` of `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.
