To implement composite recording mode in your C++ app, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the recorder with `enable_mix` set to `true`.
2. Subscribe to the audio and video streams of the users you want to record.
3. Join the channel with `joinChannel()`.
4. After joining the channel, configure the recording:
   - Use `setRecorderConfig()` to set video resolution, bitrate, and storage path.
   - Optionally, apply watermarks with `enableAndUpdateVideoWatermarks()`.
   - Define the video layout with `setVideoMixingLayout()`.
5. Start and stop recording by calling:
   - `startRecording()`
   - `stopRecording()`

Refer to the following code to implement these steps:

```cpp
// Initialize the recorder in composite recording mode
recorder->initialize(service, true);

// Subscribe to all audio and video streams
recorder->subscribeAllAudio();
recorder->subscribeAllVideo();

// Join the channel
recorder->joinChannel(config.token.c_str(), config.ChannelName.c_str(), config.UserId.c_str());

// Set recording configuration
recorder->setRecorderConfig(recorder_config);

// Apply watermarks (optional)
recorder->enableAndUpdateVideoWatermarks(watermarks, config.waterMarks.size());

// Set the video mixing layout
recorder->setVideoMixingLayout(layout);

// Start recording
recorder->startRecording();

// ...

// Stop recording
recorder->stopRecording();
```
