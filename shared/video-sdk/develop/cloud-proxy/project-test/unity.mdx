        - When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
    Click **Join** to start a call. Now, you can see yourself on the device screen and talk to the remote user using your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
    </ProductWrapper>
