To validate the peer-to-peer messaging you have just integrated into your app using Chat:

1. In the app's configuration, set the `userId`, `appKey`, `agoraToken` to valid values.

1. Click **SIGN IN** and you will see a log that says "sign in success".

1. Run the app on another device or simulator. Ensure that the `userId` values are unique.

1. On the first device or simulator, enter the user id you just created and click **START CHAT**. You can now start chatting between the two clients.
