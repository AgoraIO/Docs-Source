Playing media files during online business presentations, educational sessions, or casual meetups heightens user engagement. <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to add media playing functionality to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. 

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, windows, react-native, electron, unity">

This page shows you how to use media player-related APIs to play local or online media resources with remote users in <Vpd k="NAME" /> channels.

 ## Understand the tech

To play a media file in a channel, you open the file using a media player instance. When the file is ready to be played, you set up the local video container to display the media player output. You update channel media options to start publishing the media player stream, and stop publishing the camera and microphone streams. The remote user sees the camera and microphone streams of the media publishing user replaced by media streams.
