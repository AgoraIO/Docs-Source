#### Delete plugins when integrating using CocoaPods

When integrating the iOS or macOS SDK through CocoaPods, use the `subspecs` field in the Podfile to specify the dynamic libraries you need to integrate. This excludes plug-ins you do not need. For details about the corresponding relationship between dynamic libraries and `subspecs` field, see [subspecs field](#subspecs-field).

Refer to the following samples to use all, none, or some plugins:

* Use all plugins

    ```shell
    # platform :ios, '9.0'
    target 'Your App' do
        pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1'
    end
    ```

* Don't use any plugin

    ```shell
    # platform :ios, '9.0'
    target 'Your App' do
        pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic']
    end
    ```

* Use some plugins

    ```shell
    # platform :ios, '9.0'
    target 'Your App' do
        pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.1', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic', 'AINS', 'AudioBeauty']
    end
    ```

<Admonition type="caution" label="information">When using the above pod command, make sure that the specified version of the SDK has the plug-in you specified, and that the plug-in's `subspecs` field is correct, otherwise during `pod install`, an error is reported. For example, using `pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', '4.0.0', :subspecs => ['RtcBasic', 'AgoraRtcAINS']` , `pod install` will report an error.</Admonition>
