In <Vg k="SIG" />, a channel is an efficient data transfer management mechanism for communicating data from one device to another. A user who subscribes to or joins a channel receives messages or events transmitted in that channel within 100 milliseconds. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> enables a client to subscribe to or join multiple channels at the same time. Most <Vpd k="SDK" /> APIs, such as those for sending and receiving messages, and encryption, use channels as parameters.

## Channel types

Conceptually, a channel is a conduit that controls the flow of messages. <Vg k="SIG" /> provides the following channel types:

<ChannelTypes/>

## Create a channel

<CreateChannel/>

## Channel usage restrictions

<Vg k="SIG" /> puts no limits on the number of message and stream channels that may exist at the same time. However, different types of channels have different restrictions on the number of channels a single client may subscribe to or join concurrently, and the QPS for sending and receiving messages. For details, see [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations).

## Channel naming

A channel name cannot be empty. It must be a string of up to 64 bytes in length, consisting of letters or numbers from the ASCII character set. <Vg k="SIG" /> uses the app ID as the namespace for the channel. Each channel under the app ID is jointly identified by the channel name and the channel type. If two channels have different channel types or different channel names, <Vg k="SIG" /> treats them as two separate channels. If two channels have the same channel type and channel name, <Vg k="SIG" /> treats them as the same channel.

### Legal characters

The supported legal characters are:

- 26 lowercase English letters a-z
- 26 uppercase English letters A-Z
- 10 numbers 0~9
- Space
- `!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `(`, `)`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`, `` ` ``

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">Channel names cannot be prefixed with an underscore. </Admonition>

### Illegal characters

The use of `.`, `*`, `/`, `\`, `\0` and non-printable ASCII characters in channel names is not allowed.

### Naming convention

Although not mandated by the SDK, best practice when naming your channels is to use meaningful prefix characters to indicate the purpose of the channel or the type of messages in the channel so that you present your business logic more clearly. For details, see [Channel naming recommendations](../best-practices/channel-naming).
