### Handle the system logic

1.  **Download the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> tools Git repository**

    To call the token generation methods, you need to add <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token generation code to your project. Clone the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> IO tools repository](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools) to your development device using the following command:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools <your download directory>
    ```

2.  **Add the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> IO tools code to your project**

    Copy the `DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey/python3/src` folder from the repository into the `src` folder of your Python project.

    ``` bash
    cp "<your download directory>/DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey/python3/src/*" "<your project folder>/src"
    ```

3.  **Import the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token builder classes into your project**

    Add the following `import` statements at the beginning of the Python source file where you wish to generate the authentication token:

    ``` python
    from src.RtcTokenBuilder2 import RtcTokenBuilder, Role_Publisher, time
    ```

### Implement token generation

<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses integer user Ids for token generation. To ensure smooth communication, all the users in a channel must use the same type of Id, that is, the integer `uid`. You generate a token using `buildTokenWithUid` for an <Vg k="VSDK" /> token based on `uid`

To generate tokens based on user ID, add the following after the import statements of the Python source file where you wish to generate the authentication token:

``` python
appId = "Your app Id"
appCertificate = "Your app certificate"
channelName = "Your channel name"
uid = 0  # The integer uid, required for an <Vg k="VSDK" /> token
expirationTimeInSeconds = 3600  # The time after which the token expires


def generate_token():
    #  Calculate the time expiry timestamp
    current_timestamp = int(time.time())
    expired_ts = current_timestamp + expirationTimeInSeconds

    print("UID token:")
    token = RtcTokenBuilder.build_token_with_uid(appId, appCertificate, channelName, uid, Role_Publisher, token_expire=expired_ts, privilege_expire=expired_ts)
    print(token)

generate_token()
```
