    - Set up [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) on your development device. Ensure `OpenSSL`  v3.0.0 or above is installed:

            * Execute `openssl version` to check that the version number is `3.0.0` or above. If the version number is lower, remove `openssl` by executing the command:

            ```bash
            sudo apt remove openssl
            ```

            * To install the latest version of `openssl`, execute the following command:

            ```bash
            sudo apt install openssl
            ```
