### Create a project

Follow these steps to create a project in Xcode:

1. Refer to [Create a project](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev07db0e578) to create a new project. Under **Application** select **App**. Choose **Storyboard** for the user interface and use **Swift** as the programming language.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Information">If you have not added development team information, you see the **Add account...** button.  Click the button and follow the on-screen prompts to log in to your Apple ID. Once the login is complete, click **Next**, and choose your Apple account as the development team.</Admonition>

1. [Set up automatic signing](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev23aab79b4) for your projects.

1. [Set the target devices](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve69552ee5) where your app will be deployed.

1. Add device permissions for the project.

    Open the file in the project navigation bar `info.plist`, edit [the property list](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3f399a2a6), and add the recording and camera permissions required for real-time interaction.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Information"><ul><li>The permissions listed in the following table are optional. However, if you do not add the listed permissions, you will not be able to use the microphone and camera for real-time audio and video interaction</li><li>If you need to add a third-party plug-in or library, such as a third-party camera, to your project, and the signature of the plug-in or library is inconsistent with the signature of the project, you need to check the **Hardened Runtime** settings. Specifically, you should review and potentially disable **Runtime Exceptions** and **Library Validation** in the project configuration.</li><li>For further information, refer to [Preparing Your App for Distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing_your_app_for_distribution).</li></ul></Admonition>

    | Key | Type | Value |
    |:----|:-----|:------|
    | Privacy - Microphone Usage Description | String | For the purpose of using the microphone. For example, for a call or live interactive streaming session. |
    | Privacy - Camera Usage Description | String | For the purpose of using the camera. For example, for a call or live interactive streaming session. |

### Integrate the SDK

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="tab1" label="CocoaPods" default>
    1. Go to the project root directory in the terminal and run the  `pod init` command. A text file will be generated in the project folder `Podfile`.

    1. Open the `Podfile` file and modify the content as follows. Replace `Your App` with your target name.

        ```shell
        platform :ios, '9.0'
        target 'Your App' do
          # For x.y.z fill in the specific SDK version number, such as 4.3.0.
          # The latest version number can be obtained from the release notes.
          pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', 'x.y.z'
        end
        ```
    
    1. Run the command `pod install` in the terminal to install the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> SDK. After successful installation, the Terminal shows `Pod installation complete!`.

    1. After successful installation, a file with the suffix `.xcworkspace` is generated in the project folder. Open the file through Xcode for subsequent operations.

  <TabItem value="tab2" label="Manual integration">
    1. Visit the [SDKs download](../../sdks) page, download the latest version of the SDK, and extract the contents.

    1. Copy the files in the `libs` folder of the SDK package to your project directory.

    1. Open Xcode and [add the corresponding dynamic library](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev51a648b07). Make sure the **Embed** property of the added dynamic library is set to **Embed & Sign**.

        <Admonition type="info" title="Information">Agora SDK uses `libc++` (LLVM) by default. If you need to use `libstdc++` (GNU), please contact support@agora.io. The library provided by the SDK is a FAT Image, which includes 32/64-bit simulator and 32/64-bit real machine versions.</Admonition>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab3" label="Swift Package Manager">    
    1. In Xcode, go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependencies...** and paste the following URL:

        <code>https://github.com/AgoraIO/AgoraRtcEngine_iOS.git</code>

    1. Specify the SDK version you want to integrate in **Package Options**. For further information, refer to [Apple's official documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devb83d64851).

### Create a user interface

Based on the usage scenario, create a user interface for your project, including a local video window and a remote video window. Replace the contents of the file `ViewController.swift` with the following code:

<details>
<summary>Sample code to create the user interface</summary>

```swift
import UIKit
import AgoraRtcKit

class ViewController: UIViewController{
    // Define a localView variable
    var localView: UIView!
    // Define ra emoteView variable
    var remoteView: UIView!
    // Define agoraKit
    var agoraKit: AgoraRtcEngineKit!

    //Set the video window layout
    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews(){
        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()
        remoteView.frame = self.view.bounds
        localView.frame = CGRect(x: self.view.bounds.width - 135, y: 30, width: 135, height: 240)
    }

    func initView(){
        // Initialize the remote video window
        remoteView = UIView()
        self.view.addSubview(remoteView)
        // Initialize the local video window
        localView = UIView()
        self.view.addSubview(localView)
    }
}
```
