  Test agent pipelines and troubleshoot configuration issues before deployment.

The <Vpd k="STUDIO" /> test interface allows you to test your configured pipeline and confirm that ASR, LLM, and TTS are functioning together as expected. Use the test panel to refine your system prompts, greeting messages, and provider settings before deployment.

## Test your pipeline

To test your pipeline:

1. Click the **Test Agent** button at the bottom of the pipeline editor to open the test panel.

1. Click the blue phone icon to connect to your agent.
1. After connecting, the agent interface shows "Ambient" status with audio controls.

1. Click the blue microphone icon. The agent status changes from "Joining" to "Connecting Agent" and then to "Listening", indicating the agent is ready to hear you.
1. Speak to your agent and confirm it responds correctly and maintains a conversation without errors.
1. Click the transcript icon to view a live transcript of the conversation.

## What to test

During testing, verify the following:

- **ASR accuracy**:  Speak clearly and check if the agent correctly understands your speech. Review the transcript to verify transcription accuracy. If the agent frequently misunderstands you, consider adjusting ASR parameters or trying a different ASR provider.

- **LLM responses**: Confirm that the agent responds appropriately to your queries. Use the transcript to review the complete conversation flow. If responses are off-topic or unclear, refine your system prompts in the LLM configuration.

- **TTS quality**: Listen to the agent's voice output. If the voice sounds unnatural or has pronunciation issues, adjust TTS settings or select a different voice model.

- **Conversation flow**: Test multi-turn conversations to ensure the agent maintains context and handles follow-up questions correctly.

## Troubleshooting and debugging

If you encounter connectivity or quality issues, refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

### Agent doesn't respond

If the agent doesn't respond after you speak:

- Check the conversation transcript by clicking **View Transcript** to see if any errors occurred
- Verify that your microphone is enabled and permissions are granted in your browser
- Check that all three components have valid credentials
- Ensure your API keys are active and have sufficient quota with your providers

### Poor speech recognition

If the agent frequently misunderstands your speech:

- Speak clearly and reduce background noise
- Review the transcript to see exactly what ASR transcribed compared to what you said
- Check ASR language settings match the language you're speaking
- Try adjusting ASR parameters such as model selection or sensitivity
- Consider switching to a different ASR provider

### Out-of-context responses

If the agent provides irrelevant or unexpected responses:

- Review and refine your system prompts in the LLM configuration
- Check that the LLM model selected is appropriate for your use case
- Verify that your greeting message sets proper context for the conversation

### Voice quality issues

If the agent's voice sounds distorted or unnatural:

- Check your audio output device
- Try selecting a different voice model in TTS settings
- Adjust TTS parameters such as sample rate 
- Consider switching to a different TTS provider

### Connection failures

If you cannot connect to the agent:

- Ensure that the selected Agora project has Conversational AI enabled
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page and try again
- If the issue persists, verify that all provider API keys are valid
