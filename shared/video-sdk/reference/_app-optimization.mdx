## Manual installation

## Reduce the app size

To reduce the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size, implement one or more of the following strategies:

### Use the audio SDK
<Vg k="VSDK" /> supports both audio and video functions, and the package size is large. If you only need to use the audio features, best practice is to integrate the audio SDK. For details, see Voice [SDK download](../../sdks).

### Remove unneeded plugins
The SDK provides an optional plug-in dynamic library. The name of the plug-in is suffixed with `extension`. See the plug-in list for details on the function and size of the plug- in . You can refer to the following ways not to integrate these plug-ins to reduce the size of the app.

#### Remove plugins when manually integrating
When integrating through the official SDK download link, delete the plug-in files you don't need.
