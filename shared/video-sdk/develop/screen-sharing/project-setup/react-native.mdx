### iOS platform

Since Apple does not support capturing the screen in the main process of the app, you create a separate extension for the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream. You use the iOS native `ReplayKit` framework in the extension to record the screen, and then send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream to the main process.
