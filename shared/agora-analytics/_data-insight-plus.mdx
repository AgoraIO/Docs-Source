    Data Insights Plus supports four analysis methods : time series analysis , dimensional analysis , sampling analysis , and comparative analysis , which will be introduced one by one below.

>> The data provided on the Data Insights page is for analysis purposes only, and is not used as the basis for actual billing.

## Analyze data usage

Data Insights Plus supports the following analysis methods: 

### Time series analysis

Above the analysis area on the Data Insights page is the time series analysis area , which shows the time series changes of indicators under the selected conditions.

Timing analysis includes the following functions:

* **Linkage with global filter conditions**: The data displayed in the timing analysis chart will be generated according to the conditions set in the global filter.

* **Line chart interaction**
    * Hover the mouse over a data point: display the indicator-dimension group name, timestamp and indicator value.
    * click data point
        * View hour-level data: Use this point as the data range granularity to switch to one hour.
        * Dimensional decomposition: Start the dimensional analysis with this data point.
        * Data sampling: start sampling analysis with this data point. Currently, only the audio freeze rate, video freeze rate, and network transmission delay rate support data sampling.

* **Auxiliary reference indicators**: indicator selection quality experience indicators (success rate of joining channels, audio/video freeze rate, network delay rate) will additionally display auxiliary reference indicators below the sequence diagram to assist in judging the validity of the data. Hovering the mouse over the auxiliary indicator column chart will display the timestamp, indicator/dimension group name, and indicator value at that point in time.

### Dimensional analysis

Below the analysis area on the data insight page is the dimension analysis area , which shows the distribution of selected indicators under each dimension.

Dimensional analysis includes the following capabilities:

* **Dimension Time Picker**: The dimension analysis area has an independent time selector, and its optional time range is the time interval selected in the time series analysis area, and the time granularity remains the same, that is, a data point in the time series analysis area.
    When the time interval of the time series analysis chart is selected, the dimensional analysis will display the dimensional analysis result of the last data point in the time interval by default.
    You can manually adjust the time in the dimension time selector; you can also click a data point in the time series analysis diagram, and then select **Dimension Decomposition** to view the dimensional analysis results of this point.

* **Quick distribution**: After selecting the main analysis indicator, the dimension analysis area will display several commonly used dimension distribution graphs of the indicator by default. The dimensions supported by each indicator are different, and the display methods of each dimension are also different. You can explore by yourself.

* **Single-dimensional analysis**: In addition to the quick distribution, the analysis dimensions supported by the selected indicator are displayed on the left side of the dimension analysis area. After clicking any dimension, the right side will display the analysis result list of this dimension.

* **Linkage with global filter conditions**: The charts in the quick distribution of dimensional analysis and the results of single-dimensional analysis will be generated according to the filter conditions set in the global filter.

### Sampling analysis

Sampling analysis is only supported when video/audio freeze rate and network transmission delay rate are selected as the main analysis indicator. Click any data point in the time series analysis diagram of these three indicators, and select "Data Sampling" to sample and analyze the data point.

Sampling analysis includes the following functions:

* **Drag the slider to sample**: The orange sampling slider covers a time interval of 30 minutes. After dragging the orange slider to any position on the graph, the indicator changes and gradient distribution during the 30 minutes will be displayed below.

* **Stacked column chart**: The slider sampling result will display the indicator distribution of the 30 minutes in the form of a stacked column chart. Click the color block in the column to perform user sampling for this group.

* **User sampling**
    * After clicking the color column, the relevant information of this group of users will be displayed in a list below, including user ID, device type, network type, etc. Up to 500 sets of data can be displayed.
* Click **Detailed Information** on the right to jump to the "Call Survey-Call Details" page of the corresponding call.
* Clicking on a header item will sort all results in ascending or descending order based on that item.

### Comparative analysis

Comparative analysis supports three methods: indicator comparison , time comparison and global comparison . You can find the comparative analysis button in the upper right corner of the analysis area, click and select the desired analysis method to start the comparative analysis.

#### Index comparison
Indicator comparison is used to compare the changing trends of different indicators in the same time period.

Note when using:

* Support to select up to 3 indicators to compare with the main analysis indicators.
* After selecting multiple indicators and applying them, the dimension global filter conditions will be cleared to initialize the comparison mode, and then the dimension global filter conditions can be added again.
* After selecting and applying multiple indicators, the time series analysis area displays the multi-indicator time series diagram, and the single-dimensional analysis in the dimension analysis area displays the dimensional data corresponding to the multiple indicators.

#### Time comparison
Time comparison is used to compare the data performance and change trend of the same indicator in different time periods.

Note when using:

* The comparison method supports the selection of " comparison with the previous cycle ", " comparison with the previous month " and " custom time ". Take the above picture as an example, the time selector selects "the last 14 days (2023-06-15 to 2023-06-29)", the meanings of the three comparison methods are:

    * Comparison with the previous cycle: compare with the previous 14-day cycle, that is, compare the data from 2023-05-31 to 2023-06-14.
    * Compare with last month: compare with the same period of last month, that is, compare the data from 2023-05-15 to 2023-05-29.
    * Custom time: choose the comparison period by yourself, the granularity is days, and you need to keep the number of days selected consistent with the current time period. In this example, a time period spanning 14 days can be selected for comparison.

* The start time of all comparison time periods must not be earlier than the earliest query time limited by the package.

#### Global comparison

Global comparison is used to compare the results of a certain indicator under dimension conditions with the global results.

When using it, please note that the global comparison will only take effect when the main analysis indicator is selected and the dimension filter condition is added.
