1.	**Integrate the spatial audio plugin** 

    To enable spatial audio functionality, add the Agora spatial audio extension to your project.
    
    1.	Run the following command to install the spatial audio plugin:

        ```bash
        npm install agora-extension-spatial-audio
        ```

    1.	Add the following code to your  `.js` file to import the spatial audio module:

        ```javascript
        import {SpatialAudioExtension} from agora-extension-spatial-audio;
        ```

1.	**Dynamically load Wasm and JS file dependencies** 
    
    The Spatial audio plugin depends on some Wasm and JS files. To ensure that the browser can load and run these files properly, take the following steps:
    
    1.	Publish the Wasm and JS files in the  `node_modules/agora-extension-spatial-audio/external` directory to a CDN or static resource server, and ensure that they are in the same public path. When creating an  `SpatialAudioExtension` object, you pass in the URL of the public path, and the plugin dynamically loads the dependent files.

        * If the Host URL of the Wasm and JS files is inconsistent with the Host URL of the web application, you need to enable the CORS policy for accessing the file domain name.

        * You cannot put Wasm and JS files under HTTP service because loading HTTP resources under HTTPS domain name is prohibited by browser security policy.

    1.	If Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled, Chrome and Edge prohibit loading and running Wasm files by default. You need to configure CSP according to the browser version:

        * Versions greater than or equal to Chrome 97 and Edge 97: Add `script-src` in options `wasm-unsafe-eval`. For example:
        
        ```html
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'">
        ```

        * Versions lower than Chrome 97 and Edge 97: Add script-src in options 'unsafe-eval'.

1. **Register the spatial audio effect plugin**

    Call the `AgoraRTC.registerExtensions` method and pass in the created  `SpatialAudioExtension` instance.

    ```javascript
    const extension = new SpatialAudioExtension({
        assetsPath: yourDeployPath, // for example, yourDeployPath = './resources/external/'
    });

    AgoraRTC.registerExtensions([extension]);
    ```
