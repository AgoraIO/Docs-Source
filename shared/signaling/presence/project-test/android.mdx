2. **Configure the project**:

    In `<samples-root>/signaling-manager/src/main/res/raw/config.json`:

    1. Replace the value for `token` with the <Vg k="SIG" /> token.
    1. Replace the value for `appId` with the value from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.
    1. Replace the value for UID with the the same value you used to generate the token.
    1. Ensure that the `channelName` is filled in. The channel name can be any string.

1.  **Run the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**:

    1. In Android Studio, connect a physical Android device to your development machine.
    1. Click Run to start the app.
    1. A moment later you see the project installed on your device. 
    1. From the main screen of the app, select **SDK Quickstart**.    Use the URL displayed in Terminal to open the app in your browser.

1. **Test presence functionality**:

    1. Run the **Token authentication** example on multiple devices.
    1. Log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> from each device using a different user ID. 
    1. Subscribe to the same channel from all the tabs.
        You see a list of all users in the channel in the **SDK quickstart** tab.
    1. Unsubscribe from the channel in another tab.
        You see that the corresponding user ID disappears from the user list.
