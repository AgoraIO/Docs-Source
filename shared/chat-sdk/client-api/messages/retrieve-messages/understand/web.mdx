The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. Followings are the core methods:

- `getConversationList`: Retrieves a list of conversations stored on the server.
- `getHistoryMessages`: Retrieves the historical messages in the specified conversation from the server.
- `removeHistoryMessages`: Deletes historical messages from the server unidirectionally.
- `deleteConversation`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.
