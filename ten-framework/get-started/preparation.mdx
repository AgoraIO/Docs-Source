  How to develop applications with the TEN framework .
---

This guide explains how to set up your development environment for the TEN framework. The TEN framework supports Windows, Linux, and Mac, with Linux or Mac recommended.

### Linux setup

For Ubuntu, install the following packages:

- `gcc` - C/C++ compiler supported by TEN
- `clang` - Alternative C/C++ compiler
- `clang-format` - Code formatting tool used during runtime
- `clang-tidy` - Static code analyzer
- `cmake` - Build system (version 3.13+)
- `Python3` - Required for Python binding
- `pytest` - Used for integration testing

### Mac setup

Required components:
- XCode
- CocoaPods
- Personal Account

Install dependencies:

```shell
brew install llvm googletest doxygen ninja clang-format
brew install include-what-you-use
```

If the brew-installed cmake is outdated, install from the official website and create a symbolic link:

```shell
ln -s /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
```

If cmake can't find clang-tidy, use:

```shell
ln -sf /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang-tidy /usr/local/bin/clang-tidy
```

For language bindings, install:

```shell
brew install python golang
```

### Windows setup

Install these components:
- Visual Studio Community (up to 2022)
  - Select clang-related tools
  - Add clang binary path to the PATH environment variable
- cmake
- python

When installing cmake and python, avoid paths containing spaces.
</Admonition>

## Build system setup

### ten_gn

TEN uses `ten_gn` as its build system (based on Google GN). The source code is in the `core/ten_gn` directory of the TEN framework repository. Add this directory to your system PATH.

### Docker containers

For a pre-configured build environment, we provide Docker files.

#### Ubuntu 22.04

Navigate to `tools/docker_for_building/ubuntu/22.04` and run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run ten-building-ubuntu-2204
```
