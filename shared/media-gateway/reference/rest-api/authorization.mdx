- HTTP Basic Authentication

    Every time you send an HTTP request, you must pass in a credential in the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [RESTful Authentication](../../../restful-authentication#implement-basic-http-authentication) on how to generate it.

    Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. To use it, send your HTTP requests with an `Authorization` header that contains the word Basic followed by a space and a base64-encoded string `username:password`.

    Example: `Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==`

- HTTP HMAC Authentication

    Every time you send an HTTP request, you must pass in an API key in the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [RESTful Authentication](../../../restful-authentication) on how to generate it.

    Example: `Authorization: 123`
