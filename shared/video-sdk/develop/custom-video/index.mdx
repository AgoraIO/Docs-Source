Custom video capture refers to the collection of a video stream from a custom source. Unlike the default video capture method, custom video capture enables you to control the capture source, and precisely adjust video attributes. You can dynamically adjust parameters such as video quality, resolution, and frame rate to adapt to various application use-cases. For example, you can capture video from high-definition cameras, and drone cameras.

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends default video capture for its stability, reliability, and ease of integration. Custom video capture offers flexibility and customization for specific video capture use-cases where default video capture does not fulfill your requirements.

## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
<Vg k= "VSDK"/> provides support for creating local video tracks by passing in a [MediaStreamTrack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) object to `createCustomVideoTrack`.
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">

<Vpd k="SDK" /> provides a custom video track method for video self-collection. You can create and publish custom video tracks to one or more channels. You use the self-capture module to drive the capture device, and send the captured video frames to the SDK through the video track.

The following figure illustrates the video data transmission process when custom video capture is implemented:

### Applicable use-cases

Use custom video capture in the following industries and use-cases:

**Specialized video processing and enhancement**

In specific gaming or virtual reality use-cases, real-time effects processing, filter handling, or other enhancement effects necessitate direct access to the original video stream. Custom video capture facilitates this, enabling seamless real-time processing and enhances the overall gaming or virtual reality experience for a more realistic outcome.

**High-precision video capture**

In video surveillance applications, detailed observation and analysis of scene details is necessary. Custom video capture enables higher image quality and finer control over capture to meet the requirements of video monitoring.

**Capture from specific video sources**

Industries such as IoT and live streaming often require the use of specific cameras, monitoring devices, or non-camera video sources, such as video capture cards or screen recording data. In such situations, default <Vg k= "VSDK"/> capture may not meet your requirements, necessitating use of custom video capture.

**Seamless integration with specific devices or third-party applications**

In smart home or IoT applications, transmitting video from devices to users' smartphones or computers for monitoring and control may require the use of specific devices or applications for video capture. Custom video capture facilitates seamless integration of specific devices or applications with the <Vg k="VSDK"/>.

**Specific video encoding formats**

In certain live streaming use-cases, specific video encoding formats may be needed to meet business requirements. In such cases, <Vg k="VSDK"/> default capture might not suffice, and custom video capture is required to capture and encode videos in specific formats.

### Advantages

Using custom video capture offers the following advantages:

**More types of video streams**

Custom video capture allows the use of higher quality and a greater variety of capture devices and cameras, resulting in clearer and smoother video streams. This enhances the user viewing experience and makes the product more competitive.

**More flexible video effects**

Custom video capture enables you to implement richer and more personalized video effects and filters, enhancing the user experience. You can implement effects such as beautification filters and dynamic stickers.

**Adaptation to diverse use-case requirements**

Custom video capture helps applications better adapt to the requirements of various use-cases, such as live streaming, video conferencing, and online education. You can customize different video capture solutions based on the use-case requirements to provide a more robust application.
