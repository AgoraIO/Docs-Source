Compelling content like animated presentations with embedded media helps actively engage students for longer in online classrooms. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="FC" /> helps you personalize distance learning using interactive video, shared whiteboards and other collaboration tools. With <Vg k="FC" />, you can quickly deploy effective online tutoring software that is customized with the features and branding your organization needs.

This page shows you how to quickly set up and launch a <Vg k="FC" />.

## Understand the tech

This section explains the workflow you implement to join a <Vg k="FC" />.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1623309158910)

When an app client requests to join a <Vg k="FC" />, the app client and your app server interact with the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server in the following steps:

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server for a <Vg k="SIG" /> token.
2. Your app server generates a <Vg k="SIG" /> token using the Agora [App ID](/flexible-classroom/get-started/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](/flexible-classroom/get-started/manage-agora-account/#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. For details, see [Generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> Token]( /flexible-classroom/develop/authentication-workflow/).
3. Your app client calls an API with the following parameters to join a <Vg k="FC" />:
    - *The user ID*: A unique string identifying a user, generated by your security system. This ID must be the same as the user ID you use for generating the <Vg k="SIG" /> token.
    - *The room ID*: A string for identifying a classroom. When the first user joins a <Vg k="FC" />, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
    - *The <Vg k="SIG" /> token*: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when they join a <Vg k="FC" />.

## Prerequisites
