To ensure reliability of <Vg k="MPULL" />, follow the advice on this page when integrating <Vg k="MPULL" /> RESTful APIs.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to start using <Vg k="MPULL" /> RESTful API:

- The scene of the channel is live, profile set to `BROADCASTING`
- <Vg k="MPULL" /> is enabled
- Message Notification Service is enabled to monitor <Vg k="MPULL" /> events

## Limitations

You are limited in the number of queries per second and concurrent tasks for <Vg k="MPULL" />

### QPS

The following table shows the limits the number of queries per second (QPS) to the <Vg k="MPULL" /> RESTful API.

|API      |QPS limit            |
|:--------|:---------------------|
|Create|<ul><li>Creating cloud players with names is limited to 2 queries per second. </li><li>Creating cloud players without names is limited to 50 queries per second.</li></ul>|
|Delete|Deleting cloud players is limited to 100 queries per second.|
|List|<ul><li>For a project with filter, the limit of the query rate is 2 times per second and 15 times per minute.</li><li>When there is no filter, the limit of query rate is 10 times per second and 20 times per minute.</li></ul>|

When the QPS is exceeded, the status code `429` (Too Many Requests) is returned. If you need a higher QPS limit, contact technical support.

### Maximum number of concurrent tasks

The default maximum number of concurrent tasks is 50, which indicates that a maximum of 50 <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks can be run simultaneously in one project.
If a higher quota is required, contact technical support.

## Ensure the high availability of REST services

To ensure the high availability of REST services and prevent downtime caused by regional network faults, Agora provides
failover and domain name switch.

### Failover

Network failures and risks may be caused by cloud and network software, infrastructure, and other factors that Agora cannot control.
To provide the best possible user experience, <Vg k="MPULL" /> provides high availability automatic task migration for failure recovery.
After a failure is confirmed, the <Vg k="MPULL" /> task is migrated within 240 seconds. During this period, the task may be interrupted.

If you cannot accept the impact of high availability migration based on your own business characteristics, adopt higher quality assurance measures. For example, create multiple <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks for critical
scenes. Alternatively, you can make periodic API calls and monitor notifications to get the latest
task status, then create a new task with a different UID once you confirm the task status is unhealthy.

### Multiple <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks

If you need a more reliable solution than fault recovery, use multiple <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks.

Start a master <Vg k="MPULL" /> task and multiple backup tasks at the same time, then publish their streams into the same channel.
In your app, subscribe audience members to the master stream and listen to the following callback events:

  - `onUserOffline` - The callback saying that the anchor is offline
  - `onRemoteAudioStateChanged/onRemoteVideoStateChanged` - The host audio and callback state has changed

When you receive these notification, notify the apps where users are subscribed to the channel as audience members so that they switch to a backup stream.

When you create multiple <Vg k="MPULL" /> tasks, you are charged separately for each of them. For details, see [Media Pull pricing](../reference/pricing).

## Create cloud player

When creating a cloud player with a `create` API call, pay attention to the following:

- Create the cloud player by the region parameter:
    - The region you set must be in the same area as your media streaming location. For example, if the media stream source is located in
the US, set region to `na`.
    - Pass the region value in lowercase.
- Agora recommends that you assign a string value to the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header. The Agora server returns an
`X-Custom-request-ID` field in the response header for troubleshooting purposes.
- Choose to set UID or account as the user name of the cloud player. Do not set these two fields at the same time. Ensure that each
cloud player has a unique user name within the channel.
- To avoid repeated media streaming due to repeated creation of multiple cloud players, use the `name` field to manage cloud players
under a specific project. Cloud players with the same names cannot exist in the same project. If you attempt to create a cloud player with
a name that already exists, you receive the `409` (Conflict) status code.
- Note the supported audio and video formats and protocols of the cloud player to avoid media streaming failures caused by
unsupported audio and video formats and protocols.
- Set an appropriate value for `idleTimeout`. The default value of 300 seconds is recommended. It means that the cloud player
automatically destroys the media stream after 300 seconds.
- After listening for a cloud player creation success event, when you successfully create a cloud player,
the message notification server notifies your server of the event. The status field in the payload of the event is
`connecting`, indicating that the server is connecting to a media stream address or probing audio and video data.

## Query cloud player

Agora recommends that you paginate all cloud player lists under a project as follows:
- The query parameter `pageToken` is not used when `List` is invoked for the first time.
The page query result and `nextPageToken` returned by the Agora server are obtained in the response message.
- When calling `List` again, pass the `nextPageToken` value into the query parameter `pageToken` to query the cloud player
list of the next page.
3. Until `nextPageToken` is `0`, it means that all cloud players under a project have been found.
Cloud players are listed in ascending order by creation time (`createTs`).

## Troubleshooting and recommended measures

### Retry with retreat strategy

If you receive `404`, `429`, or `5xx` error codes, take an escape strategy. For example, wait 5-6 seconds, 10-11 seconds,
or 15-16 seconds and try again. 
If you get three consecutive `404` or `5xx` error codes, or if the `state` field in the response to checking the status of a media push task says `failed`, it means that the <Vg k="MPULL" /> task has failed. To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1. Check whether the media stream address is correct and whether the media stream can be played.
2. If the media stream address is correct and can be played, destroy the current cloud player and create a new one.

### Troubleshooting by error code

- If the status code is `200`, the request is successful.
- If the status code is not `200`, the request has failed. See the error message in the response body for clarification.

|Status code               |Possible error message |Possible reason of failure |Measures to take|
|:-------------------------|:------------|:--------------|:-----------|
|`400` Bad Request	       |The 'streamUrl' parameter is incorrectly formatted. The `channelName` parameter is invalid. Fix it in your request and retry.|Wrong parameters|Check by referring to the `reason` field in the HTTP response body.|
|`401` Unauthorized	       |Invalid authentication credentials.	|RESTful API authentication failed. |See [RESTful Authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).|
|`403` Forbidden	       |Cloud player is not enabled for this project. Contact us to enable it. This project's permission to use cloud player was revoked. Contact us for details.|The service is not enabled. |Enable the service.|
|`404` Not Found	       |Resource is not found or destroyed.	|The task was not started or is in the process of failover or deletion. |Retry following the retreat strategy.|
|`409` Conflict	           |Resource with the same name already exists.	|Resource with the same name already exists.|Delete the existing cloud player and create it again.|
|`429` Too Many Requests   |Request rate limit exceeded. Resource quota exceeded. No available resources.| Too many requests.	| Retry following the retreat strategy.|
|`500` Unknown	           |Some internal error happened. Contact us to help fix it.	| Internal error.	| Retry following the retreat strategy.|
|`502` Bad gateway	       |Internal errors. Contact us for troubleshooting. |	Internal error. |	Retry with retreat strategy.|
|`503` Service Unavailable |Service overload. Retry with the retreat strategy and contact us to help fix it. Service unavailable temporarily. Retry with the retreat strategy.	|Internal error	|Retry following the retreat strategy.|
|`504` Gateway Timeout	   |Gateway timeout. Query to check whether the player has been created or to create one instead.	|Internal error.	|Retry following the retreat strategy.|

### Contact Agora technical support

If the error persists, print the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` fields in the response header in the log and contact technical support.
