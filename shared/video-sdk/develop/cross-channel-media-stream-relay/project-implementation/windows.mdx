To implement cross-channel media stream relay in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. Start cross-channel media stream relay

    After joining a channel, call `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` to configure the source and target channel information and start forwarding a media stream. 

	```cpp
	// Configure source channel information
	ChannelMediaInfo *m_srcInfo = new ChannelMediaInfo;
	m_srcInfo->channelName = new char[szChannelId.size() + 1];
	strcpy_s(const_cast<char *>(m_srcInfo->channelName), szChannelId.size() + 1,
			 szChannelId.data());
	// Note: The token for source channel is different from the token used when joining the source channel. 
	// It needs to be regenerated using the source channel name and uid = 0
	m_srcInfo->token = APP_TOKEN;
	// It is recommended to set the uid of the source channel to 0, allowing the SDK to assign a random uid.
	m_srcInfo->uid = 0;

	// Configure destination channel information
	int nDestCount = m_vecChannelMedias.size();
	ChannelMediaInfo *lpDestInfos = new ChannelMediaInfo[nDestCount];
	for (int nIndex = 0; nIndex < nDestCount; nIndex++) {
		lpDestInfos[nIndex].channelName = m_vecChannelMedias[nIndex].channelName;
		lpDestInfos[nIndex].token = m_vecChannelMedias[nIndex].token;
		// Set the uid to 0, allowing the SDK to assign a random uid, or specify your own uid
		// Ensure that it is different from all uids in the target channels
		lpDestInfos[nIndex].uid = m_vecChannelMedias[nIndex].uid;
	}

	ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration cmrc;
	cmrc.srcInfo = m_srcInfo;
	cmrc.destInfos = lpDestInfos;
	cmrc.destCount = nDestCount;
	int ret = 0;
	// Start or update the cross-channel media stream relay
	ret = m_rtcEngine->startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay(cmrc);
	```

    * Best practice is to set the UID of the source channel to `0`, allowing the SDK to assign a random UID.
    * The source channel token in `srcChannelInfo` should be different from the one used when joining the source channel. Generate a new token using the source channel name and `uid = 0`.
    * For the destination channel, set the uid to `0`, to allow the SDK to assign a random `uid`, or specify a `uid`, ensuring that it is different from all uids in the target channel.

2. Update media stream relay channels

    To forward the stream to multiple target channels or exit the current forwarding channel after staring channel media relay, call `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` again to add or remove target channels for forwarding.

    <Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
    The updated configuration completely **replaces** the previous configuration.
    </Admonition>

3. Pause or resume media stream relay

    To pause forwarding the media stream to all target channels, call `pauseAllChannelMediaRelay`.

	```cpp
	m_rtcEngine->pauseAllChannelMediaRelay();
	```

	To resume forwarding the media stream to all target channels, call `resumeAllChannelMediaRelay`.
	
	```cpp
	m_rtcEngine->resumeAllChannelMediaRelay();
	```

4. Stop cross-channel media stream relay

    To stop forwarding the media stream, call `stopChannelMediaRelay` . When forwarding stops, the host exits all target channels.

	```cpp
	m_rtcEngine->stopChannelMediaRelay();
	m_lstInfo.AddString(_T("stopChannelMediaRelay"));
	m_btnStartMediaRelay.SetWindowText(CrossChannelStartMediaRelay);
	```
	
	<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
    If this method fails, you can call `leaveChannel` to leave the channel, and cross-channel media stream relay will automatically stop.
    </Admonition>

5. Listen for cross-channel media stream status changes

    During cross-channel media stream relay, the SDK reports changes in the status of media stream relay through the `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged` callback. Implement relevant business logic based on the [status codes](#status-codes).

	```cpp
	class CAgoraCrossChannelEventHandler : public IRtcEngineEventHandler {
		virtual void onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged(
            CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE state, 
            CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_ERROR code) override {
			if (m_hMsgHanlder)
				::PostMessage(m_hMsgHanlder, 
                              WM_MSGID(EID_CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE_CHNAGENED), 
                              state, code);
		}
	};  
	```
