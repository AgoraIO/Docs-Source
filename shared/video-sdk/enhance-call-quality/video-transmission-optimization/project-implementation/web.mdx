When creating a local video track using the `createCameraVideoTrack`, `createScreenVideoTrack`, or `createCustomVideoTrack` methods, you have the option to specify the transmission optimization mode through the `optimizationMode` parameter:

- `"motion"`: Prioritizes smoothness, ensuring a stable video stream even in challenging network conditions.
- `"detail"`: Prioritizes clarity, maintaining a clear video image even if network conditions degrade.

If the `optimizationMode` parameter is not specified, the SDK will apply default optimization modes based on the type of video track:

- For screen sharing video tracks, the default optimization strategy is clarity first, prioritizing a clear image over smoothness.
- For other types of local video tracks, such as camera or custom tracks, the default optimization strategy aims to balance clarity and smoothness. This means that the SDK will adjust the frame rate and resolution under weak network conditions to maintain a satisfactory viewing experience.

During a video call, live broadcast, or screen sharing session, you can dynamically adjust the video transmission mode using the `setOptimizationMode` method. For example, if you switch from presenting slides (requiring clarity) to showing a video (requiring smoothness), you can switch the transmission optimization mode from `detail` to `motion` to ensure that the video remains fluid even in fluctuating network conditions.

```javascript
// Use default strategy
const videoTrack2 = await AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack();
```

```javascript
const videoTrack = await AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack({
  // Use clear priority
  optimizationMode: "detail",
});
```

```javascript
const videoTrack2 = await AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack({
  // Use smoothness priority
  optimizationMode: "motion",
});
```
