**Datadog** is an events and metrics aggregator. It enables the users to visualize and monitor these metrics, setup custom alerts, create dashboards and [more](https://docs.datadoghq.com/). <Vg k="AA" /> supports pushing your usage, quality, and performance data directly to your Datadog account.

## Getting started

1.  Subscribe to a [pricing plan](/agora-analytics/reference/pricing).

2.  Login to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io) and click **<Vpd k="NAME"/>** on the left navigation bar.

3.  In the left panel, click on **Integration > Datadog**.

## Enable Datadog integration

The Datadog Configuration in <Vg k="AA" /> can be used only when the Datadog Integration feature is enabled by the user's Datadog Package.
