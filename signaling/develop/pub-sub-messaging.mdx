For Pub-sub you subscribe to a Message channel to receive messages, but you do not need to join the channel when
publishing messages. RTM allows thousands of Message Channels to exist in your app at the same time, but due to end-side performance and bandwidth limitations, a single client can only subscribe to a limited number of channels at the same time, see API usage restrictions for details .
