The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. The following are the core methods:

- `asyncFetchConversationsFromServer`: Retrieves a list of conversations stored on the server.
- `asyncFetchHistoryMessages`: Retrieves historical messages of a conversation from the server according to `FetchMessageOption`, the parameter configuration class for retrieving historical messages.
- `asyncPinConversation`: Pins conversations.
- `asyncFetchPinnedConversationsFromServer`: Retrieves pinned conversations.
- `asyncPinMessage`: Pins a message in a conversation.
- `asyncUnPinMessage`: Unpin a message in a conversation.
- `asyncGetPinnedMessagesFromServer`: Get a list of pinned messages in a conversation.
- `removeMessagesFromServer`: One-way deletion of historical messages on the server based on message time or message ID.
- `deleteConversationFromServer`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.

The Chat SDK provides the following methods for tagging conversations:

- `asyncAddConversationMark`: Tags a conversation.
- `asyncRemoveConversationMark`: Removes tag of a conversation.
- `asyncGetConversationsFromServerWithCursor`: Queries conversation from the server by the conversation tag.
- Query the local conversations by the conversation tag: Call the `getAllConversations` method to obtain all local conversations and then perform conversation filtering yourself.
- Get all tags of a local conversation: Call `getConversation` to get a local conversation, and then use `marks` of the returned object to view all tags associated with a conversation.
