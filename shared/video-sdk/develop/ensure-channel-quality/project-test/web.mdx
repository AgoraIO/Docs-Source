3. In _main.js_, update `appID`, `channel` and `token` with your values.

4. Start the dev server

      Execute the following command in the terminal:

      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

      Use the Url displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in your browser.

5. When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts, it does the following:

      - Displays the available audio and video devices.

      - Enables the dual-stream mode.

      - Sets the audio profile. 

      - Sets the video profile.

      - Sets fallback option for the remote video.

6. Test the audio and video devices:

      1. Select an audio device from the **Audio Devices** dropdown.

      1. Select a video device from the **Video Devices** dropdown.

      1. Click **Start Audio/Video device test**.

            You see the video from the selected video device is played in the local video container and the audio from the selected audio recording device is played on the playback device.

      1. To stop the test, click **Stop Test**.

8. Grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

      You see the last-mile uplink and downlink network quality indicators updated periodically based on the result of the `network-quality` callback.

9. To start audio mixing, select *Host*, and then click *Start audio mixing*.
      You hear the audio file played over the channel taking advantage of the echo cancellation features of Video SDK.

10. Click *Show Statistics*.

      Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> prints the selected call-quality statistics in the debug console.

11. To test stream fallback strategy, run another instance of the app on a test device and join the same channel.
  The <Vg k="VSDK" /> applies the fallback strategy when any of the instances expirence network degradation.

### Test the audio playback device

Due to browser security limitations, the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="VSDK" /> does not provide any API method for testing the audio playback device. You can test the audio playback device in either of the following ways:

      1. Use the HTML5 `<audio>` element to create an audio player on the web page for users to play an online audio file and confirm whether they can hear the sound.
      2. After creating a microphone audio track, call `MicrophoneAudioTrack.play` to play the audio and check whether they can hear the audio.
