- For a working example, check out the [AI Noise Suppression web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/aiDenoiser/index.html) and the associated [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web/tree/main/Demo/aiDenoiser).

### API reference

#### IAIDenoiserExtension

##### checkCompatibility

```typescript
checkCompatibility(): boolean;
```
**Since v1.1.0**.

Checks whether the AI Noise Suppression extension is supported on the current browser. The returned result is for reference only.

##### createProcessor

```typescript
createProcessor(): IAIDenoiserProcessor;
```

Creates an `IAIDenoiserProcessor` instance.

##### onloaderror

```typescript
onloaderror?: (error: Error) => void;
```

Reports when the Wasm files fail to load.

#### IAIDenoiserProcessor
##### kind

```typescript
get kind(): 'video' | 'audio';
```

The processor type, which is categorized as video or audio.

##### enabled

```typescript
get enabled(): boolean;
```

Whether the extension is enabled:
- true: The extension is enabled.
- false: The extension is disabled.

##### enable

```typescript
enable(): void | Promise<void>;
```

Enables the AI Noise Suppression extension.

##### disable

```typescript
disable(): void | Promise<void>;
```

Disables the AI Noise Suppression extension.

##### setMode

```typescript
setMode(mode: AIDenoiserProcessorMode): Promise<void>;
```

**Since v1.1.0**.

Sets the noise suppression mode.
	
When the resource consumption is high, call this method in the [onoverload](#onoverload) callback to switch to stationary noise suppression. See [AIDenoiserProcessorMode](#aidenoiserprocessormode) for details.

Call this method after <Link to="{{GLOBAL.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/imicrophoneaudiotrack.html#pipe">`pipe`</Link>.

##### setLevel

```typescript
setLevel(level: AIDenoiserProcessorLevel): Promise<void>;
```
**Since v1.1.0**.

Sets the intensity of AI noise suppression. See [AIDenoiserProcessorLevel](#aidenoiserprocessorlevel).

Call this method after <Link to="{{GLOBAL.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/imicrophoneaudiotrack.html#pipe">`pipe`</Link>.

##### dump

```typescript
dump(): void;
```

Dumps audio data in order to help troubleshoot noise reduction issues.

Call this method after <Link to="{{GLOBAL.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/imicrophoneaudiotrack.html#pipe">`pipe`</Link>.

Calling this method triggers the `ondump` callback nine times, returning nine WAV files (see the description below) for the audio data processed by the extension 30 seconds before and 60 seconds after the method call, then triggers the `ondumpend` callback to inform you that the audio data ends dumping.

**Audio file description**

Each audio file is encoded in PCM format and is 30 seconds long. The filename looks like `input_16000hz_1ch_0.pcm`, which contains the following information:

- The stage of the audio data:
   - input: Indicates the audio data is not processed yet.
   - ns_out: Indicates the audio data is processed by the noise reduction algorithm.
   - agc_out: Indicates the audio data is processed by the speech enhancement algorithm.
- The audio sampling rate.
- The number of audio channels.
- The time (T, seconds) when the audio data is dumped. The audio file contains data within the time range [T-30,T].


**Notes**

- If you disable the AI Noise Suppression extension before the `ondump` callback is triggered nine times, the dumping process ends immediately and the `ondumpend` callback is triggered. In this case, fewer than nine audio data files are returned.
- If the actual audio data processed by the extension is less than 30 seconds long, the returned audio file is less than 30 seconds long.

##### ondump

```typescript
ondump?: (blob: Blob, name: string) => void;
```

Reports that audio data is dumped.

This callback has the following parameters:

- `blob`: The audio data file.
- `name`: The `name `of the audio data file.

##### ondumpend

```typescript
ondumpend?: () => void;
```

Reports that audio data ends dumping.

##### onoverload

```typescript
onoverload?: (elapsedTime: number) => void;
```

Reports that the noise reduction process takes too long.

This callback has the following parameters:
- `elapsedTime`: The time (ms) the extension needs to process one audio frame. This value is for reference only, and the time precision depends on the browser. For example, the time precision is relatively low on Firefox.

#### Type definition

##### AIDenoiserExtensionOptions

```typescript
export interface AIDenoiserExtensionOptions {
  assetsPath: string
}
```

Options for initializing the AI Noise Suppression extension:
- `assetsPath`: The host URL of the .wasm files required by the AI Noise Suppression extension.

##### AIDenoiserProcessorMode

```typescript
export enum AIDenoiserProcessorMode {
  NSNG = "NSNG",
  STATIONARY_NS = "STATIONARY_NS",
}
```

The noise suppression mode:

- `NSNG`: AI noise suppression. This mode suppresses stationary and non-stationary noise described in [Noise types](#type).
- `STATIONARY_NS`: Stationary noise suppression. This mode suppresses stationary noise only. Agora recommends that you use this mode only when AI noise suppression takes too long.


##### AIDenoiserProcessorLevel

```typescript
export enum AIDenoiserProcessorLevel {
    SOFT = "SOFT",
    AGGRESSIVE = "AGGRESSIVE",
}
```

The intensity of AI noise suppression:
- `SOFT`: (Recommended) Light level of noise suppression.
- `AGGRESSIVE`: Medium level of noise suppression. At this level, the audio quality of human voices might be considerably affected.
