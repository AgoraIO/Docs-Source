Chat groups are features that enable instant messaging among multiple chat users. The relationship between chat group members is persistent: chat group members can send and receive messages in the group and also receive push notifications when they are offline.

## Chat group types

Groups can be divided into public groups and private groups according to the public accessibility.

| Group type | Join method  | Retrieval of group information       |
| :------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Public group   | Any users can apply to join a group or be invited by the group owner or an admin to join. Whether the join requests need to be approved by the group owner or admins depends on the group setting, for example, `GroupStyle` for Android.  | <ul><li>The specifications of a group and the list of public groups are accessible to the public. </li><li>The group announcement, the list of group shared files, and the group member list are only accessible to users that have joined the group.</li></ul>|
| Private group   | Users can only be invited to join a group. Whether regular group members, besides the group owner and admins, can invite a user to join the group depends on the group setting, for example, `GroupStyle` for Android.| The group specifications, group announcement, the list of group shared files, and the group member list are only accessible to users that have joined the group.  |

The offline push function is not available to group with more than 3000 members. To enable the offline push function for such a large group, contact [support@agoro.io](mailto:support@agoro.io) before creating it. Note that it is impossible to enable the offline push function for a large group that is created. The maximum number of members that a group can contain varies with your price plans. For details, see [Pricing Plan Details](pricing-plan-details).

## Chat group roles and privileges

Chat groups have the following roles and privileges:

- Chat group members: Members can send and receive group messages. They do not have any administrative privileges.
- Chat group admins: Admins are members that also have some administrative privileges, including modifying the group announcements and managing chat group members (but not other admins). Admins are appointed by the chat group owner.
- Chat group owner: The owner is the group member with the most authority. When a user creates a chat group, they automatically become the group owner. Owners have the most privileges in a chat group, including appointing group admins, modifying group announcements, and managing group members (including admins). Owners can also disband the group or transfer ownership to another member.

## Chat groups vs. chat rooms

Chat groups and chat rooms both support instant messaging among multiple users. However, chat groups typically have a more consistent membership then Chat rooms. Chat group users are normally connected to the group itself; chat room users are more likely to be connected by their interest in the subject of the chat room, and so they tend to join and leave more freely.

The specific feature differences are listed in the following table:

| Feature    | Chat group   | Chat room     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where members have a preexisting relationship with each other. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream channel, they leave the chat room.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000+  |
| Message push support | If the offline push function is integrated, members receive push notifications when they go offline. | Members do not receive push notifications when they go offline, as the offline push function is supported in chat rooms. |
| Offline message storage   | This feature is supported. Agora Chat servers store messages sent to offline group members and send to them once they go back online. A maximum number of 200 messages across chat groups can be stored per end user.  | Chat room does not store messages sent to offline chat room members and this feature is not supported in chat rooms. |
| Message history  | Agora Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. You can call [this Client API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/client-api/messages/retrieve-messages?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages-of-the-specified-conversation) to allow the SDK to retrieve message history of a chat group. This allows end users to synchronize messages history across multiple end devices.  | Agora Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. Agora Chat currently does not support SDK retrieving message history of a chat room via client APIs. However, when a user joins a chat room, Agora Chat servers can send 10 most recent messages to the client side via the message receiving callback. To enable this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io). The number of historical messages sent to the new chat room member can be increased up to 200, without additional charges.|
| Message reliability | Each member receives all the messages in the chat group. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the chat room message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |
