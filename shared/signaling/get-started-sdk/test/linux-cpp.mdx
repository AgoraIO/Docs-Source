Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Use the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/) to generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

    1. Select Signaling from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
    1. Fill in your app ID and app certificate from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
    1. Click **Generate Token**.

1. In your code, replace `<Your App ID>` with your app ID from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and `<Your token>` with the generated token. Save the project. Make sure Signaling is activated for your project in <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

3. In the terminal, run the following command to compile the project:

    ```shell
    sh +x clean_build.sh
    ```

4. Use the following commands to navigate to the `build` folder and run the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

    ```shell
    cd build
    ./RTMQuickStart
    ```

    You see menu options to **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**, **publish**, and **logout**.

5. Follow the prompts to **subscribe** to a channel.

1. Run another instance of the app using a different user ID. Follow the prompts to **publish** a message to the same channel that you subscribed to from the other instance.

1. You see the message displayed in the instance that you used to subscribe to the channel.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
