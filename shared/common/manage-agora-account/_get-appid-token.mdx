## Get Started with Agora

To join a real-time enagement session powered by Agora, you need to provide an App ID and temp Token. This page shows you how to get the information.

### Create an Agora account

Sign up [here](https://sso.agora.io/en/signup/) to create an Agora account. After sign-up, you can log in [here](https://console.agora.io/).

For details, see `<sign-in-and-sign-up,Sign up for an Agora account>`.

### Create an Agora project

Once you finish the sign-up process, you can create an Agora project in Agora Console.

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1. In {data.CONSOLE}, open the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. Click *Create*.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check *Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)* as the authentication mechanism.
4. Click *Submit*. You can now see the project on the *Project Management* page.

### Get the App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click ![Image](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532) in the App ID column.

### Get the App Certificate

When generating a token on your app server, you need to fill parameters such as the App ID, channel name, user ID, and App Certificate.

To get an App Certificate, do the following:

1. On the[Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page, click *Config* for the project you want to use

2. Click the copy icon under *Primary Certificate*.

### Generate a Customer ID and Customer Secret

The Agora RESTful API uses a Customer ID and Customer Secret for basic HTTP authorization.

To generate a set of Customer ID and Customer Secret, do the following:

1. In [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), click the account name in the top right corner, and click *RESTful API* from the drop-down list to enter the *RESTful API* page. ![Image](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637661003647)
2. Click *Add a secret*, and click *OK*. A set of Customer ID and Customer Secret is generated.
3. Click *Download* in the *Customer Secret* column. Read the pop-up window carefully, and save the downloaded `key_and_secret.txt` file in a secure location.

### Generate a temporary token

When a user attempts to join a channel, your app passes an encrypted authentication token to {data.AGORA_BACKEND}, this token is unique for each channel. It is generated using the App ID of your project and the channel name. In a test or production environment, your app retrieves the token from a token server. However, for local testing, you can generate a temporary token in {data.CONSOLE}.

1. In {data.CONSOLE}, open [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects), select your project and click *Config*.

2. Under *Features*, click *Generate temp RTC token*.

3. Type the *Channel Name*, then click *Generate*.
  {data.CONSOLE} generates a token valid to join *Channel Name* only.

4. Click *Copy*.
  *Temp Token* is added to the clipboard of your development machine.

### Generate an RTM token

Applicable products of RTM tokens include Real-time Messaging and Flexible Classroom.

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using tokens to authenticate users logging in to an RTM system.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTM tokens. To generate an RTM token:

1. Visit [token builder](https://webdemo.agora.io/token-builder).
2. Fill in the App ID, App certificate, and user ID to log in to the RTM system. You need to specify the user ID yourself (for example, "test"). The generated RTM token is showed on the screen. When calling the `login` method later, ensure that the user ID is the same with the one that you use to generate the RTM token.
