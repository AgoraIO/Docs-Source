This page shows you how to integrate and use the <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> content detection and moderation extension in your
<Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

The development environment requirements are as follows:

<Prerequisites />
- Implemented <Link to="../../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> for <Vg
  k="VIDEO"/></Link> using the 4.1.1-special.8 release.

## Project Setup

In order to configure <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />:

1. **Setup your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account**

    1. In <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/marketplace/list/all">Agora Extensions Marketplace</Link>, select
    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />, then click **Activate Your Account**.

        <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends you an email with activation details.


    1. Open the <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> email and follow the instructions to activate your  <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account.

        During this process, you open <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" /> in your browser.


1. **Configure your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API**

    Keys are used in your webhooks for callback authentication. If you donâ€™t require authentication, you can skip this stage.

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.

        **Account Settings** opens.

    1. Click **Data Management** > **<Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API Keys**, then click **Add Key**.

    1. In **Add API Key**, fill in the form and click **Generate Key**.

    1. Click **Data Management** > **API Management** > **Key Management**, then click **Add Key**.

    1. In **Add API Key**, add your **Key Name** and **Description**, then click **Generate Key**.

    1. Click **Your API Key** and save it to a secure place.

        This key appears only once. You use this key to share data using <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API, test the data flow
  and make sure your data arrives as expected.

1. **Define the information <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends to your webhook**

    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> monitors the data sent in a channel. When content matches conditions in a workflow,
    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends a PUSH request to your webhook with information about the channel, the data sent and
    the user who sent it. To enable this, you configure the data that is sent to your webhook

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.

       **Account Settings** opens.

    1. Click **MODERATION CAPABILITIES** > **Custom Fields**.

    1. Add your custom fields.

<a name="define-webhook"/>
1. **Configure Action webhooks**

    1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click **DATA MANAGEMENT** > **Action Webhooks**, then click **Add Webhook**.

    1. In **Add Action Webhook**, update the following fields and click **Save**.

        - **Action** - The name for this webhook.
        - **Related Entity** - Set to `content`.
        - **Endpoint URL** - The FQDM for your webhook. For example: `https://my.super.duper/webhook`.
        - **Request Method** - Set to POST.
        - **API Key** - For authenticated requests to your webhook. Choose the key you configured earlier. If you
        do not require authentication, set to No auth.


    1. In **Body**, configure the format of the JSON object and data sent to your webhook. Set the following:

        ```json
          {
              "contentUrl":"$contentUrl",
              "status":"$status",
              "userId":"$userId",
              "addedAt":"$addedAt",
              "contentId":"$contentId",
              "reason":"$violationsCategories",
              "metaData": $metaData
              }
          }
        ```


1. **Create an Action**

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.
    1. Click **Moderation Capabilities** > **Action Management**, then click **Add Action**
    1. In **Choose Action Type**, click **Enforce**, then click **Next**
    1. Fill **Action Name**, then **Choose Webhook**.

    Whenever a workflow or a moderator triggers the Action, the webhook is activated.

1. **Configure automated workflows**

    Rule-based workflows in <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" /> are triggered by any data point, and start any Action you created.
  To add a new workflow.

    1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the hamburger menu at the top left, click **Workflows**.

    1. Click **Create New** and follow the UI to set the:

        - Initiator - the subset of data applicable for this workflow. For example, **Abusive** or **Harmful**. In the
  parameter picker on the right side menu, choose a **Violation Type**.
        - Condition - further rules routing data according to different criteria. For example, **Risk Score equals 90**.
        - Action - the result of the workflow for any item that matches its conditions. For example, suspent. This is a system action or a webhook.

        Workflows are only active after you enable them.

1. **Connect your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> to your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account**

    In order for <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> to monitor data streamed to a channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />,   <Vg
    k="RTEE_AF"/>  needs to bind your App ID to your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account. To do this:

    1. Send <Vg k="COMPANY" /> an email at support@agora.io requesting <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> activation with your:
        - Company name
        - Company email
        - Agora APP-ID,
        - The Callback URL for the webhook you [defined in <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> ](#define-webhook)

    1. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> activates communication between your  <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and  <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> and supplies any extra credentials to you.

    1. <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> communicates any extra credentials to you.


1. **Invite users and start moderating with <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />**

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.

    1. Click **Users** > **Account Users**.

    1. Click **Add user** and invite team members who should have access to your account.

    To start moderating on <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" /> and unlock more value for moderation teams, email support@activefence.com or
    send an intercom messenger in <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />.


## Integrate the extension

Now that  <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> can check content sent in the channels in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />,  you need to:

1. **Enable content moderation in your app**

    To ensure that content moderation is active in your app when a user joins a channel, add code such as the
    following to your app:

      ```swift
      extension AgoraManager {
          func setupContentInspect() {
              let inspectConfig = AgoraContentInspectConfig()
              let module = AgoraContentInspectModule()
              module.type = AgoraContentInspectType.imageModeration // Be sure to set type as cloudmoderation
              module.interval = 2 // Set content moderation to run every 2 seconds
              inspectConfig.modules = [module]
              let inspEnabled = engine.enableContentInspect(true, config: inspectConfig)
              print("inspect enabled = \(inspEnabled)")
          }
      }

      struct ContentView: View {
          @ObservedObject var agoraManager = AgoraManager(appId: "Your APP ID", role: .broadcaster)
          var channelId: String = "test"
          var body: some View {
              ScrollView {
                  VStack {
                      ForEach(Array(agoraManager.allUsers), id: \.self) { uid in
                          AgoraVideoCanvasView(manager: agoraManager, uid: uid)
                              .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit).cornerRadius(10)
                      }
                  }.padding(20)
              }.onAppear {
                  agoraManager.joinChannel(channelId, token: nil)
                  agoraManager.setupContentInspect()
                  }
              }.onDisappear {
                  agoraManager.leaveChannel()
              }
          }
      }
      ```

1. **Setup your webhook**

    In order to react to calls made by <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> for moderated content, your need to:

    1. Create a server that received and interprets the data sent to you in the webhook you [defined in <Vg
   k="RTEE_AF" /> ](#define-webhook)

    1. React to the webhook. For example, use the [Channel Management REST API](/en/video-calling/reference/channel-management-rest-api#creates-a-rule) to expel the user from a channel.
