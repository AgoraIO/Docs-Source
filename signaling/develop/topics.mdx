  Implement the Topics functionality in the Stream channel.
---

Topic is a mechanism for data management, transmission, and distribution in the Stream channels. After joining a Stream Channel, users do not have the ability to send and receive messages. You need to implement the message sending and receiving function through Topics first. All subscribers of a Topic receive the data sent by the publisher within 100 milliseconds.

Compared to the Message Channel, the Topic mechanism in the Stream Channel has a higher message transmission rate, greater message concurrency capability, and synchronization capability with audio and video data transmission. Therefore, Topics are widely used in the metaverse, AR/VR, interactive games, real-time collaboration, parallel control, and other scenarios.

### Create topic

A Topic is a dynamic resource that users can use at any time. You do not need to define or create a Topic in advance, the SDK will automatically create it when the first user joins the Topic. You also do not need to specifically destroy a Topic, the SDK will automatically destroy it when the last user leaves.

### Topic restrictions

A single client can have an unlimited number of Topics at the same time, and there is no limit on the number of subscribers and publishers in each Topic. However, in order to balance the client-side bandwidth and performance, there are certain limits on the following:

- The number of Topics that a single client can join at the same time.
- The number of Topics that can be subscribed to at the same time.
- The number of message publishers that can be subscribed to a Topic at the same time.

For details, see [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations).

### Topic naming

A Topic name is a string of letters or numbers in the ASCII character set, up to 16 ASCII characters in length. All Topics under the same Stream channel have unique names.

The following characters in Topic names are supported:

- Lowercase English letters a-z
- Uppercase English letters A-Z
- Numbers 0-9
- Space
- `!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `(`, `)`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`

The following characters are not supported:

- `.`, `*`, `/`, `\`, `\0`
- Non-printable ASCII characters

Although the SDK does not mandate it, Agora recommends that, when naming a Topic, you use meaningful prefix characters to indicate the business purpose of the Topic or the type of messages in it. Topic naming recommendations are the same as channel naming recommendations.
