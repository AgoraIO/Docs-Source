3. In Android Studio, open `app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity`, and update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values for your temporary token.

1. Connect a physical Android device to your development device.

1. In Android Studio, click *Run app*. A moment later you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run the project, grant microphone and camera access to your app.

1. **Test the custom video source**

    Add code to the basic framework presented above, to do the following:

    1. In `onSurfaceTextureAvailable` enable the video source and set its parameters.

    1. In `onSurfaceTextureAvailable` set `SurfaceTexture` of the custom video source to `previewSurfaceTexture`.

    1. In `onFrameAvailable` convert `surfaceTexture` data to a `VideoFrame`.

1. **Test the custom audio source**

    Press **Join**. You hear the audio file streamed to the web demo app. 

    To use this code for streaming data from your particular custom audio source, modify the `readBuffer()` method to read the audio data from your source, instead of a raw audio file.
