### Disable 3A

<Vg k="VSDK" /> turns on 3A by default. In audio processing, 3A stands for Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC), Active Noise Suppression (ANS), and Automatic Gain Control (AGC). Sound card devices usually provide some built-in audio processing, such as echo and noise cancellation. Currently, if 3A is enabled in the application layer, it may cause over-processing of the audio signal and interference between different algorithms may impact sound quality. Best practice is that users with sound cards disable 3A by calling [`createMicrophoneAudioTrack`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/web/4.x/interfaces/iagorartc.html#createmicrophoneaudiotrack).

```javascript
AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack({
  AEC: false,  // Turn off echo cancellation
  AGC: false,  // Turn off gain control
  ANS: false,  // Turn off noise reduction
}).then(/**...**/);
```
