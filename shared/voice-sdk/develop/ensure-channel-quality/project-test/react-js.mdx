1. **Initialization best practice**

    When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> initializes the <Vg k="ENGINE" />, it does the following:

    * Sets the logging level according to your preference.
    * Enables the dual-stream mode.
    * Sets the video profile.
    * Starts a network probe test.
    
    You see the result of the network probe test displayed in the network status icon.
