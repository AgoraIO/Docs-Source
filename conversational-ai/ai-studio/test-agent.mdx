### Test your agent

After configuring ASR, LLM, and TTS components:

1. Review your pipeline configuration to ensure all components are properly configured.
3. Click **Test Agent** to verify your pipeline works as expected. You see a **Ready to connect**

The test interface allows you to interact with your configured pipeline and confirm that ASR, LLM, and TTS are functioning correctly together. Use this opportunity to refine your system prompts, greeting messages, and provider settings before deployment.
