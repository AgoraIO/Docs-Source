For message channel, you do not need to define or create the channel in advance before using it. When you send a message to a message channel or subscribe to a message channel for the first time, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> will automatically create the channel for you.

For stream channel, although it is essentially ready to use, you need to explicitly call the `createStreamChannel` method to create an instance of a `StreamChannel` object before you can call the `join` method to join the channel.
