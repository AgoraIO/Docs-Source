1. Under **Real-time engagement core**, find **Notification Center Service**, and press **Config**.

    ![](\images\notification-center-service\ncs-config.png)

1. In **Notification Center Service Configuration**, fill in the following information, and click **Save**:
    * **Product Name**: \<your product name\>
    * **Event**: Select the channel events that you want to subscribe to.

        If the events that you want to subscribe to have high queries per second (QPS), such as events 105 and 106, ensure your server has sufficient processing capacity.

    * **Receive Server Location**: Select the region where your server that receives the notifications is located. Agora connects to the nearest Agora node server based on your specified location.

    * **Receive Server URL**: The HTTPS address of your server that receives the notifications.

        * To enhance security, the Agora NCSno longer supports HTTP addresses.
        * To reduce the delay in notification delivery, Agora recommends that you activate HTTP persistent connection (also called HTTP keep-alive) on your server with the following settings:

            * `MaxKeepAliveRequests`: 100 or more
            * `KeepAliveTimeout`: 10 seconds or more

    * **Secret**: The secret used for signature verification.For instructions on how to use the secret for signature verification, see Signature verification.
    
    * **Allowed IP List**: If your server is behind a firewall, ensure that you have called the IP address query API to get the IP addresses of the Agora NCS server and added them to the firewall's allowed IP list, and check the box here.

1. Saud, add a step here to copy the signature to your code.

1. Agora performs a health test for your configuration as follows:

    1. The NCS health test generates test events that correspond to your subscribed events, and then sends test event callbacks to your server. In test event callbacks, the channelName is `test_webhook`, and the uid is `12121212`.

    1. After receiving each test event callback, your server needs to respond to the Agora NCS server within 10 seconds with a status code of 200. The response body must be in JSON format.

    When the NCS health test succeeds, press **Save NCS Configuration**.

    If the NCS health test fails, follow the prompts on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to troubleshoot the error. Common errors include the following:

    * Request timeout (590): Your server does not return the status code 200 within 10 seconds. Check whether your server responds to the request properly. If your server responds to the request properly, contact Agora Technical Support to check if the network connection between the Agora NCS server and your server is working.

    * Domain name unreachable (591): The domain name is invalid and cannot be resolved to the target IP address. Check whether your server is properly deployed.

    * Certificate error (592): The Agora NCS server fails to verify the SSL certificates returned by your server. Check if the SSL certificates of your server are valid. If your server is behind a firewall, check whether you have added all IP addresses of the Agora NCS server to the firewall's allowed IP list.

    * Other response errors: Your server returns a response with a status code other than 200. See the prompt on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for the specific status code and error messages.

1. Read the prompt, and click **Save NCS Configuration**.
