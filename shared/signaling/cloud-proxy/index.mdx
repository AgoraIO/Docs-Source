You use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="CP"/> to ensure reliable connectivity for your users when they connect from an
environment with a restricted network.

## Understand the tech

To accommodate your end usersâ€™ firewall settings and business needs, <Vg k="CP"/> offers a HTTP proxy service. The
following figure shows the <Vg k="CP"/> workflow:

![cloud proxy](/images/signaling/cloud-proxy.svg)

The steps you need to implement in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> are:

1.  Before connecting to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, set <Vpd k="SDK" /> to request a connection to <Vg k="CP"/>.

2.  When the request succeeds, <Vg k="CP"/> sends back the proxy information.

3.  <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards this data to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

4.  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards it to <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Prerequisites

To follow this page, you must:

- Setup the [<Vg k="MESS_SDK"/> reference app](/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk#project-setup)

- Contact support@agora.io and enable <Vg k="CP"/> for your project.

- Configure your firewall to allow communication through the <Vg k="CP"/> [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips).
