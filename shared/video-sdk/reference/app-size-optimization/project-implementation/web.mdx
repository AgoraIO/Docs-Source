## Reduce the app size

To reduce the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size, implement the following strategies:

### Use tree shaking

In versions before v4.19.0, the `AgoraRTC` module is the entrance to all callable methods in the Web <Vg k="VSDK" />. Even if you only use a part of the <Vg k="VSDK" />'s functionality, you still need to load the complete SDK, which may result in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> containing a lot of unused code.
Since v4.19.0, the <Vg k="VSDK" /> for Web has integrated [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) support. Using tree shaking has the following advantages:

- Only load the SDK features you actually use, unreferenced code is removed during the build process.
- Reduce redundancy between SDK dependencies and your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> dependencies.

To use tree shaking, import all used methods, enumerations, constants, types, and so on by adding `/esm` at the end of the package name `agora-rtc-sdk-ng`:

```javascript
// Example of correct reference citation method
import { createClient } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference enum
import { ConnectionDisconnectedReason } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference constant
import { VERSION } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference type (it is recommended to use import type instead of import to improve compilation speed)
import type { ICameraVideoTrack } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
```
