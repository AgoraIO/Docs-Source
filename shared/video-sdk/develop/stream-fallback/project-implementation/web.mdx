1. Before joining a channel, the sender calls the `AgoraRTCClient.enableDualStream` method to activate dual stream mode.

2. On the receiving end, the `AgoraRTCClient.setStreamFallbackOption` method is invoked to configure the fallback behavior for receiving media streams in a weak network environment. The parameter `fallbackType` can be set to `1` or `2`:
   - Setting `fallbackType` to `1` ensures that only the host's video stream is received when the downlink network is weak.
   - Setting `fallbackType` to `2` prioritizes the reception of the host's small video stream in a weak network. If video display becomes impossible due to network conditions, only the host's audio stream is received.

   Additionally, after enabling dual-stream mode on the sender's end, the receiver can utilize the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method to specify receiving only the small video stream by setting `streamType` to `1`.

4. During the session, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-fallback")` callback when the received stream transitions between audio and video or pure audio modes. This provides users with insights into the current stream reception status. Similarly, the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-type-changed")` callback is triggered when the received video stream switches between large and small resolutions.

In the provided sample code, `client` refers to the local client object created using `AgoraRTC.createClient`, while the remote audio and video stream object is obtained through the `event.stream-added` event.

```javascript
// Enable dual stream mode
client.enableDualStream().then(() => {
  console.log("Enable dual stream success!")
}).catch(err => {
  console.log(err)
});

// Receiver configuration: In a weak network environment, first attempt to receive the small stream; if video display is not feasible due to current network conditions, only the audio stream is received.
client.setStreamFallbackOption(remoteStream, 2)

// Receiver configuration: In a weak network scenario, to ensure call quality, manually switch the subscribed large video stream to the small video stream.
client.setRemoteVideoStreamType(remoteStream, 1);
```
