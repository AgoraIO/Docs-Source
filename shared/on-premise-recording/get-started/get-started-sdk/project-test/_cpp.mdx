Agora provides a complete recording sample project in the SDK download package. After downloading and extracting the package, follow these steps to compile and run the sample project:

1. Navigate to the sample project directory:

    ```sh
    cd agora_rtc_sdk/example
    ```

2. Build the sample project:

    ```sh
    ./build.sh
    ```

3. Add the SDK library path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:

    ```sh
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../agora_sdk:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

4. Select a configuration file based on your recording scenario:

    * Use `recorder.json` for composite recording.
    * Use `singleVideo.json` for individual recording.
