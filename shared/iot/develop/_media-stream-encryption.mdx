Media stream encryption ensures that only authorized users in a channel see and hear each other. Encryption prevents potential eavesdroppers from accessing sensitive and private information shared in a channel. <Vpd k="NAME"/> provides built-in encryption methods that you can use to guarantee data confidentiality during transmission, when required.

This page shows you how to integrate media stream encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

To ensure secure communication, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an SSL [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_authentication) and a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to encrypt and decrypt
data in the channel. You use the key and salt to create an encryption configuration. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses the encryption configuration to encrypt a stream and sends it to remote users. When a remote user receives an encrypted media stream, the remote <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> decrypts it using the same salt and key.

The following figure shows the call flow for media stream encryption:

All users in a channel must use the same encryption configuration. You set this up when you initiate the Agora Engine and enable encryption before joining a channel. If you donâ€™t have the correct configuration, you cannot decrypt channel content. Best practice is to have your authentication system generate a new key and salt regularly.

<Vpd k="SDK"/> supports the following encryption modes:

* SM4-128-ECB
* AES_128_ECB
* AES_128_XTS
* AES_256_XTS
* AES-128-GCM
* AES-256-GCM
* AES-128-GCM2 (recommended)
* AES-256-GCM2 (recommended)

Compared to other encryption modes, GCM2 encryption uses a more secure key derivation function and supports salt. If you choose another encryption mode, you only need to set the encryption mode and key.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

* Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) v3.0.0 or above.


## Project setup

To encrypt media streams in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you need to:

- Open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement <Vg k="COMPANY" /> media stream encryption

To implement media stream encryption, do the following:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="COMPANY" /> media stream encryption in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1.  Add the 32-byte key to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

    1.  Run the following command in a terminal window:

        ``` bash
        openssl rand -hex 32
        ```

    2.  Paste the key string returned into the `encryptionKey` variable.

2.  Add the 64-byte salt to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

    1.  Run the following command in your terminal window:

        ``` bash
        openssl rand -base64 32
        ```

    2.  Paste the salt string returned into the `encryptionSaltBase64` variable.

3.  [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<ProjectTest />

Communication between your test devices is now end-to-end encrypted. This prevents data from being read or secretly modified by anyone other than the true sender and recipient.
