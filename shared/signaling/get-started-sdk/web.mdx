## Project setup

To create a <Vpd  k="SDK" /> development environment:

1. Clone the [<Vpd  k="SDK" /> sample project](https://github.com/AgoraIO/signalign-sdk-samples-js) to
  `<samples-root>` on your development machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/signaling-sdk-samples-js.git
    ```

2. Open the sample project in your development environment.



## Implement Signaling

The code that goes here must have

  * Variables: signalingEngine, signalingManager, channelName. In the get started channel name is fixed.  APIkey etc as video calling.
  * All Agora code in signalingManager, all UI code in another class
  * Does the following:
  * Login and logout. signalingEngine is initiated at login and destroyed at logout.
  * joinChannle, leaveChannel
  * listen for events in the channel
  * Logging




## Test your app

This section explains how to run the sample project and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Best practice is to run this project on a physical mobile device, as some simulators may not support the full features of this project.

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY"
  /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
