To manage audio mixing and voice effects, <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides the following APIs:

| Function | Sound effect | Audio mixing |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Play or stop playing a specific audio file     | `preloadEffect`<br/> `unloadEffect`<br/> `playEffect`<br/> `stopEffect`<br/> `stopAllEffects`  | `startAudioMixing`<br/> `stopAudioMixing`       |
| Pause or resume playing an audio file          | `pauseEffect`<br/> `pauseAllEffects`<br/> `resumeEffect`<br/> `resumeAllEffects` | `pauseAudioMixing`<br/> `resumeAudioMixing`    |
| Get and adjust playback position and volume   | `setEffectPosition`<br/> `getEffectCurrentPosition`<br/> `getEffectsVolume`<br/> `setEffectsVolume`<br/> `setVolumeOfEffect` | `getAudioMixingCurrentPosition`<br/> `setAudioMixingPosition`<br/> `getAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `getAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume` |
| Report playback status of audio files          | `onAudioEffectFinished`                       | `onAudioMixingStateChanged`                    |

### Play sound effects

After joining a channel, call `playEffect` to play the specified sound effect file. Call `playEffect` multiple times to set multiple sound effect IDs and play multiple files simultaneously. When the playback is finished, the SDK triggers the `onAudioEffectFinished` callback.

Refer to the following code example:

    ```typescript
    // Register the sound effect playback completion callback
    const EventHandler = {
        onAudioEffectFinished: (soundId) => {
            console.log(`soundId:${soundId}`);
        }
    }
    rtcEngine.registerEventHandler(EventHandler);
    
    // Playing sound files
    rtcEngine.playEffect(
        soundId: 0, // Setting the Sound ID
        filePath: 'your file path',  // Setting the sound file path
        loopCount: 1, // Sets the number of times the sound effect is looped. 1 means looped once.
        pitch: 1.0, // Sets the pitch of the sound effect. 1.0 indicates the original pitch.
        pan: 0, // Sets the spatial position of the sound effect. 0.0 means the sound effect appears directly in front
        gain: 100, // Sets the sound volume. 100 indicates the original volume.
        publish: false, // Sets whether or not to publish the sound to the remote end
        startPos: 0, // Sets the playback position of the sound effect file. 0 means playback starts from the 0th ms of the sound effect file.
    );
    ```

### Incorporate audio mixing

Call the `startAudioMixing` method to play a music file. When the music mixing state changes after a successful call to this method, the SDK triggers the `onAudioMixingStateChanged` callback to report the changed music file playback status and the reason for the change.

Refer to the following code example:

    ```typescript
    // Register the music file's playback state has changed callback
    const EventHandler = {
        onAudioMixingStateChanged: (state, reason) => {
            console.log(`state:${state}, reason:${reason}`);
        }
    }
    rtcEngine.registerEventHandler(EventHandler);
    
    // Playing Music Files
    rtcEngine.startAudioMixing(
        filePath: 'your file path',  // Setting the music file path
        loopback: false, // Sets whether music files are only played locally. false Indicates that locally played music files are published to the remote end, and both local and remote users can hear the music
        cycle: -1, // Sets the number of times the music file is played. -1 means infinite loop playback
        startPos: 0, // Sets the playback position of the music file. 0 means playback starts from the 0th ms of the sound file.
    );
    ```
