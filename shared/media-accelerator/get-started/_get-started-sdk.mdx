The Internet of things (IoT) is a network of physical objects with sensors, processors, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices. In applications such as smart door bells and remote monitoring, IoT devices must send or receive audio and video streams to perform their function. <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> enables you to implement real-time audio and video stream transmission and intercommunication in IoT devices with a small SDK size, low memory usage, and low power consumption. Some typical application scenarios for <Vpd k="SDK" /> include:

* **Real-time monitoring**:  Integration into smart cameras and smart doorbells enables mobile device users to receive video feed from one or more cameras.

* **Two-way audio communication between mobile devices**: With <Vpd k="SDK" /> integrated into smart watches, users perform two-way audio communication between mobile devices.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate audio and video communication features into your IoT devices using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

The light-weight <Vpd k="SDK" /> is ideal for IoT applications due to its low power consumption. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides the following performance benefits:

* **Small SDK size**: The increase in app size is less than 400 KB after integration.
* **Low memory usage**: When the SDK is simultaneously sending and receiving 320x240 H.264 video data, memory usage is less than 2 MB.
* **High connectivity**: Under normal conditions, connectivity is greater than 99%.
* **Low bandwidth usage**: A maximum of 50 Mbps for a user in an RTC channel.
* **Network adaptability**:	Non-aware recovery from up to 50% packet loss.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate this feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to add <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.


## Implement <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> functionality

At startup, you initialize the RTC service. When a user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. 

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" />  to implement <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
<ProjectTest />
