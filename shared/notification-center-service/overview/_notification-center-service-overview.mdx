Agora provides the Notification Center Service (NCS) to inform you of channel events in real time when you use the Real-time Communication (RTC) service.


## Understand the tech

The following figure illustrates how the Agora NCS works:

1. Once the Agora NCS is enabled, the Agora service server notifies the Agora NCS server when a subscribed event occurs.
1. The Agora NCS server informs your server of that event through an HTTPS POST request.
1. When receiving the request, your server must respond to the Agora NCS server within 10 seconds. The response body must be in JSONformat.
1. When receiving your response with the status code of 200 within 10 seconds after sending the request, the Agora NCS server considers the notification callback is sent successfully.If the Agora NCS server does not receive your response within 10 seconds after sending the request, or if the HTTP status code received from your server is not 200, the notification callback is considered to have failed. The Agora NCS server immediately resends the notification callback after the failure.The interval between these notification attempts gradually increases, until the server stops sending notifications after three retries.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the Agora NCS, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* A valid Agora account. If you do not have an Agora account, seeSign up for an Agora account.
* An active Agora project. If you do not have an Agora project, seeCreate a project in Agora Console.
* Internet access. If your network access is restricted by a firewall, call the IP address query API to get the IP addresses of the Agora NCS server and configure the firewall to allow these IP addresses.
