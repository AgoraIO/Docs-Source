### Create a project

Take the following steps:

1. To start a new Windows Forms application project in Visual Studio, see 
[Create a Windows Forms app in Visual Studio with C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017/ide/create-csharp-winform-visual-studio?view=vs-2017).

2. Open the **Configuration Manager** window, select **New** in the **Active solution platform** drop-down menu, and choose **x64** or **x86** as the target platform in the pop-up window.

### Integrate the SDK

Use the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio to integrate the SDK into your project. See [Quick Start: Installing and Using Packages in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio)  for details.

### Create a user interface

To experience video calls intuitively, you need to create a user interface (UI) based on the application scenario. If you already have a user interface in your project, you can skip this step.

If you want to achieve audio and video interaction, it is recommended to add the following controls to the UI:

local view window
remote view window
Join channel button
Leave channel button
Refer to the following steps to create the UI.

Create Join and Leave buttons

a. In your project, open the Solution Explore window, double-click Form1.cs , open the Toolbox window, select the Button control, add two buttons in sequence, and drag and drop the two buttons to the appropriate location. b. Move the mouse to one of the buttons, right-click the mouse, select Properties , and in the opened Properties window, modify the Text property to Join and the Name property to btnJoin . c. Repeat the previous step to modify the properties of another button: modify Text to Leave ; modify Name to btnLeave .

Create local and remote view windows

a. Open the Toolbox window, select the PictureBox control, and add controls at the appropriate locations for the local view and remote view in turn. b. Move the mouse to the local view window control, right-click the mouse, select Properties , and modify the Name property to videoboxLocal in the opened Properties window ; modify the BorderStyle to FixedSingle . c. Repeat the previous step to modify the properties of the remote view window control: modify Name to videoboxRemote ; modify BorderStyle to FixedSingle .

Create channel name input box

a. Open the Toolbox window, select the TextBox control, and then drag it to the appropriate position. b. Move the mouse to the added input box control, right-click the mouse, select Properties , and modify its property Name to txChannelName .

Save the changes from the above steps.

Double-click the Join and Leave buttons respectively , and the IDE will automatically associate the click event handler function.

At this point your UI interface is as shown below:
