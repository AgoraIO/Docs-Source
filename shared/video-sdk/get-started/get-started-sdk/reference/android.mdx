### Next steps

After implementing the quickstart sample, read the following documents to learn more:

* The sample code in this document uses a temporary token to join a channel. To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, best practice is to obtain a token from an authentication server. For details, see [Secure authentication with tokens](./get-started/authentication-workflow).

### Sample project

Agora provides open source sample projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples) for your reference. Download or view the [JoinChannelVideo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/main/Android/APIExample/app/src/main/java/io/agora/api/example/examples/basic/JoinChannelVideo.java) project for a more detailed example.
