### Create a project

To set up your web project, create a folder named `agora_web_quickstart`. A Web client project must contain the following files:

* `index.html`: Specifies the user interfaces for web applications.
* `basicEngagement.js`: Contains `AgoraRTCClient` code that implements specific application logic.
* `package.json`: Used to install and manage project dependencies. Create the file using the command line by going into the `agora_web_quickstart` folder and running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm init package.json
    ```

### Integrate the SDK​

Take the following steps to integrate <Vpd k="SDK"/> into your project:

1. Add the following configuration to `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "agora_web_quickstart",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "basicEngagement.js",
        "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
        },
        "dependencies": {
            "agora-rtc-sdk-ng": "latest"
        },
        "author": "",
        "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

2. To import the `AgoraRTC` module into your project, add the following code to `basicEngagement.js`:

    ```js
    import AgoraRTC from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng"
    ```

### Create a user interface​

Copy the following code to `index.html` to implement a basic client user interface:
