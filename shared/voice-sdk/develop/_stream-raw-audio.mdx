In some scenarios, raw audio captured through the microphone must be processed to achieve the desired functionality or to enhance the user experience. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to pre and post process the captured audio for implementation of custom playback effects.

## Understand the tech

You can use the raw data processing functionality in <Vpd k="SDK" /> to process the feed according to your particular scenario. This feature enables you to pre-process the captured signal before sending it to the encoder, or to post-process the decoded signal before playback. To implement processing of raw audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you take the following steps.

1. Setup an audio frame observer.
1. Register the audio frame observer before joining a channel.
1. Set the format of audio frames captured by each callback.
1. Implement callbacks in the frame observers to process raw audio data. 
1. Unregister the frame observers before leaving a channel.

The figure below shows the workflow you need to implement to process raw audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to integrate custom audio and video in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement raw data processing

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
When a user captures video and audio data, the data is available to the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> for processing before it is played. This section shows how to retrieve this data and process it, step-by-step.
</PlatformWrapper>

## Test your implementation

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
To ensure that you have implemented raw data processing into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
