</TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. [Create a user interface](#create-a-user-interface) for your app. A basic UI consists of the following components:
    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
    * Local view window
    * Remote view window
    * Buttons to join and leave the channel
    </ProductWrapper>
    <ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
    * A button to join the channel.
    * A button to leave the channel.
    </ProductWrapper>

5. Create and set up a script to implement <Vpd k="NAME" /> and bind the script to the canvas.

    1. Create a new script and import the UI library.

        1. In the **Project** tab, navigate to **Assets > Agora-Unity-RTC-SDK > Code > Rtc**, right-click and select **Create > C# Script**. A new file named `NewBehaviourScript.cs` appears in your Assets.

        1. Rename the file to `JoinChannel.cs` and open it.

        1. Import the Unity namespaces to access UI components by adding the following code at the top of the file:

            ```c#
            using UnityEngine;
            using UnityEngine.UI;
            ```
    1. Bind the script to the canvas. 

        In `Assets/Agora-Unity-RTC-SDK/Code/Rtc` , select the `JoinChannel.cs` file, and drag it to the Canvas. In the **Inspector** panel, ensure that the file is bound to the Canvas.

### Install the SDK

1. Go to the [Download SDKs](../../sdks?platform=unity) page and download the latest version of the Unity SDK.
1. In Unity Editor, navigate to **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**, and select the unzipped SDK.

    All plugins are selected by default. Deselect any plugins you don't need, then click **Import**.
