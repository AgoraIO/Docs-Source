Audio quality requirements vary with application scenario. For example. in professional scenarios such as radio stations and singing competitions users are particularly sensitive to audio quality. In such cases, support for dual-channel and high-quality sound is required. High-quality sound means setting a high sampling rate and a high bitrate to achieve realistic audio. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to configure audio encoding properties to meet such requirements. 

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">

This article shows you how to use <Vpd k="SDK"/> to configure appropriate audio encoding properties and application scenarios in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

<Vpd k="SDK"/> uses default encoding parameters and a default audio scenario that are suitable for most common applications. If the default settings do not meet your needs, refer to the examples in the implementation section to set appropriate audio encoding properties and an application scenario.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project. 

## Implementation
