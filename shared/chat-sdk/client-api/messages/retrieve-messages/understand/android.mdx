The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. The followings are the core methods:

- `asyncFetchConversationsFromServer`: Retrieves a list of conversations stored on the server.
- `asyncFetchHistoryMessage`: Retrieves the historical messages in the specified conversation from the server.
- `removeMessagesFromServer`: Deletes historical messages from the server unidirectionally.
- `deleteConversationFromServer`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.
