    When you don't need to send messages to a topic anymore, or the number of topics you join at the same time exceeds the limit, you can leave a topic to free up resources. When you leave a Topic successfully, the SDK will trigger an `onTopicEvent` event of type `REMOTE_LEAVE`, and all users in the channel with Topic event listening enabled will be notified of this event.

    The sample code is as follows:

        ```java
        mStreamChannel.leaveTopic("Motion", new ResultCallback<Void>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(Void responseInfo) {
                log(CALLBACK, "leave topic success");
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(ErrorInfo errorInfo) {
                log(ERROR, errorInfo.toString());
            }
        });
        ```

    When you no longer need to send messages to a Topic, or the number of concurrently joined Topics exceeds the limit, you can leave a Topic to free up resources. When you successfully leave a topic, the SDK will trigger the `didReceiveTopicEvent` event of type `AgoraRtmTopicEventTypeRemoteLeaveTopic`, and all users in the channel who have enabled Topic event listening will be notified of this event.

    The sample code is as follows:

    ```objc
    [stream_channel leaveTopic:@"your_topic" completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
                if (errorInfo == nil) {
                    NSLog(@"leave topic success!!");
                } else {
                    NSLog(@"leave topic failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);

                }
            }];
    ```

    When you no longer need to send messages to a Topic, or the number of concurrently joined Topics exceeds the limit, you can leave a Topic to free up resources. When you successfully leave a topic, the SDK will trigger an `onTopicEvent` event of type `RTM_TOPIC_EVENT_TYPE_REMOTE_LEAVE_TOPIC`, which will be notified to all users in the channel who have enabled Topic event listening.

    The sample code is as follows:

        ```cpp
        int ret = stream_channel->leaveTopic("topic_name", req_id);
        if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
          printf("leaveTopic failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
        }
        ```

    After calling this method, the SDK triggers the `onLeaveTopicResult` callback and returns the result of the API call:

        ```cpp
        // Asynchronous callback
        class RtmEventHandler : public IRtmEventHandler {
          void onLeaveTopicResult(const uint64_t requestId, const char *channelName, const char *userId, const char *topic, const char *meta, RTM_ERROR_CODE errorCode) override
          {
            if (errorCode != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
              printf("LeaveTopic failed error is %d reason is %s\n", errorCode, getErrorReason(errorCode));
            } else {
              printf("LeaveTopic success\n");
            }
          }
        };
        ```
