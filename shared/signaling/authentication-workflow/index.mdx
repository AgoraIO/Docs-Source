Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. <Vg k="COMPANY" />
uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access <Vg k="MESS" />. Each token is valid
for a limited period and works for a specific UID only. For example, you cannot use a token generated for UID
`john` for UID `doe`.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use
it to connect securely to <Vg k="MESS" /> as a specific user. You use this server for development
purposes. To see how to develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read
[Token generators](/signaling/get-started/integrate-token-generation).

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns an authentication token that is valid for a specific user. A token server generates two types of tokens:

* To initialize the <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" />, you use an RTM token. An RTM token is valid only for the user Id that you use to generate it.
* To join a stream channel, you use an RTC token. An RTC token is valid only for the channel name and the user Id that you use to generate it.

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="MESS"/>:

![token authentication flow](/images/signaling/authentication-workflow.svg)

To initiate the <Vg k="MESS" /> engine, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves an RTM token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token  to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. 

To join a stream channel you request an RTC token from the server by supplying a user Id and a channel name. You do not need an authentication token to subscribe to a message channel. 

A token contains the following information:

-   The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The [App certificate](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The User Id of the user to be authenticated

-   The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

-   The channel name (only for RTC tokens)

When the token is about to expire, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends an event to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and you renew the session with a new token.

## Prerequisites

To follow this page, you must have:

- Set up the [<Vg k="MESS_SDK"/> reference app](/en/signaling/develop/get-started-sdk#project-setup).
-  Created a cloud platform account that is verified through your GitHub account. The following platforms are
currently supported:
    - [Render](https://render.com/)
    - [Railway](https://railway.app/)
    - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

To integrate a token generator directly into your security infrastructure, see [Token generators](/signaling/get-started/integrate-token-generation).

## Implement the authentication workflow

In the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an authentication token obtained manually to join a channel. In a production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1.  [Create and run a token server](#create-and-run-a-token-server)
2.  [Retrieve and use tokens from a token server](#authentication-using-the-sdk)

### Create and run a token server

### Authenticate your <Vg k="MESS"/> session
