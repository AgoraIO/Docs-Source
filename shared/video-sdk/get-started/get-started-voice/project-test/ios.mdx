Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In your code update the `appId` and `token`, with the app ID and temporary token you obtained from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channelName` you filled in when generating the temporary token.

1. Connect your iOS device to your computer.

1. Click **Build** to run your project and wait a few seconds for the app installation to complete.

4. Allow the app to access the device's microphone and camera.


5. If an untrusted developer prompt pops up on the device, click **Cancel** to close the prompt, then open **Settings > General > VPN and Device Management** on the iOS device, and choose to trust the developer in the **Developer APP**.

1. On a second <Vpl k="NAME" /> device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel and test audio communication.
