This page introduces how to enable and configure Flexible Classroom in Agora Console. 

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

* An <Vg k="COMPANY" /> [account](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account) and [project](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-project).

* The whiteboard feature in Flexible Classroom requires third-party cloud storage. Currently, Flexible Classroom supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a>.

## Enable Flexible Classroom

Follow these steps to enable the Flexible Classroom service in Agora Console:

1. Log into Agora Console and navigate to the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.
2. On the **Project Management** page, find the project for which you want to enable the Flexible Classroom service, and click **Edit**.

## Configure classroom storage and recording

To setup and configure storage and recording in for your classrooms:

1.  **Setup third-party cloud storage**

    1. On the **Flexible Classroom configuration** page, find the whiteboard module, as shown in the following figure:

        ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641366278596)

    1. Enable the advanced services. See [Enable whiteboard server-side features](/interactive-whiteboard/develop/enable-whiteboard#enable-whiteboard-server-side-features).

    1. Configure a third-party cloud storage service for storing files uploaded in a classroom. Fill in the following information:
          - `region`: The location of the data center you specified when creating a bucket in Amazon S3.
          - `endpoint`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as `s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.
          - `Bucket`: The bucket name in Amazon S3.
          - `folder`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as `whiteboard`.
          - `accessKey`: The Access Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to identify visitors.
          - `secretKey`: The Secret Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to authenticate signatures.

       <div class="alert info">For how to get these information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html" target="_blank">document of Amazon S3</a>.</div>

1. **Configure your classroom**

     1. Find the cloud recording module on the **Flexible Classroom configuration** page in Agora Console:

        ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641368314262)

    1. Configure storage

        Pass in the `storageConfig` JSON object for storing recorded files. Use the following fields to specify the url and storage location of the recording file.
        
        * `endpoint`: (required) String. The full path composed of the Bucket name and the access domain name. For example, if your Bucket name is "agora-recording", and the OSS access domain name is "oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com", then the `endpoint` field is set to `https:// agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com`

         * `fileNamePrefix`: (Optional) JSONArray. An array of strings that sets the path of the recorded files in the third-party cloud storage. For example, if `fileNamePrefix = ["directory1","directory2"]`, Agora Cloud Recording will add the prefix `directory1/directory2/` before the name of the recorded file. You can also use variables to specify a dynamic path. 

         Sample `storageConfig`:

         ```json
         {
               "vendor": 2,
               "region": 3,
               "bucket": "xxxxx",
               "accessKey": "xxxxxxf",
               "secretKey": "xxxxx",
               "endpoint": "https://agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com",
               "fileNamePrefix": [
                  "scenario",
                  "recording"
               ]
         }
         ```

         For complete parameter descriptions, see [storageConfig](../../cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#cloud-storage-configuration).

    1. Configure recording.

       By default, you record teacher audio and video in [composite recording mode](../../cloud-recording/develop/composite-mode). Your recorded files are stored in Agora's Amazon S3 account. To change the default behavior, Pass in the `recordingConfig` JSON object:

        ```json
        {
            "maxIdleTime": 30,
            "streamTypes": 2,
            "channelType": 0
        }
        ```

       For parameter descriptions, see [recordingConfig](/cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#recording-configuration).


## Considerations
To ensure that Agora can access files in your third-party cloud storage space, you should enable public access or higher permissions for third-party storage spaces.

#### AWS S3 account configuration

Configure your AWS S3 account as follows:

* Bucket policy

   ```json
   {
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Id":"Policy1622700880591",
      "Statement":[
         {
            "Sid":"Stmt1622700872941",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":"*",
            "Action":"s3:GetObject",
            "Resource":"arn:aws-cn:s3:::agora-adc-artifacts/*"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

* Cross-origin resource sharing

   ```json
   [
      {
         "AllowedHeaders":[
            "*"
         ],
         "AllowedMethods":[
            "PUT",
            "GET"
         ],
         "AllowedOrigins":[
            "*"
         ],
         "ExposeHeaders":[
            
         ]
      }
   ]
   ```
