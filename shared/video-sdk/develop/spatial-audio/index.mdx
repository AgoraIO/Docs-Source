 <Vg k="SPATIAL" /> provides an immersive audio experience for users in e-sports, online meetings, and other entertainment scenarios. Spatial audio effects in <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> enable you to:

- Update the spatial positions of users in real time to give a sense of change in the distance, direction, and orientation of other users.
- Update the spatial position of the media player, to add a sense of space to background sounds, accompaniments, and other media resources.
- Add effects such as sound blurring and air attenuation by adjusting audio settings.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, windows">

This page shows you how to implement <Vg k="SPATIAL" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides a local Cartesian coordinate system calculation scheme for setting up spatial audio positions for users and the media player.

#### Audio effects for users

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="ios,macos">
Use an instance of `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` to implement spatial audio. Call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to specify the spatial coordinates of local and remote users in the channel. <Vpd k="SDK"/> calculates the relative positions of local and remote users. This enables local users to experience the spatial audio effect of remote users.
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="ios,macos">
Use an instance of `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` to implement spatial audio. Call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to specify the spatial coordinates of local and remote users in the channel. <Vpd k="SDK"/> calculates the relative positions of local and remote users. This enables local users to experience the spatial audio effect of remote users.
</PlatformWrapper>

#### Audio effects for media player

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="ios,macos">
Call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` methods of the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to update the spatial coordinates of local users and the media player. The SDK calculates the relative positions of local users and the media player. This enables local users to experience the spatial audio effect of the media player.
</PlatformWrapper> 

<PlatformWrapper platform="ios,macos">
Call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` methods of the `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` class to update the spatial coordinates of local users and the media player. The SDK calculates the relative positions of local users and the media player. This enables local users to experience the spatial audio effect of the media player.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project. 

<Admonition type="info" title="information">The 3D spatial audio feature is currently in the experimental stage. Please contact [support@agora.io](support@agora.io) for activation. </Admonition>

<PlatformWrapper platform="windows">

To maintain spatial audio effects during broadcasts with Bluetooth headphones, best practice is to adhere to the following structured guidelines:

1. Use the A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) transmission protocol for audio playback.
1. Employ Bluetooth headphones exclusively for audio playback purposes.
1. Use alternate devices for audio capture tasks.

Not adhering to these guidelines might result in difficulty experiencing spatial audio effects.
