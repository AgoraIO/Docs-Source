The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to provide message receipt. Followings are the core methods:

- `ChatOptions.setRequireAck`: Enables message read receipt.
- `ChatOptions.setRequireDeliveryAck`: Enables message delivery receipt.
- `ackConversationRead`: Sends a conversation read receipt.
- `ackMessageRead`: Sends a message read receipt.
- `ackGroupMessageRead`: Sends a message read receipt for group chat.

The logic for implementing these receipts are as follows:

- Message delivery receipts

  1. The message sender enables delivery receipts by setting `ChatOptions.setRequireDeliveryAck` as `true`.
  2. After the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically sends a delivery receipt to the sender.
  3. The sender receives the delivery receipt by listening for `onMessageDelivered`.

- Conversation and message read receipts

  1. The message sender enables read receipt by setting `ChatOptions.setRequireAck` as `true`.
  2. After reading the message, the recipient calls `ackConversationRead` or `ackMessageRead` to send a conversation or message read receipt.
  3. The sender receives the conversation or message receipt by listening for `onConversationRead` or `onMessageRead`.
