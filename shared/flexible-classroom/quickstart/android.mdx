## Project setup

To set up your <Vg k="FC" /> project, download the source code.

The source code for Flexible Classroom is located in the Github [CloudClass-Android](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Android) repository. To download the source code, take the following steps:

1. Clone the repository locally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Android.git
   ```

1. After the download is complete, navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd CloudClass-Android
   ```

1. Agora recommends switching the branch to the latest release. To switch the branch version, run the following command. Remember to replace `{VERSION}` with a specific version number:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/{VERSION}
   ```

   For example, if you want to switch to the branch for version `2.7.1`, run the command:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/2.7.1
   ```

   The following image shows how to find the latest release branch in the GitHub repository:

## Implement a flexible classroom

Follow these steps to configure and launch your <Vg k="FC" /> from the downloaded source code:

1. **Sync the Android project**

   Android Studio automatically performs a gradle sync to downloads the dependencies.

1. **Update the parameters**

   Copy your *App ID* and *App Certificate* from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />]((https://console.agora.io/)) and replace the values of *agora_app_id* and *agora_app_cert* in `CloudClass-Android\app\src\main\res\values\string_config.xml`.


## Test your implementation

1. Connect a physical Android device to your development device.

1. In Android Studio, click **Run app**. A moment later, the project is installed on your device.

1. In the login screen, enter the **Room**, your **Name**, the class **Type**, your **Role** and your current **Region**, then click **Enter**.
