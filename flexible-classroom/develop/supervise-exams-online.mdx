Online proctoring refers to supervision of examinees through their web cameras, microphones, and by
sharing their screens during online exams. This can be useful in the following cases:

- College exams
- Professional/certification exams
- Recruitment

<Vg k="FC"/> provides <Vg k="FC_PROCTOR_SDK"/> to implement such supervision. Agora recommends a scenario where one examiner
proctors 25 to 50 examinees at the same time. This page illustrates how the supervision feature works for an examiner
and an examinee using the [<Vg k="FC"/> web demo](./reference/downloads?platform=web).

## How to use online proctoring

The following example uses the <Vg k="FC"/> web demo to illustrate how examinees and examiners use the online
proctoring feature.

### Examiner role

1. As an examiner, open the <Vg k="FC"/> web demo and click **Create** to create a room.

   ![flexible_classroom_web_demo](/images/flexible-classroom/fc_web_demo.png)

2. Enter the classroom name, class start and end time, then select **Online Proctoring** in **Class mode** and click **Create**.

   ![create_classroom_web_demo](/images/flexible-classroom/create_classroom_web_demo.png)

   You have now successfully created a classroom under the proctoring scenario. In the <Vg k="FC"/> demo,
   the room creator holds the examiner role by default.

3. Test your hardware before entering the room to ensure that you can monitor the exam.

   ![online_proctoring](/images/flexible-classroom/online_proctoring.png)

   |Hardware   |Purpose                                                      |
   |:----------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
   |Camera	   |To broadcast to all examinees and transmit your video        |
   |Microphone |To broadcast to all candidates and transmit your voice       |
   |Speaker	   |To monitor the sound of the examinees' environment           |

   Once hardware is successfully tested, click **Next step** to enter the room.

4. After you enter the room, the exam will start automatically at the preset time. You can also click **Start Exam**
to start the exam manually.

   During the exam you will see monitor screens, or surveillance walls, for all examinees. You can do the following:
- Switch the layout and filter surveillance walls

   ![start_exam](/images/flexible-classroom/start_exam.png)

- Broadcast video and audio to all examinees

   ![broadcast_video_audio](/images/flexible-classroom/broadcast_video_audio.png)

- Click the surveillance wall of an examinee to enter the monitoring details page

   ![monitoring_details](/images/flexible-classroom/monitoring_details.png)

   On the monitoring details page, you can see the recording view and the monitoring view:

        - The recording view shows the examinee's video and screen recordings from the start of the exam to the current time. You can drag the time axis to jump to a specific time, or click a submitted abnormal event to jump to the time point of the event.

        - The monitoring view shows the real-time video and screen sharing of the examinee. If the examinee demonstrates abnormal exam behavior (cheating), you select the corresponding event and submit it. Preset abnormal events include multiple people on camera, cheat sheets, identity verification, and use of electronic devices. Abnormal events are customizable.

   If there are examinees that you suspect of cheating without solid evidence, you can pay closer attention to them. To do so,
   click the focus icon on the monitoring details page to add them to the corresponding list. You can then filter surveillance
   walls in the main proctoring page to show only those that require your special attention.

5. The test will end automatically when the test time is over, or you can manually click End Test to end the test in advance.

### Examinee role

1. As an examinee, open the <Vg k="FC"/> web demo and click **Join**.

   ![join_classroom](/images/flexible-classroom/join_classroom.png)

2. Enter the room ID, select the **Student** role, and click **Join**.

   ![enter_name](/images/flexible-classroom/enter_name.png)

   In the <Vg k="FC"/> demo, a room joiner holds the examinee role by default.

3. Test your hardware capabilities before entering the room.

   ![join_exam](/images/flexible-classroom/join_exam.png)

   |Capability	|Purpose|
   |:--------------------------|:---------|
   |Hardware detection	       |<ul><li>Microphone: To monitor the sound of your surrounding environment</li><li>Camera: To visually monitor your environment </li><li>Speaker: To receive the examiner's broadcast sound </li></ul>|
   |Portrait photography       |To verify your identity |
   |Screen sharing	           |To monitor your screen  |

   Once your hardware is succesfully tested, click **Join Exam**.

4. After entering the classroom, you will see the exam paper, the video from your main and secondary camera, and the video
of your shared screen. You will also see the examiner's video when they broadcast.

   ![take_exam](/images/flexible-classroom/take_exam.png)

   Your exam paper will be automatically displayed at the beginning of the exam and automatically submitted at the end of the exam,
   unless you submit it manually before that.

5. When the exam is complete, click **Leave**.
