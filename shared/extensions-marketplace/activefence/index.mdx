[<Vg k="RTEE_AF" />](https://www.activefence.com/) is the leader in providing Trust & Safety solutions to protect online platforms and their users from malicious behavior and content. By integrating <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> capabilities in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you can design the exact content moderation solution you need. Content moderation is powered by ActiveFence AI-driven automated detection for text, audio, image, and video content that enables you to moderate, enforce policies, manage user flags, and send notifications across multiple abuse areas and languages.

This page shows you how to integrate and use the <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> content detection and moderation extension in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

The development environment requirements are as follows:

<Prerequisites />

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, web, flutter, react-native">
- Implemented <Link to="../../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> for <Vg k="VIDEO"/></Link>.
</PlatformWrapper>

- If you use the RTC SDK token, ensure that you're using AccessToken2 to enable the ActiveFence video content moderation extension. See [Upgrade AccessToken2](/signaling/develop/authentication-workflow?platform=android#upgrade-accesstoken2).

## Project Setup

In order to configure <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />:

1. **Setup your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account**

    1. Either:
        - In <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/marketplace/list/all">Agora Extensions Marketplace</Link>, select
    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />, then click **Activate Your Account**.

        <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends you an email with activation details.


    1. Open the <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> email and follow the instructions to activate your  <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account.

        During this process, you open <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" /> in your browser.


1. **Configure your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API Key**

    You use <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API keys for authentication when you send images to the <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> content moderation API.

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.

        **Account Settings** opens.

    1. Email <Vg k="COMPANY" /> this key information. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses this key to share data using <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API.

1. **Connect your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> to your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account**

    In order for <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> to monitor data streamed to a channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />,   <Vg
    k="RTEE_AF"/>  needs to bind your App ID to your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account. To do this:

    1. Send <Vg k="COMPANY" /> an email at support@agora.io requesting <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> activation with your:
        - Company name
        - Company email
        - Agora APP-ID,
        - <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API Key

    1. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> activates communication between your  <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and  <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> and supplies any extra credentials to you.

    1. <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> communicates any extra credentials to you.

1. **Customize your callback fields**

    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> allows you to add custom fields for your callbacks. Take the following steps to add custom callback fields:

        1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, open **Account Settings** by clicking the **Settings** icon on the top-right.

        1. Click **Moderation Capabilities** > **Custom Fields**.

        1. Press **Add Field** and choose **EDITABLE** to open an **Add an editable field** window.

            ![Add an editable field](/images/extensions-marketplace/active-fence-add-an-editable-field.png)

        1. Repeat the step multiple times to add the following fields:

            | Title & Key | Type | Meaning |
            |:------------|:-----|:--------|
            | cname | Text | RTC channel name |
            | requestId | Text | Request Id of the screenshot |
            | sid | Text | Session Id |
            | source | Text | Source of screenshot (agora) |
            | timestamp | Number | Timestamp, For example, 20230614050206430 |
            | uid | Number | User id (unique in a channel) |

    See [<Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> docs](https://docs.activefence.com/#section/Integrating-with-the-TandS-Platform-How-To/Custom-Fields) for more information about custom fields.

1. **Configure Action webhooks**

    1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click **Data Management** > **Webhook Key Management**, then click **Add Key**.

    1. In **Add API Key**, fill in the form and click **Generate Key**.

        You use this key to authenticate calls to your webhook. If do not use authentication, you do not need this key.

    1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click **DATA MANAGEMENT** > **Action Webhooks**, then click **Add Webhook**.

    1. In **Add Action Webhook**, update the following fields and click **Save**.

        - **Action** - The name for this webhook.
        - **Related Entity** - Set to `content`.
        - **Endpoint URL** - The FQDM for your webhook. For example: `https://my.super.duper/webhook`.
        - **Request Method** - Set to POST.
        - **API Key** - For authenticated requests to your webhook. Choose the key you configured earlier. If you
        do not require authentication, set to No auth.


    1. In **Body**, configure the format of the JSON object and data sent to your webhook. For example:

        ```json
          {
              "contentUrl":"$contentUrl",
              "status":"$status",
              "userId":"$userId",
              "addedAt":"$addedAt",
              "contentId":"$contentId",
              "reason":"$violationsCategories",
              "metaData": "$metaData"
          }
        ```

1. **Configure the trigger for your webhook**

    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> monitors the data sent in a channel. When content matches conditions in a workflow,
    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends a PUSH request to your webhook with information about the channel, the data sent and
    the user who sent it.

    1. **Create an Action**

        1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.
        1. Click **Moderation Capabilities** > **Action Management**, then click **Add Action**
        1. In **Choose Action Type**, click **Enforce**, then click **Next**
        1. Fill **Action Name**, then **Choose Webhook**.

        Whenever a workflow or a moderator triggers the Action, the webhook is activated.

    1. **Configure automated workflows**

        Rule-based workflows in <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" /> are triggered by any data point, and start any Action you created.
      To add a new workflow.

        1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the hamburger menu at the top left, click **Workflows**.

        1. Click **Create New** and follow the UI to set the:

            - Initiator - the subset of data applicable for this workflow. For example, **Abusive** or **Harmful**. In the
      parameter picker on the right side menu, choose a **Violation Type**.
            - Condition - further rules routing data according to different criteria. For example, **Risk Score equals 90**.
            - Action - the result of the workflow for any item that matches its conditions. For example, suspent. This is a system action or a webhook.

            Workflows are only active after you enable them.


1. **Invite users and start moderating with <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />**

    1. In  <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />, click the Settings icon on the top-right.

    1. Click **Users** > **Account Users**.
