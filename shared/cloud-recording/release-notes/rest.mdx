### 2025.06.27

#### New features

- **Support for self-built cloud storage services**
    
    This version adds support for self-built cloud storage services. When calling the `acquire` and `start` interfaces, you can specify self-built cloud storage by setting `vendor` to `11`. Specify the domain name of your self-built cloud storage using the `endpoint` parameter under `extensionParams`.

    <CodeBlock language="json">
    {`"storageConfig": {
    "secretKey": "xxxxx",
    "accessKey": "xxxxx",
    "bucket": "s3-digit-test",
    // highlight-start
    "vendor": 11,
    // highlight-end
    "region": 0,
    "fileNamePrefix": [
      "agora",
      "meituan",
      "test"
    ],
    "extensionParams": {
      // highlight-start
      "endpoint": "xxxxx.xxxxx.com"
      // highlight-end
    }
  }`}
    </CodeBlock>


### 2024.08.02

This release adds the following improvement:

To improve the security of Cloud Recording, this release adds optional `stsToken` and `stsExpiration` fields to the `storageConfig` of the `start` and `update` requests. You need to ensure that the validity period of `stsToken` and `stsExpiration` is long enough, so that Cloud Recording can successfully upload files to a third-party cloud storage. For details, see and [API reference](../reference/rest-api/rest).

### 2023.07.05

This release adds the following improvements:

- Adds support for the following regions of Alibaba Cloud storage:
    * `23`: CN_Nanjing
    * `24`: CN_Fuzhou
    * `25`: CN_Wulanchabu
    * `26`: CN_Northeast_2
    * `27`: CN_Southeast_7

- Updates the Agora transcoding script to reduce background noise.

### 2022.11.20

This release adds the following improvements:

- Improves player compatibility for MPD files generated in individual recording `standard` mode, see [Recording configuration](../reference/restful-api#recordingconfig).
- Optimizes the Agora Format Converter Script for individual recording, you can refer to [Merge audio and video files](../develop/merge-files) to get the latest Agora Format Converter Script.

### 2022.10.20

This release supports the postpone transcoding feature globally. You need to set the scene field to `2` (postpone transcoding) when calling the `acquire`. After setting this scene, the recording service transcodes the recorded file within 24 hours after recording to generate an MP4 file, and uploads the MP4 file to the third-party cloud storage you specify. Please note that the `region` of the third-party cloud storage must be consistent with the `region` set when calling `acquire`. For details, see [Individual recording](../develop/individual-mode).

### 2022.8.12
This release adds support for Amazon S3 in some regions. See [Cloud storage configuration](../reference/region-vendor).

### 2022.5.20

This release adds the following new feature and API changes:

**Mobile web page mode for web page recording**

This release adds mobile web page mode for web page recording. The API changes are as follows:

- Adds the `mobile` field in `extensionServiceConfig`. After setting `mobile` to `true`, the recording service uses the mobile web page mode to record the current web page.
- The value range of the `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` fields in `extensionServiceConfig` is changed to [240, 1920].

**Transcoder script for high availability mechanism**

In composite recording mode, Agora provides a transcoder script for merging the old M3U8 file with the new M3U8 file generated after the service enables the high availability mechanism into an MP4 file. For details, see [Manage Recorded Files](./develop/manage-files#when-a-server-is-disconnected-or-the-process-killed).

### 2022.1.20
#### New features

**Individual Audio Non-transcoding Recording**

In order to meet the diverse recording needs of users, this release adds the [`streamMode`](../reference/stream-mode) parameter in the `start` method to support [Individual Audio Non-transcoding Recording](../develop/individual-nontranscoding).

**Postpone Audio Mixing**
For voice chat use-cases, this release adds the [`appsCollection`](../reference/restful-api#appscollection) and [`transcodeOptions`](../reference/restful-api#transcodeoptions) parameters in the `start` method to support [Postpone Audio Mixing](../develop/individual-nontranscoding#implement-an-postpone-audio-mixing). If you enable this function, the recording service merges and transcodes the recorded files of all user IDs in the specified channel within 24 hours after the recording ends to generate an MP3/M4A/AAC file, and then uploads the recording file to your specified third-party cloud storage.

**A Combined audio and video file after individual recording**

When calling `start`, set the `streamMode` field of the [`recordingConfig`](../reference/restful-api#recordingconfig) parameter to `standard`, you can get a M3U8 audio index file, a M3U8 video index file and a combined M3U8 audio and video index file. If VP9 encoding is used on the web side, a combined MPD audio and video index file are generated.
You can play the combined audio and video index file directly without using script. Agora recommends that you use this mode.

**Support for the third-party cloud storage service encrypting and labeling recording files**

This release adds the [`extensionParams`](../reference/restful-api#extensionparams) field to support the third-party cloud storage service to encrypt and tag uploaded recording files. This feature is applicable to Amazon S3 and Alibaba Cloud OSS.
### 2021.12.09

#### New features

### 2019.10.08

**New features**

#### 1. Individual recording

The RESTful API adds individual recording mode, which supports recording the audio and video of each user ID separately. See [Individual Recording](../develop/individual-mode) for details. Meanwhile, Agora provides the Audio & Video File Merging script, which you can use to merge the audio and video files generated in individual mode. See [Merge Audio and Video Files](../develop/merge-files) for details.

#### 2. Record specified user IDs

The RESTful API adds the `subscribeAudioUids` and `subscribeVideoUids` parameters, which allow you to record only specified user IDs.

#### 3. Customize the directory of the recorded files

The RESTful API adds the `fileNamePrefix` parameter, which allows you to specify the directory where you want to store the recorded files in the third-party cloud storage.

#### 4. Timestamp when the stream state changes

The RESTful API callback service adds the `recorder_audio_stream_state_changed` and `recorder_video_stream_state_changed` events to report the time when the state of the audio or video stream changes, as well as the corresponding user ID.

#### 5. Format Converter script

Agora provides the Format Converter script, which you can use to convert between multiple file formats, such as TS, MP3, and MP4. See [Convert File Format](../develop/convert-format) for details.

#### 6. Synchronized playback

You can achieve synchronized playback between the recorded files and other stream files, such as online whiteboards, courseware, and messages, by using the timestamp when the recording starts. You can get the timestamp by using the RESTful API callback service, or by parsing the M3U8 file. See [Synchronized Playback](../develop/playback) for details.

**Improvement**

When an error occurs, you receive the error message in the HTTP response body, instead of just the error code. See [Agora Cloud Recording RESTful API](../reference/rest-api-overview#error-codes-for-the-agora-cloud-recording-service) for detailed information about the error codes.

**Fixed issue**

When uploading fails after you use the wrong `bucket` and `key` values of the third-party cloud storage, Agora Cloud Recording returns an error instead of uploading the recorded files to Agora Cloud Backup.

You can update the layout anytime during the recording by the `updateLayout` method.

#### Customized background color

The RESTful API adds the `backgroundColor` parameter to support customized background colors for the video layout.

#### Timestamps

To get the accurate starting time of a recording, the RESTful API provides the Unix timestamp of when the first slicing starts in the response of the `query` method.  The RESTful API callback service adds the `recorder_slice_start` event to report the time when the first slicing starts and the time when the last recording fails.

**Improvement**

Optimizes the verification of whether `resourceId` corresponds with `uid` and `cname` when calling the RESTful API.
