# Agora's Adaptive HD Video Strategy: The Key to Exceptional Live Streaming Experiences

In today's rapidly digitizing world, live streaming has become an integral part of people's lives. Whether it's corporate meetings, online education, or entertainment live streams, a high-definition and smooth video experience is crucial to attracting and retaining viewers. To meet this demand, Agora has introduced an Adaptive Video Optimization Strategy that automatically adjusts video profile and setting based on device performance and network quality, delivering high-definition and fluid video effects.



Core Advantages of the Adaptive Video Optimization Strategy

The Adaptive Video Optimization Strategy excels in its intelligent adjustment capabilities. It can automatically adjust video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate based on device performance and network conditions, ensuring high-definition and smooth video effects in various scenarios. This strategy not only simplifies user operations but also improves the stability and reliability of live streaming.


How to Use the Adaptive HD Video Strategy

1. Set Initial Video Parameters
Before using the adaptive HD video strategy, you need to set the initial video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. These parameters will serve as the starting point for the strategy's adjustments, which will be made based on device and network conditions.
In the Native RTC SDK, we provide `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method, we can set the iniitial value of `dimensions，frameRate，bitrate` fields of `config` parameter. we reommend to follow up the [Video Profiles](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/enhance-call-quality/configure-video-encoding?platform=android#video-profiles-table) table doc. _please note that when we switch from Single Host use scenario to PK battle use scenario, we should call `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set expected video profile again._


2. Enable the Adaptive HD Video Strategy
Follow up below steps to enable adaptive HD video strategy:
Call `setParameters` API, and set the parameters value as `"che.video.auto_adjust_resolution" : { "auto_adjust_resolution_flag": 1 }`
After completing the above steps, the adaptive HD video strategy will fully take effect. The strategy will automatically adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and bit rate you set in the previous step based on device performance and network quality, achieving high-definition and smooth video effects.

3. Monitoring and Adjustment (Optional)
If some viewers still report video stuttering, you need to further downgrade the video resolution. The idea is as follows: The streamer eanbles the video dual-stream mode and sets the video resolution and other attributes of the video stream to provide a lower resolution, frame rate, and bit rate video stream for viewers with poor conditions. also you can integrate with [Cloud Trancoder](https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/live-streaming-premium-legacy/cloud_transcoder) for Video Multi-Bitrates


Although the adaptive HD video strategy can automatically adjust video properties, you still have the option to further optimize the video effect through monitoring and adjustment. For example, you can adjust the initial video parameters based on your needs or monitor video quality and network conditions in real-time using Agora's APIs.

Application Scenarios for the Adaptive HD Video Strategy

1. Corporate Meetings
In corporate meetings, the adaptive HD video strategy ensures that participants, regardless of their location, can enjoy a clear and smooth video experience. This not only improves meeting efficiency but also enhances communication and collaboration among participants.

2. Online Education
Online education places stringent demands on video quality. The adaptive HD video strategy automatically adjusts video properties based on students' network and device conditions, ensuring they receive high-quality teaching content. Additionally, this strategy reduces network latency, improving the real-time interaction between teachers and students.

3. Entertainment Live Streams
In entertainment live streams, a high-definition and smooth video experience is crucial to attracting viewers. The adaptive HD video strategy ensures that broadcasters and viewers can enjoy satisfactory video effects in any network environment. This not only improves the viewing experience for viewers but also enhances broadcasters' attractiveness and influence.



**In Conclusion**

The adaptive HD video strategy is a vital feature offered by Agora, delivering a high-definition and smooth live streaming experience through intelligent video property adjustments. To use this strategy, you only need to set the initial video parameters and enable the strategy. Additionally, you can optimize the video effect through monitoring and adjustment as needed. Whether it's corporate meetings, online education, or entertainment live streams, the adaptive HD video strategy provides exceptional live streaming experiences.
