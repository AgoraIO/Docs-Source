A **subscription package** is a prepaid billing method. You can purchase a package in the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io) to cover usage for the current month.

### Purchase and upgrade

By default, each project is assigned the **Free Package** upon creation. You can upgrade at any time to the **Basic**, **Premium**, **Ultimate**, or **Enterprise** package. Higher-tier packages provide greater discounts and lower unit prices. For details, see [Pricing strategy](pricing-strategy).

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- All packages except the **Enterprise Edition** can be purchased directly in the console. To upgrade to the **Enterprise Edition**, contact [sales@shengwang.cn](mailto:sales@shengwang.cn).
- You can upgrade sequentially or skip levels. For example, you may upgrade from **Free** to **Ultimate** directly.
- Package upgrades take effect immediately on the day of the upgrade. If multiple upgrades are made on the same day, the **latest upgrade** prevails.

#### Upgrade rules

* **Price amortization**: If you upgrade mid-month, the upgrade cost is calculated based on the remaining days in the month.
  *Example*: Upgrading from **Free** to **Ultimate** on August 15:
  `Upgrade Fee = (Ultimate Price − Free Price) / 31 × 17`

* **Quota amortization**: The monthly quota is prorated based on the days before and after the upgrade.
  *Example*: Upgrading from **Basic** to **Ultimate** on August 16, with 100,000 minutes used:
  `Quota = (105,000 × 15/31) + (1,500,000 × 16/31) = ~832,258 minutes`

### Renewal

To avoid service disruption, Agora recommends enabling **auto-renewal**. When enabled, your package renews automatically on the **25th of each month**. Make sure your account has sufficient balance to avoid renewal failure.

If renewal fails:

* The system sends a notification and retries the renewal.
* If renewal fails by the end of the month, your package will be **downgraded to Free**.
* To restore the previous package, refer to [Purchase and Upgrade](#purchase-and-upgrade).

If auto-renewal is disabled, the package will automatically downgrade to **Free** after the current subscription expires.

### Downgrade

You can downgrade by selecting and purchasing a lower-tier package. Downgrades take effect on the **next renewal date**, depending on when the request is made.

#### Examples:

* **Requested on August 15**: Downgrade takes effect on **August 25**, changing September’s plan.
* **Requested on August 26**: Downgrade takes effect on **September 25**, changing October’s plan.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- You can cancel a downgrade request before it takes effect.
- While a downgrade request is pending, you cannot make further upgrade/downgrade changes.
</Admonition>

### Cancel subscription

Direct cancellation of a subscription package is not supported. To cancel, downgrade to the **Free Package** using the [downgrade process](#downgrade).

## Top-up package

A **top-up package** is a one-time pay-as-you-go plan. You can purchase a top-up package from the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io) to cover usage that exceeds your monthly package quota.

### Purchase

You can purchase multiple top-up packages. They are deducted in the order of purchase.

#### Example:

* Purchased 250,000-minute packages on **August 15** and **August 16**. On **September 1**, the first package is used before the second.

### Validity

Each top-up package is valid for **1 year**, starting from the purchase date to the end of the same month the following year.

#### Example:

* Purchased on **August 15, 2024** → valid until **August 31, 2025**

Unused minutes expire after the validity period and cannot be carried forward.

### Cancel top-up package

Cancellation of top-up packages is **not supported**.
