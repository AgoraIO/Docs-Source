Agora’s Fastboard SDK provides recording and playback features for all interactions in a live room. It offers higher efficiency and smoother playback than traditional screen recording.

Fastboard recording and playback provide the following advantages:

- **High-efficiency recording**: Uses signaling-based recording that reduces bandwidth usage and storage requirements.
- **High-quality playback**: Recreates live room interactions with clear visuals and smooth animations.
- **Server-side recording**: Performs all recording on the server. No additional processing is required on the client.
- **Flexible playback**: Supports time-range playback, playback controls, and camera tracking.
- **Complete recording**: Captures all interactive behavior such as whiteboard operations, custom events, viewpoint changes, and multi-window applications.
- **Built-in UI**: Includes ready-to-use playback components with theme and language customization.

This page describes how to enable whiteboard recording and how to use the Fastboard SDK to play back whiteboard content.

## Understand the tech

This section describes how Interactive Whiteboard recording and playback work and highlights the benefits of this model.

#### Recording

Interactive Whiteboard recording does not capture the screen. Instead, it records proprietary binary data that includes signaling and incremental updates. The server performs the entire recording process, which provides the following advantages:

- **Automatic recording**: To start recording, enable the recording function when you create a room. The server automatically records all interactions in the room.
- **Intelligent management**: The server generates recording data only when the room is active. Recording stops automatically when the room becomes inactive.
- **Compact data**: The recorded data is smaller and uses less storage compared to traditional audio and video formats.
- **Multi-window support**: The recorder captures all applications and operations in Fastboard's multi-window mode.

#### Playback

The Fastboard SDK uses the playback capabilities of the underlying Whiteboard SDK and provides a simplified API with built-in UI components. During playback, the SDK incrementally reconstructs the scene using recorded signaling and data, reproducing the experience of real-time interaction. Playback supports:

- Playback within a specified time range
- Playback controls such as play, pause, and skip
- Playback speed adjustment
- Camera follow mode and free camera mode
- Replay of custom events and global state changes
- Full replay of multi-window applications

## Prerequisites

To enable recording and playback with the Fastboard SDK, you need the following:

- The Agora Fastboard SDK integrated into your project. See [Fastboard quickstart](../get-started/get-started-uikit) for details.
- An Agora project with the <Vg k="WHITE" /> enabled. Get the app identifier and room token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. See [Enable and configure <Vg k="WHITE" />](../get-started/enable-whiteboard) and [Generate a room token](../get-started/get-started-uikit#generate-a-room-token).
- A room created on your business server. See the [Room management](../reference/whiteboard-api/room-management) server API for details.
