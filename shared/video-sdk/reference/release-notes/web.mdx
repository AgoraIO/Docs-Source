## Overview

<Vpd k="NAME"/> 4.x is a JavaScript and TypeScript library loaded by an HTML web page. The SDK library uses APIs in the web browser to establish connections and control the communication and interactive live streaming services.

### Compatibility

See [Supported platforms](../reference/supported-platforms).

### Known issues

Known issues in <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> are:

#### Chrome deprecates and removes the Plan B dialect

Chrome plans to deprecate and remove the Plan B dialect in WebRTC. For details, see the [Chrome feature description](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5823036655665152).

If you use any of the following versions of <Vpd k="NAME"/>, best practice is to upgrade to the latest version:

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">

| Version   | Impact  |
|---|---|
| v2.5.0 - v2.9.0 <br></br> v3.0.0 - v3.6.1  |  After a stream is published, calls to `switchDevice` cause video freeze or no sound issues. |
| v4.0.0 - v4.0.1 |  The `publish` and `subscribe` methods do not have any effect. |

</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">

| Version   | Impact  |
|---|---|
|  v4.0.0-4.0.1 |  The `publish` and `subscribe` methods do not have any effect. |

</ProductWrapper>

## v4.17.0

v4.17.0 was released on March 15, 2023.

#### New features

**1,000 hosts in a channel (Beta functionality)**

As of v4.17.0, a single channel can support up to 1,000 concurrent online hosts, who can publish media streams at the same time.
The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To turn on this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**Local video compositing (Beta functionality)**

As of v4.17.0, the SDK can be used with the video compositing extension to combine multiple video streams and images
into one video stream locally. You can also use the Virtual Background extension to achieve a portrait-in-picture effect.

**Dynamic switching of local video streams**

This release adds the `ILocalVideoTrack.replaceTrack` method to increase the flexibility to switch local video tracks.

For example, to switch from one camera to another before v4.17.0, you needed to call `IAgoraRTCClient.unpublish` to
unpublish the current track and then call `IAgoraRTCClient.publish` to publish a new track.
As of v4.17.0, you can call `ILocalVideoTrack.replaceTrack` directly.

#### Improvements

**Optimized reconnection mechanism**

As of v4.17.0, the SDK defaults to showing the last video frame before disconnection during reconnection,
which prevents a black screen during the reconnection process. This optimization is not available on Safari due to Safari's limitations.

**Other improvements**

This release also includes the following improvements:

- The accuracy of SDK-related quality metrics on [Analytics](/agora-analytics/overview/product-overview) is improved.
- The time required to join a channel is reduced. This optimization is not available on Firefox due to Firefox's limitations.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `ILocalVideoTrack.replaceTrack`

**Deleted**

- `ILocalVideoTrack.setBeautyEffect`

#### Fixed issues

On Safari on iOS 14.7 and later, performing subscribing and unsubscribing operations repeatedly to multiple audio streams could result in not hearing remote users.

## v4.16.1

<Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> v4.16.1 was released on February 7, 2023.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issue:

- When using Video SDK for Web v4.16.0, the video freeze rate showed in Agora Analytics is much higher than the correct value.

## v4.16.0

<Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> v4.16.0 was released on January 5, 2023.

#### Improvements

This release adds the following enhancements:

**Compatibility for deprecated RTCMediaStreamTrackStats on Chrome**

Chrome plans to deprecate the stats dictionary `RTCMediaStreamTrackStats`.
See the service announcement on [discuss-webrtc@googlegrooups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/9c8ZjberEcI).
This change affects the following media track statistics returned by the SDK:

|  Statistics             | Affected fields                                              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LocalVideoTrackStats`  | <li>`sendFrameRate`</li><li>`sendResolutionHeight`</li><li>`sendResolutionWidth`</li> |
| `RemoteVideoTrackStats` | <li>`receiveFrameRate`</li><li>`receiveResolutionHeight`</li><li>`receiveResolutionWidth`</li><li>`renderFrameRate`</li><li>`receiveDelay`</li> |
| `RemoteAudioTrackStats` | <li>`receiveDelay`</li><li>`receiveLevel`</li>               |

To ensure the accuracy of these media track statistics on Chrome, please upgrade the SDK to v4.16.0 or later as soon as possible.

**Other improvements**

This version of the SDK also includes the following improvements:

- The cause of the  [`HTMLMediaElement` error event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/error_event)
is now recorded in the log.
- The size of the SDK package is reduced.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- Media operations failed when the SDK was attempting to reconnect to the network.
- When relaying media streams across channels, [`ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration.addDestChannelInfo`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/web/4.x/interfaces/ichannelmediarelayconfiguration.html#adddestchannelinfo)
could not set `uid` to `0` to identify the relay stream in the destination channel.
- Some known issues on iOS 14.x.


## v4.15.1

v4.15.1 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issue:

- No audio was received on iOS 13.7.

## v4.15.0

v4.15.0 was released on October 31, 2022.

#### New features

The latest features in this release are:

##### Audio stream filter (Beta)

v4.15.0 introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, Agora SD-RTN™ ranks all subscribed audio streams by volume. By default, the three audio streams with the highest volume are transported to others in the channel. To change the number of audio streams to be transported, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

Agora enables channel hosts to control whether the audio streams being published are filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered bypass this filter mechanism and are transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios with a large number of publishers, enabling this function helps reduce the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

To enable this function, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

##### VP9 codec (Beta)

Video SDK for Web v4.15.0 adds support for the VP9 codec in the following browsers:

|         | Supported browsers<sup>①</sup>                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Desktop | <li>Chrome 65 or later</li><li>Firefox 69 or later</li><li>Edge 79 or later</li> |
| Android | <li>Chrome 68 or later</li><li>Wechat v8.0.6 or later </li><li>Other apps that use WKWebView: WebView v55.0.28883.91 or later</li> |
| iOS     | N/A                                                          |

<div class="alert info">① To ensure the best user experience, best practice is to use the latest version of the browsers listed above.</div>

To start a call using the VP9 codec, apps you connect to built using for Android, iOS, Windows, or macOS must use Video SDK v4.0.1 or greater.

##### CSP violation callback

v4.15.0 adds the `AgoraRTC.onSecurityPolicyViolation` callback. When Agora fails to load a resource or send a request due to Content Security Policy(CSP) violations, the Video SDK triggers this callback. When you receive this callback, modify your CSP configuration to ensure that you can access Agora-related services.

#### Improvements

The SDK has the following improvements:

- The accuracy of network quality reported by `AgoraRTCClient.on("network-quality")` in certain scenarios has increased.
- Resumption of audio or video streams when the user switches between Wi-Fi networks is faster.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `IAgoraRTC.onSecurityPolicyViolation`

#### Compatibility changes

Cloud Proxy default mode has changed. In Video SDK for Web v4.15.0, the `mode` parameter in `startProxyServer` defaults to `3`. This represents the Force UDP cloud proxy mode. In this mode, Video SDK always transmits data over UDP. For details, see [Restricted network connection with Cloud Proxy](/video-calling/develop/cloud-proxy).

## v4.14.2

v4.14.2 was released on October 27, 2022.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issue:

- When using WeChat browsers on iOS 14.x, no audio is received from the first channel the user subscribes to.

## v4.14.1

v4.14.1 was released on October 24, 2022.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- On Electron v17.x, screen sharing did not work properly. To solve this issue, add the following code in the main process:
  ```javascript
  const {  ipcMain, desktopCapturer } = require("electron");

  ipcMain.handle("DESKTOP_CAPTURER_GET_SOURCES", (event, opts) => desktopCapturer.getSources(opts));
  ```
- On desktop Safari, if autoplay was blocked for all videos, they kept trying to replay resulting in video freeze.
- On mobile browsers, the video freeze rate calculated by the SDK was higher than the actual value when the browser was running in the background.
- In Android WebView, the default poster (a gray play button) of the video element showed before video playback.
- Media stream relay failed after the SDK resumed connection to the network.
- During a media stream relay, the SDK continued to send heartbeats after the user left the source channel.

## v4.14.0

v4.14.0 was released on August 31, 2022. 

#### Compatibility changes

**getVolumeLevel accuracy improvement**

As of v4.14.0, the SDK calibrates the calculation of the volume returned in  `getVolumeLevel`. The volume range is still [0,1], where 1 represents the highest audio level. If your business scenario depends on the volume returned in `getVolumeLevel`  (for example, a speaker icon shows according to the volume), ensure that you check the returned volume after upgrading to v4.14.0.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issue:

- The received Opus stereo audio had no stereo effect.
- On versions earlier than Chrome 76, the `decodeFrameRate` returned by the `getRemoteVideoStats` method was 0.
- On WeChat browsers running on iOS 14.1 and 14.2, the first subscribed audio stream was silent.
- After calling `LocalVideoTrack.setBeautyEffect` to enable image enhancement, calling `LocalVideoTrack.unpipe` caused an error.
- On Windows Chrome 103 and later versions, enabling the dual-stream mode did not take effect in certain scenarios.

## v4.13.0

v4.13.0 was released on July 25, 2022.

#### New features

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Adding support for media processing extensions**

As of v4.13.0, the SDK supports using media processing extensions on remote audio and video tracks (extension support for local audio and video tracks was added in [v4.10.0](#410)).

Currently, Agora provides the following extension for remote audio tracks:

| Extension | Description| Documentation|
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spatial Audio Extension (Beta) | Enables a real-time audio blurring or air absorption effect for a user's audio based on the user's position relative to other users, which makes conversations more immersive. | Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) for full details. |

</ProductWrapper>
#### Improvements

**AI Noise Suppression and virtual background**

The AI Noise Suppression extension and virtual background extension are converted from beta release to official release. To experience the AI Noise Suppression or virtual background extension, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**Callback for token expiration**

v4.13.0 improved the logic of triggering the callback for token expiration. If a token expires when the user's device is in sleep mode or disconnected from network, the SDK triggers the `token-privilege-did-expire` event when the device resumes operation and attempts to reconnect to the SDK.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `RemoteAudioTrack.pipe`
- `RemoteAudioTrack.unpipe`
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
- `RemoteVideoTrack.pipe`
- `RemoteVideoTrack.unpipe`
</ProductWrapper>
## v4.12.2
v4.12.2 was released on July 7, 2022. This release improved the automatic mode for SDK connectivity (In this mode, the SDK first attempts a direct connection to Agora SD-RTN™; if the attempt fails, the SDK automatically switches to TCP/TLS 443).

## v4.12.1
v4.12.1 was released on June 27, 2022. This release fixed the following issues:

- Subscribing to remote streams occasionally failed after disconnection.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">

#### Improvements

**Media processing extensions**

Media processing extensions have the following changes:

- The [Image Enhancement Extension (Beta)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-extension-beauty-effect) is released. This extension incorporates and upgrades the built-in image enhancement feature (enabled by  <Link to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/ilocalvideotrack.html#setbeautyeffect">setBeautyEffect</Link>)) of the Agora Web SDK 4.x. You can adjust parameters including the contrast, brightness, and smoothness levels, in order to touch up the image for effects such as skin lightening and skin smoothing. For details, see [Use the Image Enhancement Extension](./beauty_effect_web_ng).
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
- The [Virtual Background Extension (Beta)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-extension-virtual-background) supports animated virtual backgrounds as of v1.0.0-beta-3. You can set a user's background as a short video. For details, see [Use the Virtual Background Extension](./virtual_background_web_ng).
</ProductWrapper>
#### Fixed issues

v4.11.1 was released on May 9, 2022. This release fixed the following issues:

- Subscribing to audio streams might cause no sound on Firefox.
- Compatibility issues occurred in Safari on iOS 12 and in the WeChat built-in browser on iOS 13.

## v4.11.0

v4.11.0 was released on April 1, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

As of v4.11.0, the SDK adopts an automatic mode by default to ensure connectivity. In this mode, the SDK first attempts a direct connection to Agora SD-RTN™; if the attempt fails, the SDK automatically switches to TCP/TLS 443. You can listen for such auto-switch events through `client.on("join-fallback-to-proxy")`.

#### Improvements

**Channel capacity improvement**

As of v4.11.0, a single channel can support up to 128 concurrent online hosts, who can publish media streams at the same time. The number of audience members in a channel is unlimited. Each host or audience member can subscribe to a maximum of 50 hosts at the same time.

To experience this improvement, contact support@agora.io.

####  Fixed issues

v4.11.0 fixed the following issues:

-   Angular’s dependency zone.js caused an error when `Promise.finally` was called in the SDK.

-   On Chrome, AEC could not be enabled when sending stereo sound.

-   On Chrome 100, the SDK reported inaccurate statistics for the decoding frame rate and sending frame rate.

-   When dual-stream mode was enabled, calling `unpublish` without parameters caused the method call to fail.

## v4.10.2

v4.10.2 was released on March 24, 2022. This release fixed the issue that calling `join` in certain scenarios might cause proxy exceptions.

## v4.10.1

#### New features
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Setting the video stream type of all remote users**

v4.9.0 adds the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method. After you call `enableDualStream` to enable dual-stream mode on the senders' clients, `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` enables receivers to choose whether to receive the high-quality or low-quality stream of all remote users.
</ProductWrapper>
**Cloud Proxy Force TCP mode**

v4.9.0 adds Force TCP mode for the Agora Cloud Proxy service. In this mode, the SDK always transmits data over TLS 443. To use this mode, set `mode` as 5 when calling `startProxyServer`.

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Checking the visibility of the `<video>` HTML tag**

After you call `play`, the SDK creates an `<video>` HTML tag for playing video tracks. v4.8.0 adds the following methods and events for checking the visibility of the `<video>` tag:

- `localVideoTrack.on("video-element-visible-status")`
- `remoteVideoTrack.on("video-element-visible-status")`
- `localVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`
- `remoteVideoTrack.getVideoElementVisibleStatus`

When `localTrack.isPlaying` or `remoteTrack.isPlaying` is `true` but you cannot see any video, the above methods or events can help you check whether the `<video>` tag is visible or not and learn the reason when the `<video>` tag is invisible.

-   Avoided the [black screen issue](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230532) that might occur when using `videoTrack.play(element, {mirror: true})` to play the video on the desktop or mobile Safari 15 browser.
</ProductWrapper>
-   Fixed the issue that calling `AgoraRTC.checkSystemRequirements()` on the Edge browser only returned `false`.

## v4.7.1

v4.7.1 was released on September 13, 2021. This release fixed some issues on Safari 11 and iPad Chrome.

## v4.7.0

v4.7.0 was released on September 1, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

As of v4.7.0, if you enable media stream encryption, the SDK automatically disables encryption and resets the encryption configurations after a user leaves the channel. To re-enable the encryption, call `setEncryptionConfig` before the user joins the channel again.

#### Improvements

This release makes the following improvements:

-   Optimizes the end-user experience of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> on the mobile browser.

-   Improves the accuracy of the volume obtained by `getVolumeLevel`.

-   Adds the support of enabling dual-stream mode on Safari.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

-   After calling `LocalAudioTrack.setVolume` to adjust the local volume, the local user could not perceive the volume change.

-   When the log level was set to none, the SDK nevertheless output the initialization logs.

-   The promise returned by `LocalAudioTrack.setDevice` could get stuck in a pending state.

## v4.6.3

v4.6.3 was released on August 10, 2021. This release fixed an occasional issue: After the user closes a tab or browser on the local client, the remote client does not receive the `user-left` event immediately.

## v4.6.2

v4.6.2 was released on July 30, 2021. This release fixed the issue that the SDK did not destroy all the media players created during a call or live streaming. Chrome 92 introduced a limit on the number of media players that can be created in a particular tab: 75 for the desktop. After you play tracks several times, the undestroyed media players in the SDK might cause the playback failure in the tab.

## v4.6.1

v4.6.1 was released on July 21, 2021. This release fixed an internal error.

## v4.6.0

v4.6.0 was released on July 16, 2021.

#### New features

**Interactive Live Streaming Standard**

As of v4.6.0, the <Vpd k="NAME"/> supports Interactive Live Streaming Standard. The major difference between Agora Interactive Live Streaming Standard and Agora Live Interactive Streaming Premium is the latency level on the audience’s client:

-   Interactive Live Streaming Premium: Ultra-low latency (400 ms to 800 ms) from the host’s client to an audience member’s client.

-   Interactive Live Streaming Standard: Low latency (1500 ms to 2000 ms) from the host’s client to an audience member’s client.

The charges for Standard and Premium are different. For details, see the [product overview](./product-overview) and [pricing](./pricing) of Interactive Live Streaming Standard.

You can set the latency level of the audience role in the following two ways:

-   When calling `createClient` to create a client object, set the `role` parameter as `"audience"` and the `level` parameter in `clientRoleOptions` as `1`.

-   When calling the `setClientRole` method, set the `role` parameter as `"audience"` and the level parameter in `clientRoleOptions` as `1`.

**The mute states of local tracks**

v4.6.0 adds the `localTrack.setMuted` method to stop sending the media data of local tracks. The differences between this method and `localTrack.setEnabled` are as follows:
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   After the method call of `localVideoTrack.setEnabled(false)` to stop sending video, the SDK also immediately turns off the camera light and stops video capture, while `localVideoTrack.setMuted` does not stop video capture.
</ProductWrapper>
-   Calling `setEnabled(true)` takes longer to resume sending the media data than by than calling `setMuted(false)`.

#### Improvements

**Dealing with autoplay blocking**
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
To deal with the autoplay blocking of video on iOS, v4.6.0 deprecates the `onAudioAutoplayFailed` callback, and adds the `onAutoplayFailed` callback instead to indicate an audio or video autoplay failure.
</ProductWrapper>
On most web browsers, inaudible media are not affected by autoplay blocking. However, on iOS Safari with low power mode enabled, or on other iOS in-app browsers that implement a custom autoplay policy, such as the WeChat browser, the autoplay of inaudible media is blocked.

#### Issues fixed

v4.6.0 fixes the following issues:

-   The method call of `localAudioTrack.setVolume` did not take effect immediately.

-   Using multiple clients on one web page caused unexpected issues.

-   The SDK did not check whether the App ID was a string of 1 to 256 bytes in size.

## v4.5.0

v4.5.0 was released on May 25, 2021.

#### New features

**AEC (Acoustic Echo Canceller) for the audio played on the local client**

In a scenario where multiple users play a media file at the same time, such as watching a movie together, if the user A plays the media file through [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) on Chrome with a speaker, the SDK captures the audio played by a speaker together with the voice of the user A. The other users can hear the audio sent by the user A and the audio played locally, which sounds like an echo. To deal with this echo issue, v4.5.0 adds the `processExternalMediaAEC` method. You can call `processExternalMediaAEC` and pass in the `HTMLMediaElement` to enable the AEC for the audio played on the local client.

#### Improvements

**Channel encryption**

To strengthen the security of the key, v4.5.0 adds two encryption modes, `"aes-128-gcm2"` and `"aes-256-gcm2"`, which use the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). When calling `setEncryptionConfig` and setting the encryption mode as `"aes-128-gcm2"` or `"aes-256-gcm2"`, you need to set `secret` and `salt`. For how to generate and set `secret` and `salt`, see [Media Stream Encryption](/video-calling/develop/media-stream-encryption).

**Network geofencing**

As of v4.5.0, when calling setArea to specify the region for connection, you can use the `areaCode` parameter to specify a large region and use the `excludedArea` parameter to specify a small region. The region for connection is the large region excluding the small region. You can only specify the large region as `"GLOBAL"`. For details, see [Network Geofencing](../../video-calling/develop/geofencing).

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**The preset video encoder configurations for screen sharing**

v4.5.0 adds the following preset video encoder configurations for screen sharing in ScreenEncoderConfigurationPreset:

-   `"480p_3"`: The resolution is 640 × 480 and the frame rate is 15 fps.

-   `"720p_3"`: The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 15 fps.

-   `"1080p_3`": The resolution is 1920 × 1080 and the frame rate is 15 fps.
</ProductWrapper>
#### Issues fixed

v4.5.0 fixes the following issues:

-   The `OptimizationMode` setting did not take effect.

-   On iOS, when the <Vpd k="NAME"/> captures media, noises might occur on the local client.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   On Firefox, after the stream transmitted by the SDK switched from high quality to low quality, the video resolution obtained by the `getRemoteVideoStats` method was still the resolution of the high-quality stream.
</ProductWrapper>
-   On Chrome, after you called `remoteAudioTrack.setVolume` to adjust the volume, if the playback was paused and then resumed, the volume changed back to the original one.

-   On Chrome, the `LocalAudioTrack.setVolume` method did not take effect.

#### API changes

**Added**

-   `processExternalMediaAEC`

-   `clientRoleOptions` in `ClientConfig`

-   `options` in the `setClientRole` method

-   `salt` in the `setEncryptionConfig` method

-   `"aes-128-gcm"` and `"aes-256-gcm"` in `EncryptionMode`

-   `excludedArea` in the `setArea` method

## v4.4.0

v4.4.0 was released on April 2, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

**Firewall domain whitelist**

As of v4.4.0, the destination domains required for your firewall whitelist changes to:

    .agora.io
    .edge.agora.io
    .sd-rtn.com
    .edge.sd-rtn.com

If you upgrade the SDK to v4.4.0, update your firewall domain whitelist to ensure you can use Agora products in environments with restricted network access.

#### Improvements

**AES-GCM encryption mode**

In scenarios requiring high security, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data, and to improve the computational efficiency of data encryption, v4.4.0 adds the following encryption modes in `EncryptionMode`:

-   `"aes-128-xts"`: 128-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

-   `"aes-256-gcm"`: 256-bit AES encryption, GCM mode.

Once you enable the built-in encryption, all users in the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key, including the server-side users, such as the Agora recording service.

**Cloud proxy**
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
v4.4.0 adds the `client.on("is-using-cloud-proxy")` event. The SDK triggers this event after the local client successfully publishes a media stream to indicate whether the media stream is forwarded by the [Cloud proxy service](../develop/cloud-proxy).
</ProductWrapper>
**Error code**

If you start media capturing after disabling the media capture device on Windows, the error thrown by the SDK changes from `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` to `NOT_READABLE`.

#### Issues fixed

v4.4.0 fixes the following issues:

-   The SDK did not trigger the `"first-frame-decoded"` event for a remote audio track.

-   The return value of `AgoraRTC.checkSystemRequirement` was inaccurate.

-   When the network had multiple IP addresses, the cloud proxy service did not take effect.

#### API changes

**Added**

-   `client.on("is-using-cloud-proxy")`

-   `"aes-128-gcm"` and `"aes-256-gcm"` in `EncryptionMode`

## v4.3.0

v4.3.0 was released on January 26, 2021.

#### New features

**Cloud proxy**

This release optimizes the Agora cloud proxy architecture and enhances the connectivity of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> in environments with restricted network access. The optimized Agora cloud proxy service also supports regional connection.

You can contact (mailto:support@agora.io) to apply for using the optimized Agora cloud proxy service and set the `mode` parameter as `3` when calling `startProxyServer`. For details, see [Cloud proxy service](../develop/cloud-proxy).

## v4.2.1

v4.2.1 was released on December 23, 2020. This release fixed the incorrect error that the SDK throws when you pass an illegal parameter in the client.publish method.

## v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on December 1, 2020.

#### New features

**Regional connection**

This release adds the `AgoraRTC.setArea` method for specifying the region for connection. After specifying the region, the SDK connects to the Agora servers within that region. The following regions are supported:

-   China

-   North America

-   Europe

-   Asia, excluding Mainland China

-   Japan

-   India

-   Global

This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Video transmission optimization strategy**

This release adds the `localVideoTrack.setOptimizationMode` method for setting the video transmission optimization mode:

-   `"balanced"`: Uses the default transmission optimization strategy.

-   `"detail"`: Prioritizes clarity.

-   `"motion"`: Prioritizes smoothness.

See the API reference for the introduction to each transmission optimization mode. This method applies to scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust the optimization mode during a video call, live streaming, or screen sharing. For example, during the screen sharing, before you change the shared content from slides to a video, you can change the optimization mode from `"detail"` to `"motion"` to ensure smoothness in poor network conditions.
</ProductWrapper>
**Network quality of remote users**

This release adds the `AgoraRTCClient.getRemoteNetworkQuality` method for getting the uplink and downlink network quality of all the remote users to whom the local user subscribes.

**Cloud proxy**

This release changes the `mode` parameter of the `AgoraRTCClient.startProxyServer` method from `boolean` to `number`.

#### Improvements
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   After disabling an audio or video tracks by calling `setEnabled`, you can still call `setDevice` to switch devices.
</ProductWrapper>
-   After you call `AgoraRTCClient.setEncryptionConfig` to enable the built-in encryption, when the user uses a weak secret, the SDK outputs a warning message to the Web Console and prompts the user to use a strong secret. A strong secret must contain at least eight characters and be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

#### Fixed issues
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   When you disabled a local video track, you could not publish another video track.

-   After enabling dual-stream mode, if you called `setEnabled(false)` to disable a video track during the process of publishing, the publishing failed and could not be recovered.
</ProductWrapper>
-   After an audience member tried to publish a local track in live mode but failed, the audience member could not publish this track even after switching the role to host.

-   After dual-stream mode was enabled, a bug during the disconnection would occasionally cause publishing to fail after reconnection.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   After unpublishing a local camera video track and then publishing a screen-sharing track, the video bitrate was fixed at around 700 Kbps, and the resolution and frame rate dropped.
</ProductWrapper>
-   Due to Safari’s limited support for WebAudio, the audio of `BufferSourceAudioTrack` could be distorted.

-   When the SDK gained device permission for the first time, it did not trigger the media device change events (`onMicrophoneChanged`, `onCameraChanged`, or `onPlaybackDeviceChanged`). The SDK only triggered these events for a subsequent device change.

#### API changes

**Added**

-   `AgoraRTC.setArea`
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   `localVideoTrack.setOptimizationMode`
</ProductWrapper>
-   `AgoraRTCClient.getRemoteNetworkQuality`

**Changed**

-   Changed the type of the `mode` parameter in `AgoraRTCClient.startProxyServer` from `boolean` to `number`

## v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on October 27, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

-   Improved the accuracy of the `event_network_quality` event.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   The method call of `createCameraVideoTrack` did not stop on Safari when the SDK cannot find a video capture device.
</ProductWrapper>
-   After calling `unsubscribe` to unsubscribing from an unpublished track of a remote user, the subsequent subscribing and unsubscribing operations failed to take effect.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   Reduced the performance degradation due to frequent method calls of `setEnabled` to enable and disable a video track in dual-stream mode.

-   Occasional errors when `client.getLocalVideoStats` was called on Safari.
</ProductWrapper>
## v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on September 4, 2020.

#### New features
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Screenshot capture**

v4.1.0 adds the `getCurrentFrameData` method which gets the data of the video frame being rendered.
</ProductWrapper>
**Audio playback device management**

v4.1.0 adds the following APIs to manage audio playback devices:

-   `setPlaybackDevice`: Sets the audio playback device, for example, the speaker. This method supports Chrome only.

-   `getPlaybackDevices`: Retrieves the audio playback devices available.

-   `onPlaybackDeviceChanged`: Occurs when an audio playback device is added or removed.

#### Improvements

-   Fully supports Chromium-based versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 80 and later).

-   Improves the accuracy of the `network-quality` event.

-   Supports sharing audio when sharing Chrome tabs on macOS.

#### Fixed issues
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   Information retrieved by `checkVideoTrackIsActive` on Safari is inaccurate.
</ProductWrapper>
-   Occasional failure of reconnection after enabling dual-stream mode.

-   Occasional failure to call `setEnabled` after leaving the channel.

-   Failure to push streams to CDN with transcoding and without transcoding at the same time.

-   Occasional failure to automatically re-subscribe to the remote streams after disconnection, indicated by the `UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE: ERR_SUBSCRIBE_REQUEST_INVALID` error.

-   Failure to join different channels with the same UID in one browser tab.

-   Occasional misreport on connection states due to frequent channel join and leave.

-   The `LocalTrack.getStats` and `RemoteTrack.getStats` methods. Use the `Client.getLocalAudioStats`, `Client.getRemoteAudioStats`, `Client.getLocalVideoStats` and `Client.getRemoteVideoStats` methods instead.
</ProductWrapper>
## v4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on July 18, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:
- Failure to publish local tracks on Chrome 70.
- Publish operation may not be aborted when leaving the channel.

## v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on July 15, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

v4.0.0 deletes the `LocalTrack.setMute` method and adds the `LocalTrack.setEnabled` method for enabling or disabling a local track. The advantages of this change are as follows:

-   Eliminates the concept of "mute" to avoid confusion between mute states and publishing states.

-   In versions earlier than v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the `Client.on("user-mute-updated")` callback when the remote user calls `setMute` to change the mute state.

-   As of v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the existing `Client.on("user-unpublished")` or `Client.on("user-published")` callbacks when the remote user calls `setEnabled` to enable or disable a track.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   After you call `setMute(true)`, the SDK sends black video frames or silenced audio frames. If you mute a local video track, the camera light stays on, which might adversely impact the user experience. In contrast, if you disable a local video track by calling `setEnabled(false)`, the SDK immediately turns off the camera and stops capturing video.
</ProductWrapper>
> The `setEnabled` method changes media input behaviors, so it is an asynchronous operation and returns the result through the `Promise` object.

#### New features
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
**Video encoding strategy**

v4.0.0 adds the `optimizationMode` property in the `CameraVideoTrackInitConfig`, `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig`, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` interfaces. When creating a video track by calling `createCameraVideoTrack`, `createCustomVideoTrack`, or `createScreenVideoTrack`, you can choose whether to prioritize video quality or smoothness by setting optimizationMode as the following:

-   `"detail"`: Prioritizes video quality.

-   The SDK ensures high-quality images by automatically calculating a minimum bitrate based on the capturing resolution and frame rate. No matter how poor the network condition is, the sending bitrate will never be lower than the minimum value.

-   In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the sending resolution, but may reduce the frame rate.

-   `"motion"`: Prioritizes video smoothness.

-   In poor network conditions, the SDK reduces the sending bitrate to minimize video freezes.

-   In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the frame rate, but may reduce the sending resolution.

> The `optimizationMode` property of the video track created by calling createScreenVideoTrack is set as `"detail"` by default.
</ProductWrapper>
#### Improvements
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   Redesigns the `withAudio` parameter in `AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack`. In addition to `enable` and `disable`, you can also set `withAudio` as `auto`. In this setting, the SDK shares the audio, dependent on whether the browser supports this function.

-   Does not allow setting the `withAudio` parameter as `"all"` any more to avoid code repetition. As of v4.0.0, you can only set `withAudio` as `"audio"` or `"video"`. This change involves the following APIs:
</ProductWrapper>
-   The `Client.subscribe` method.

-   The `Client.on("user-published")` and `Client.on("user-unpublished")` callbacks.

#### Fixed issues

v4.0.0 fixed the following issues:

-   After the local user called `unpublish`, the SDK triggerred the `Client.on("user-left")` callback on the remote side.
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
-   Periodic video blur when sharing the screen in `"rtc"` mode.
</ProductWrapper>
-   Occasional publishing failure when calling `publish` and `unpublish` frequently.

-   The `Client.on("network-quality")` callback was inaccurate.
