The example implements the following functionality. After a local user logs in to <Vpd k="NAME" />, they set their metadata in the form of key-value pairs. When the user modifies a value stored as metadata, they call the update method to save the new value. The <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> show a list of all users currently in the channel. When the local user selects another user from the list, the remote users metadata is retrieved and displayed. The local user subscribes to the metadata of remote users to be notified of any changes. The local user can set channel metadata using revision and lock features.

To test this functionality:

1. **Configure the project**

    1. <OpenConfig/>

    1. <SetAppId/>

    1. <SetAuthenticationMethod/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Login to <Vg k="MESS" /> as a first user**

    1. Enter a numeric **User ID** and press **Login** to log in to <Vg k="MESS" />.

    1. Enter a **Channel name** and press **Subscribe** to subscribe to a channel. You see the following:

        1. Your User ID appears in the users list.
        1. You see all the key-value pairs previously saved to the channel metadata.
        1. You see notifications confirming update of user metadata.

4. **Login to <Vg k="MESS" /> as another user**

    1. Launch another reference app instance, and log in using a different **User ID**. Enter the same channel name as before, and press **Subscribe**.

        You see that both User IDs appear in the user lists in both instances.

1. **Test metadata**

    In either instance, type in a **Key** and the **Value** you wish to store in the channel metadata, then press **Update**. You see that the key-value pair is added or updated in the **Channel Metadata** in both instances.

1. **Test version control**

    1. Under **Set channel metadata**, type a new **Value** for an existing channel metadata **Key**. Enter a random positive integer for **Revision** and press **Update**. The log events section shows that the storage operation fails due to `outdated revision`.
    
    1. Update the **Revision** value to show the same number as displayed against the metadata key under **Channel Metadata**, then press **Update** again. This time, the operation succeeds.

1. **Test locks**

    1. Under **Manage Locks**, type a **Lock Name** and press **Set**. You see a `SET` event notification confirming creation of the lock.

    1. In **Lock to apply**, enter the same lock name and press **Update**. You see an error reporting that the lock has not been acquired.

    1. Press **Acquire**. You see an `ACQUIRED` event notification confirming acquisition of the lock. 
    
    1. Press **Update**, this time the channel key value is updated under **Channel Metadata**.

    1. Press **Get**. You see details of all current locks in the logs section.

    1. Press **Release** to release the lock, and **Remove** to delete it.

1. **Test metadata**

    1. In the user bio box, type in some text and press **Update Bio**. You see user metadata `UPDATE` notifications in both instances.

    1. In the other instance, select the user for which you modified the User bio.  You see their updated metadata bio.
