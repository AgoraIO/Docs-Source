When you make an API call to access an Agora SDK, the SDK may return error codes or warning codes:

- **Error codes** are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.
- **Warning codes** are returned when a problem that might be resolved automatically has occurred. Warning codes provide information but normally do not require any action.

This article provides descriptions and troubleshooting tips for common Agora SDK error and warning codes. If you receive a response that is not included here, Agora recommends you contact support@agora.io so that our technical support team can help resolve the issue.
<div class="alert note">An error code can be a negative number. In such a case, it should be read as if it were positive. For example, if the SDK returns error code <code>-2</code>, you should refer to <code>2</code> in the error code table.</div>

## Native platforms and third-party frameworks

This section applies to the Agora <Vg k="VIDEO" /> SDKs designed for:

- Native platforms, such as Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
- Third-party frameworks (third-party platforms where native app code is wrapped), such as Electron, Unity, React Native, and Flutter.

The error and warning codes may be returned in the following ways:

- The return value of a method call, represented by a negative number. In such a case, it should be read as if it were positive.
- An `onError` or `onWarning` callback.


### General errors

| Error code | Cause and troubleshooting tips                               |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`        | No error occurs.                                             |
| `1`        | A general error occurs (no specified reason). Try calling the method again. |
| `2`        | An invalid parameter is used. For example, the specified channel name includes illegal characters. Please reset the parameters. |
| `3`        | The SDK is not ready due to one of the following reasons:<li>`RtcEngine` fails to initialize. Please re-initialize `RtcEngine`.</li><li>No user has joined the channel when the method is called. Please check your code logic.</li><li>Users have not left the channel when the `rate` and `complain` methods are called. Please check your code logic.</li><li>The audio module is disabled.</li><li>The program is not complete.</li> |
| `4`        | `RtcEngine` does not support the request due to one of the following reasons:<li>The `setBeautyEffectOptions` method is called on devices running versions earlier than Android 5.0. Please check the Android version.</li><li>The built-in encryption mode is incorrect or the SDK fails to load the external encryption library. Please check the encryption mode setting or reload the external encryption library.</li> |
| `5`        | The request is rejected due to one of the following reasons:<li>`RtcEngine` fails to initialize. Please re-initialize `RtcEngine`.</li><li>The channel name is set as the empty string "" when creating the `RtcChannel` instance. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>When the `joinChannel` method is called to join one of multiple channels, the specified channel name is already in use. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>The `joinChannel` method in `RtcEngine` is called to join another channel after an `RtcChannel` instance has been created to join a channel and a stream has been published in the channel.</li><li>A user whose role is not audience calls the `switchChannel` method. Ensure that the user role is audience before calling the `switchChannel` method.</li> |
| `6`        | The buffer size is insufficient to store the returned data.  |
| `7`        | A method is called before the initialization of `RtcEngine`. Ensure that the `RtcEngine `instance is created and initialized before calling the method. |
| `9`        | Permission to access is not granted. Check whether your app has access to the audio and video device. |
| `10`       | A timeout occurs. Some API calls require the SDK to return the execution result. This error occurs if the SDK takes too long (more than 10 seconds) to return the result. |
| `17`       | The request to join the channel is rejected. Typical causes include:<li>The user is already in the channel and still calls a method (for example, `joinChannel`) to join the channel. Stop calling the method to clear this error.</li><li>The user tries to join a channel during a call test. To join a channel, the call test must be ended by calling `stopEchoTest`.</li> |
| `18`       | The request to leave the channel is rejected. Typical causes include:<li>The user has left the channel but still calls a method (for example, `leaveChannel`) to leave the channel. Stop calling the method to clear this error.</li><li>The user is not in the channel. In this case, no extra operation is needed. </li>|
| `19`       | Resources are already in use.                                |
| `20`       | The request is abandoned by the SDK, possibly because the request has been sent too frequently. |
| `21`       | `RtcEngine` fails to initialize and has crashed because of specific Windows firewall settings. |
| `22`       | The SDK fails to allocate resources because your app uses too many system resources or system resources are insufficient. |
| `101`      | The specified App ID is invalid. Please rejoin the channel with a valid App ID. |
| `102`      | The specified channel name is invalid, possibly because the data types of some parameters are incorrect. Please rejoin the channel with a valid channel name. |
| `103`      | `RtcEngine` fails to get server resources in the specified region. Try another region when initializing `RtcEngine`. |
| `109`      | The current token has expired. Please apply for a new token on the server and call renewToken.<div class="alert note">**Note:** This method is **deprecated** as of v2.4.1. Please use `CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOKEN_EXPIRED(9)` in the` onConnectionStateChanged` callback instead.</div> |
| `110`      | The token is invalid due to one of the following reasons:<li>App Certificate is enabled in Agora Console, but the code still uses App ID for authentication. Once App Certificate is enabled for a project, you must use token-based authentication.</li><li>The uid used to generate the token is not the same as the one used to join the channel.</li><div class="alert note">**Note:** This method is **deprecated** as of v2.4.1. Please use `CONNECTION_CHANGED_INVALID_TOKEN(8) `in the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback instead.</div> |
| `111`      | The network connection is interrupted. This error occurs when the SDK has connected to the server but lost connection for more than 4 seconds. |
| `112`      | The network connection is lost. This error occurs when the connection is interrupted and the SDK cannot reconnect to the server within 10 seconds. |
| `113`      | The user is not in the channel when calling the method.      |
| `114`      | The data size exceeds 1024 bytes when calling the `sendStreamMessage` method. |
| `115`      | The data bitrate exceeds 6 Kbps when calling the `sendStreamMessage` method. |
| `116`      | More than five data streams are created when calling the `createDataStream` method. |
| `117`      | The data stream transmission times out.                      |
| `119`      | Switching roles fails.  <div class="alert note">**Note:** This method is **deprecated** as of v3.7.0. Use `CLIENT_ROLE_CHANGE_FAILED_REASON` in the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback instead. </div>                                     |
| `120`      | Decryption fails. The user may have entered an incorrect password to join the channel. Check the entered password or tell the user to try rejoining the channel. |
| `123`      | The user is banned from the server. This error occurs when the user is kicked out of the channel from the server. |
| `134`      | The user account is invalid, possibly because it contains invalid parameters. |
