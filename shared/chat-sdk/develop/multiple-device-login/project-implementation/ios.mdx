### Get the login ID list of other logged-in devices of the current user

Call `getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform` to get the login ID list of other logged-in devices, and then select the target login ID as the message recipient to send a message to the specified device.

```swift
AgoraChatClient.shared().contactManager?.getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform(completion: { ids, err in
        if err == nil,
            let userId = ids?.first {
            // Select a login ID as the message recipient. Create a text message, content is the message text, conversationId passes the login ID as the message recipient.
            let textMessage = AgoraChatMessage(conversationId: userId, body: .text(content: "hello"), ext: nil)
            AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.send(textMessage, progress: nil, completion: { msg, e in

            })
        }
    })
```

### Get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account

Call `getLoggedInDevicesFromServerWithToken` to get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account from the server by passing in the user ID and user token.

```swift
    AgoraChatClient.shared().getLoggedInDevicesFromServer(withUserId: "userId", token: "token") { deviceConfigs, err in
        if err == nil {

        }
    }
```

### Force the specified account to log out from a single device

Call `kickDeviceWithUserId` and pass in the user ID and user token to force the specified account to log out from a single logged-in device. Before calling this method, obtain the device ID through the `AgoraChatClient#getLoggedInDevicesFromServer` and `AgoraChatDeviceInfo#resource` methods. The logged-out device will receive the `AgoraChatClientDelegate#userAccountDidLoginFromOtherDevice` event.

```swift
AgoraChatClient.shared().getLoggedInDevicesFromServer(withUserId: "userId", token: "token") { deviceConfigs, err in
        if err == nil,
            let resource = deviceConfigs?.first?.resource {
            AgoraChatClient.shared().kickDevice(withUserId: "userId", token: "token", resource: resource) { e in

            }
        }
    }
```

### Force the specified account to log out from all devices

Call `kickAllDevicesWithUserId` and pass in the user ID and user token to force the specified account to log out from all logged-in devices. The logged-out device will receive the `AgoraChatClientDelegate#userAccountDidLoginFromOtherDevice` event.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">You can also use this interface without logging in.</Admonition>

```swift
   AgoraChatClient.shared().kickAllDevices(withUserId: "userId", token: "token") { err in

        }
```

### Get operations on other devices

Let's say that account A logs in on devices A and B at the same time and performs operations on device A. Device B will receive notifications corresponding to these operations.

You need to implement the `AgoraChatMultiDevicesDelegate` class to listen to operations on other devices, and then call the `addMultiDevicesDelegate` method to add multi-device listening.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: AgoraChatMultiDevicesDelegate {
    func multiDevicesContactEventDidReceive(_ aEvent: AgoraChatMultiDevicesEvent, username aUsername: String, ext aExt: String?) {
        switch aEvent {
            //The current user deletes friends on other devices.
        case .contactRemove:
            break
            //The current user accepts friend requests on other devices.
        case .contactAccept:
            break
            //The current user rejects friend requests on other devices.
        case .contactDecline:
            break
            //The current user adds a user to the blocklist on other devices.
        case .contactBan:
            break
            //The current user removes a user from the blocklist on other devices.
        case .contactAllow:
            break
        default:
            break
        }
    }

    func multiDevicesGroupEventDidReceive(_ aEvent: AgoraChatMultiDevicesEvent, groupId aGroupId: String, ext aExt: Any?) {
        switch aEvent {
            //The current user created a group on another device
        case .groupCreate:
            break
        //The current user destroyed a group on another device
        case .groupDestroy:
            break
        //The current user joined a group on another device

        case .groupLeave:

        case .groupApply:
            break
        //The current user accepted a group application on another device
        case .groupApplyAccept:
            break

        case .groupApplyDecline:
            break
        //The current user invited group members on another device
        case .groupInvite:

        case .groupInviteAccept:
            break
        //The current user has rejected the invitation to join the group on other devices
        case .groupInviteDecline:
            break
        //The current user has kicked members out of the group on other devices
        case .groupKick:
            break
        //The current user has added members to the group blocklist on other devices
        case .groupBan:

        case .groupMemberAttributesChanged:
