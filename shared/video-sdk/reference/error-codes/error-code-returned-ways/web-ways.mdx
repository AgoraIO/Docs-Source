- For asynchronous methods, the SDK returns a Promise to notify the result of the asynchronous operation, and the SDK throws the appropriate error code when the Promise is rejected.
- When a synchronous method call fails, the SDK throws an error code directly.
  The SDK may also throw some network related error codes during internal operation.

The SDK's error object `AgoraRTCError` inherits from the browser's [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object. Print out the error code on the console via `AgoraRTCError.code` since directly printing the `AgoraRTCError` object will only show the error message.
