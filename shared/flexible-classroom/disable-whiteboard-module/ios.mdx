In <Vg k="FC" />, the implementation logic of opening and closing the Whiteboard is located in the `CloudClass-iOS/SDKs/AgoraEduUI/Classes/Components/Flat/FcrBoardUIComponent.swift` file. Take the following steps to manage the Whiteboard:

1. Add an observer to monitor widget activity

    ```swift
    // add WidgetActivityObserver
    widgetController.add(self)
    ```

2. When the state of the Whiteboard widget activity changes, `onWidgetActive` or `onWidgetInactive` is called. When the status is `active`, open the Whiteboard by creating a Whiteboard Widget object; when the status is `inactive`, close the Whiteboard by destroying the Whiteboard Widget object as follows:

    ```swift
    extension FcrBoardUIComponent: AgoraWidgetActivityObserver {
        func onWidgetActive(_ widgetId: String) {
            guard widgetId == BoardWidgetId else {
                return
            }

            initWidget()
        }

        func onWidgetInactive(_ widgetId: String) {
            guard widgetId == BoardWidgetId else {
                return
            }

            deinitWidget()
        }
    }
    ```
