Agora Server Gateway can be deployed on your server to transmit audio and video streams to apps developed with Agora’s Voice and Video SDKs. The Server Gateway SDK enables communication between server and app through Agora’s global network (SD-RTN). Server Gateway can be used as a server-side gateway for media processing such as speech-to-text, for first- and third-party extensions, or can act as gateway service for Agora media services such as Media Pull.
