## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
The following figure shows the basic workflow of Chat:

![1655713515869](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1655713515869)

Assume that User A sends a message to User B, but User B goes offline before receiving it. The Chat server pushes a notification to the device of User B via FCM and temporarily stores this message. Once User B comes back online, the Chat SDK pulls the message from the server and pushes the message to User B using persistent connections.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
The Chat SDK allows you to implement the following features:

- Set the push notifications of an app
- Retrieve the push notification setting of an app
- Set the push notifications of a conversation
- Retrieve the push notification settings of one conversation or multiple conversations
- Clear the push notification mode of a conversation
- Set and retrieve the preferred language of push notifications
</PlatformWrapper>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- You have initialized the Chat SDK. For details, see <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>.
- You understand the call frequency limit of the Chat APIs supported by different pricing plans as described in [Limitations](../reference/limitations).

This section includes more versatile push notification features that you can use to implement additional functions if needed.

If the ready-made templates do not meet your requirements, Chat also enables you to customize your push notifications.
