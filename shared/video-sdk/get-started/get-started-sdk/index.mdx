This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic <Vpd k="NAME"/> app using the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you implement to integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

{/*
### Key concepts

- **<Vg k="VSDK"/>**: An SDK developed by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to enable developers to add real-time audio and video interaction to their projects.
- **Channel**: A channel is used to transmit data. Users in the same channel can interact in real time.
- **Host**: A host can publish audio and video in a channel. The host can also subscribe to audio and video published by other hosts.
- **Audience**: A user assigned the audience role may subscribe to audio and video within the channel. However, they are not authorized to publish audio or video content.

For more information, see [Core Concepts](../overview/core-concepts).

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
In a <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> event, hosts stream a video feed to an audience. For example, when a CEO is giving a speech to the company employees, the CEO does not need to see all members of the audience. To represent this in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, when you join as a host, the local feed is started and you see your own video feed. When you join as a member of the audience, you see the host's video feed.
</ProductWrapper>

To start a <Vpd k="NAME" /> session, you implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- **Set the channel profile and role.**
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
- **Set the latency level.**
</ProductWrapper>
- **Retrieve a token**: A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. In this guide, you retrieve your token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To see how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow). 

- **Join a channel**: Call methods to create and join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.
    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
    - **Host publishes local video and audio to the channel**: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. Each host can publish their local video to the channel.

    - **Audience subscribes to video and audio published by the hosts**: Audience members view content published by hosts to the channel.
    </ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
- **Send and receive video and audio**: All users can send to and receive video and audio streams from other users in the channel.
</ProductWrapper>

## Prerequisites
<Prerequisites/>
- The following information from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>:
    - **App ID**: A unique string generated by Agora that identifies your project.
    - **A temporary token**: A dynamic key that authenticates a user when the client joins a channel. Note down the channel name you use to generate the token.
