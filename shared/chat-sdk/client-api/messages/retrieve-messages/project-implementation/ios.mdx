### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```objective-c
pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

Refer to the following code sample:

```objective-c
AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption* option = [[AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption alloc] init];
    [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager fetchMessagesFromServerBy:@"conversationId" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeGroupChat cursor:@"" pageSize:20 option:option completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatMessage *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager pinConversation:@"conversationId" isPinned:YES completionBlock:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```


### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```objc
// pageSize: Number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50].
// cursor: The starting position of the query. If `nil` or `@""` is passed in, the SDK will start querying from the latest pinned session.
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```


### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```objective-c
// Delete messages by timestamp
AgoraChatConversation* conversation = [AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId"];
    [conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:timeToRemove completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
// Delete messages by message ID
 [conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"msgId1",@"msgId2"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

    }];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages  from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```

### Mark conversation

You can call `addConversationMark` the method to mark the session. Up to 20 conversations can be tagged at a time. Calling this method will add tags to both local and server-side sessions.

After adding the session tag, if `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` the interface is called to obtain the session list from the server page, the returned session object will contain the session tag, that is, `EMConversation#marks` the field. If you have reached the server session list length limit (default 100 sessions), the server will delete inactive sessions based on session activity (the timestamp of the latest message), and the session markers of these sessions will also be deleted.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding marks to a conversation, such as conversation stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in the conversation.</Admonition>

```objective-c
[EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager addConversationMark:@[@"conversationId1"] mark:EMMarkType0 completion:^(EMError * _Nullable aError) {}];
```

### Unmark session

You can `removeConversationMark` delete the session token by calling the method. Tags can be removed for up to 20 sessions at a time. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side session tokens.
```objective-c
[EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager removeConversationMark:@[@"conversationId1"] mark:EMMarkType0 completion:^(EMError * _Nullable aError) {
            
    }];
```

### Paginated query of session list from server based on session tag

You can call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor` the method to get a list of sessions paginated from the server based on the session tag. The SDK will return the session list in reverse order of the time of the session mark. Each session object contains the session ID, session type, whether it is pinned, the pin time (for a session that is not pinned, the value is `0`), the session mark, and the latest message. After pulling the session list from the server, the local session list will be updated.

```objective-c
// cursor: The starting position of the query. If an empty string is passed in, the SDK starts fetching conversations from the most recent marked operation.
// filter: Conversation query options, including conversation marks and the number of conversations to fetch per page (up to 10 conversations).
EMConversationFilter *filter = [[EMConversationFilter alloc] initWithMark:EMMarkType0 pageSize:10];
[EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" filter:filter completion:^(EMCursorResult<EMConversation *> * _Nullable result, EMError * _Nullable error) {
            
    }];
```

### Query session list locally based on session tag

For local sessions, you can use the `getAllConversations` method to retrieve all local sessions and then perform session filtering as needed. The following example demonstrates how to query all local sessions marked with `EMMarkType0:`
```objective-c
// All final query results are stored in the 'result' array.
NSMutableArray<EMConversation *> *result = [NSMutableArray array];

// Retrieve all conversations from the local database.
NSArray<EMConversation *> *allConversations = [EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager getAllConversations];

// Iterate through each conversation in 'allConversations'.
for (EMConversation *conversation in allConversations) {
    // Check if the conversation has the 'EMMarkType0' mark.
    if ([conversation.marks containsObject:@(EMMarkType0)]) {
        // Add the conversation to the 'result' array.
        [result addObject:conversation];
    }
}
```

### Get all tags of a local single session

To retrieve all tags associated with a local single session, first use the `getConversationWithConvId` method to obtain the local single session. Then, access the `marks` property of the session object to view all its tags. Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating this process:

```objective-c
EMConversation* conversation = [EMClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationWithConvId:@"conversationId"];
    NSArray<NSNumber*>* marks = conversation.marks;
```
