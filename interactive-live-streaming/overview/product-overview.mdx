Agora’s Interactive Live Streaming allows you to add live video and voice interactive streaming to any online experience. 

Enabled by either Agora’s Video SDK or Voice SDK, Interactive Live Streaming gives you full control over the streaming experience from a standard one-to-many stream to a highly-interactive live event. You can extend the SDK with functionality like analytics and content moderation or explore Extensions Marketplace to quickly activate noise canceling, face filters, and more.
