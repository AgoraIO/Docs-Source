### Get the sample project

You can obtain the sample project using the following methods:

- Go to the [SDKs](/sdks) page, download the latest version of the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK" />, and unzip it.

- Run the following command to clone the Github repository locally:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:AgoraIO/API-Examples.git
    ```

    This repository contains sample projects for all native platforms of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK" />. The API usage examples for macOS are located under `/macOS`.

### Configure the sample project

1. Set your App ID and App certificate

    Open the `KeyCenter.swift` file and fill in the App ID and App certificate you obtained from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

    ```swift
    struct KeyCenter {
        // Replace <#Your App ID#> with your App ID
        static let AppId: String = "<#Your App ID#>"
        // Replace #Your certificate# with your App certificate. Leave this field blank if the project allows joining with the App ID only
        static let Certificate: String? = "<#Your certificate#>"
    }
    ```

1. Open a terminal and run `pod install` in the `/macOS` directory, to install project dependencies. After the installation is complete, the terminal displays `Pod installation complete!`. A file `APIExample.xcworkspace` is generated in the project folder.
