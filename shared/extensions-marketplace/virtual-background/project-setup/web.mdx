Take the following steps to set up your project:

1. Refer to the [SDK Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) guide to integrate the Web SDK v4.15.0 or later into your project and implement the basic real-time communication functions.

1. Integrate the [virtual background extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-extension-virtual-background) into your project via npm:

   1. To install the virtual background extension, run the following command :

      ```bash
      npm install agora-extension-virtual-background
      ```

   1. To import the virtual background extension, use any of the following methods:

      Method one: Add the following code to the JavaScript file:

      ```typescript
      import VirtualBackgroundExtension from "agora-extension-virtual-background";
      ```
