Sending and receiving messages is the most basic function of the Signaling service. Any message sent by the Signaling server can be delivered to any online subscribing user within 100 ms. Depending on your business requirements, you can send messages to one user only or broadcast messages to multiple users.

Signaling offers two types of channels: message channels and stream channels. These channel types have the following differences in how messages are transmitted and methods are called:

- Message Channel: The real-time channel. Messages are transmitted through the channel, and the channel is highly scalable. Local users can call the <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to send messages in the channel, and remote users can call the <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to subscribe to the channel and receive messages.
- Stream Channel: The streaming transmission channel. Messages are transmitted through the topic. Users need to join a channel first, and then join a topic. Local users can call the <code>{topic.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to send messages in the topic, and remote users can call the <code>{topic.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to subscribe to the topic and receive messages.

This page introduces how to send and receive messages in a Message Channel.

### {message.publish[props.ag_platform]}

#### Description

You can directly call the <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to send messages to all online users who subscribe to the channel. Even if you do not subscribe to a channel, you can still send messages in the channel.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">The following practices can effectively improve the reliability of message transmission:<ul><li>The message payload should be within 32 KB; otherwise, the sending will fail.</li><li>The upper limit of the rate at which messages are sent to a single channel is 30 QPS. If the sending rate exceeds the limit, some messages will be discarded. A lower rate is better, as long as the requirements are met.</li><li>Signaling does not guarantee that the order in which all subscribers receive messages is the same as the order in which the sender sends messages. To ensure that messages are strictly ordered, Agora suggests that you customize the message sequence number in the message payload.</li></ul></Admonition>

After successfully calling this method, the SDK triggers a <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. Users who subscribe to the channel and enabled the event listener can receive this event notification. For details, see <a href="../toc-configuration/configuration#Event-Listener">Event Listener</a>.

#### Method

You can call the <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> method in the following way:

```javascript
rtm.publish(
    channelName: string,
    message: string | Uint8Array,
    options?: {customType?: string;}
): Promise<PublishResponse>;
```

|   Parameter   |       Type        | Required | Default | Description                                                  |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `message`   | string \| Uint8Array | Required |    -    | The message payload. Supports string or Uint8Array type. |
| `channelName` |      string       | Required |    -    | The channel name. You can only send messages to one channel at a time. |
|   `options`   |      object       | Optional |    -    | The message options.                                         |

The `options` object includes the following property:

|  Property   |  Type  | Required | Default | Description                                      |
| :----------: | :----: | :------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `customType` | string | Optional |    -    | A user-defined field. Only supports string type. |

#### Basic usage

Example 1: Send string messages to a specified channel.

```javascript 
try {
    const result = await rtm.publish( 'my_channel', "Hello world" );
    console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
    console.log(status);
}
```

Example 2: Send Uint8Array messages to a specified channel.

```javascript 
const str2ab = function(str) {
    var buf = new ArrayBuffer(str.length * 2); // Each character occupies 2 bytes.
    var bufView = new Uint16Array(buf);
    for (var i = 0, strLen = str.length; i < strLen; i++) {
        bufView[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return buf;
};
var Message=str2ab('hello world');
try {
    const result = await rtm.publish('my_channel', Message );
    console.log(result);
} catch (status) {
    console.log(status);
}
```

#### Return value

If the method call succeeds, the <code>{message.publishresulttype[props.ag_platform]}</code> response as follows is returned:

```js 
type PublishResponse = {
    timeToken: number ,              // Reserved property, indicating the timestamp of the successful operation.
    chanelName : string              // Channel name.
}
```

If the method call fails, an [`ErrorInfo`](#errorinfo) response is returned.

### Receive

Signaling provides event notifications for messages, states, and event changes. By setting event listeners, you can receive messages and events in subscribed channels.
