This page introduces the billing policy for the use of <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

<Admonition type="info">
Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.
</Admonition>

When you use <Vpd k="NAME" /> in your project, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> charges a fee in your monthly bill. See [Billing](/voice-calling/reference/billing-policies#billing) for details. At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates the total usage of <Vpd k="NAME" /> across all projects under your developer account, subtracts the free quota, and multiplies the remaining usage by the corresponding unit price to calculate the total cost. The final amount is rounded to two decimal places.

## Unit price

Calling the server API to create an <Vpd k="NAME" /> instance, which then joins the channel, incurs an audio task fee at the following rate:

| Usage Type	| Pricing (USD / minute) |	Free Minutes  |
|:--------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------|
| <Vpd k="NAME"/> Audio Task | 0.0265	 | First 300 minutes are free |

<Admonition type="info">
The unit price includes the following:
- Real-time Speech-To-Text (STT).
- The audio RTC subscription fee of the engine instance.
</Admonition>

## Example

User A joins a channel and starts a voice conversation with an instance created by <Vpd k="NAME" />. The interaction lasts for 10 minutes. User A and the <Vpd k="NAME"/> instance exit the channel at the same time. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates the cost for this session as follows:
