This section shows how to implement managing messages.

### Retrieve conversations

Call `LoadAllConversations` to retrieve all the conversations on the local device:

```csharp
List<Conversation>list = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.LoadAllConversations();
```

### Retrieve messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code sample to retrieve the messages in the specified conversation:

```csharp
// Get the specified conversation on the local device.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
// Call LoadMessages to retrieve messages by specifying the `startMsgId` and `pageSize`.
conv.LoadMessages(startMsgId, pagesize, callback:new ValueCallBack<List<Message>>(
  onSuccess: (list) => {
     Debug.Log($"{list.Count} Messages retrieved.");
  },
  onError:(code, desc) => {
     Debug.Log($"Fails to retrieve the message, errCode={code}, errDesc={desc}");
  }
));
```

### Retrieve the count of unread messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of unread messages:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
int unread = conv.UnReadCount;
```

### Retrieve the count of unread messages in all conversations

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of all unread messages:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetUnreadMessageCount();
```

### Mark unread messages as read

Refer to the following code example to mark the specified messages as read:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
// Mark all the messages in the current conversation as read.
conv.MarkAllMessageAsRead();
// Mark the specified message as read.
conv.MarkMessageAsRead(msgId);
// Mark all unread messages as read.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.MarkAllConversationsAsRead();
```

### Clear chat history

To clear the current user's chat history, including messages and conversations in individual chats, group chats, and chat rooms, you can call the `DeleteAllMessagesAndConversations` method. Additionally, you can choose whether to clear the chat history on the server. Note that clearing the chat history on the server means that you will not be able to retrieve conversations and messages from the server, although other users will not be affected.

```csharp
bool clearServerData = false; // or true
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteAllMessagesAndConversations(clearServerData, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Delete conversations and historical messages

You can delete conversations on both the local device and the server.

To delete them on the local device, call `DeleteConversation` and `DeleteMessage`:

```csharp
// Call DeleteConversation to delete the specified conversation. 
// `true` indicates to keep the historical messages while deleting the conversation. To remove the historical messages as well, set it as `false`.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversation(conversationId, true);
// Delete the specified message in the current conversation.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
conv.DeleteMessage(msgId);
```

To delete conversations on the server, call `DeleteConversationFromServer`:

```csharp
// Delete a conversation on the server. If you want to keep the historical messages, pass “false” to the third parameter.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversationFromServer(conversationId, type, true, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

### Delete all messages in the local conversation

You can delete all messages in the local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversionId, conversationType);

```csharp
if (conv.DeleteAllMessages()){
     // Message deleted successfully
}
else {
     // Delete message failed
}
```

### Delete messages from a single local conversation within a specified time period

You can delete local messages for a specified conversation within a period of time. The sample code is as follows:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversionId, conversationType);

if (conv.DeleteMessages(startTime, endTime)) {
     // Message deleted successfully
}
else {
     // Delete message failed
}
```

### Delete the specified message of a local conversation

You can delete specified messages of a single local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversionId, conversationType);

if (conv.DeleteMessage(msgid)){
     // Message deleted successfully
}
else {
     // Delete message failed
}
```

### Search for messages using keywords

Search methods provided on this page can be used to search the local database for all types of messages except command messages, because command messages are not stored in the local database.

Call `SearchMsgFromDB` to search for messages by keywords, timestamp, and message sender:

```csharp
List<Message> list = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.SearchMsgFromDB(keywords, timeStamp, maxCount, from, MessageSearchDirection.UP);
```

### Search for messages in all conversations based on search scope

You can call the `ChatManager#SearchMsgFromDB(string, long, in, string, MessageSearchDirection, MessageSearchScope, ValueCallBack<List<Message>>)` method to search in all conversations based on the search scope. This means that, in addition to setting the keywords, message timestamps, number of messages, sender, and search direction, you can also choose to search only in the message content, only in the message extension information, or in both.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.SearchMsgFromDB("keywords", -1, 10, "from", MessageSearchDirection.UP, MessageSearchScope.CONTENT, new ValueCallBack<List<Message>>(
  onSuccess: (list) => {
      foreach (var it in list)
      {
          //Iterate over the List<Message> list
      }
  },
  onError: (code, desc) => {
}));
```

### Search for messages in the current conversation based on search scope

You can call `Conversation#LoadMessagesWithScope(string, MessageSearchScope, long, int, string, MessageSearchDirection, ValueCallBack<List<Message>>)` method to search for messages in the current conversation based on the search scope. This means that, in addition to setting keywords, message timestamps, number of messages, sender, direction, and other parameters, you can also choose to search only in the message content, only in the message extension information, or in both.

```csharp
conv.LoadMessagesWithScope("keywords", MessageSearchScope.CONTENT, -1, 10, "from", MessageSearchDirection.UP, new ValueCallBack<List<Message>>(
    onSuccess: (list) => {
        foreach (var it in list)
        {
            //Iterate over the List<Message> list
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```


### Import messages

Call `ImportMessages` to import multiple messages to the specified conversation. This applies to scenarios where chat users want to formard messages from another conversation.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.ImportMessages(messages, new CallBack(
  onSuccess: () => {
  },
  onError: (code, desc) =>
  {
  }
));
```

### Insert messages

If you want to insert a message to the current conversation without actually sending the message, construct the message body and call `InsertMessage`. This can be used to send notification messages such as "XXX recalls a message", "XXX joins the chat group", and "Typing ...".

```csharp
// Insert the message to the current conversation.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
conv.InsertMessage(message);
```
