To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, set the `areaCode` property of config to specify a region for geofencing.

In `ViewController`, locate the `initializeAgoraEngine` method and add the following code after `config.appId = appId;`:

```swift
// Your app will only connect to Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
config.areaCode = AgoraAreaCodeType.NA
```

If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vg k="VSDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

* Whitelist certain domains
* Allow all IP addresses
* Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to= "{{global.AGORA_DOCS_URL}}/{{platform.NAME}}/cloudproxy_native?platform={{platform.NAME}}">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>.
