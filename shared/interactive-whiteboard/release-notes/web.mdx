## v2.15.16

v2.15.16 was released on January 21, 2022.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Optimizes the logic of `disconnect` and `setWritable` to ensure that the SDK returns a `Promise` object only when all requests sent before the `disconnect()` or `setWritable(false)` method call are executed.
- Optimizes the UI of the text editing floating bar (`floatBar`), and saves the text format set by users on the floating bar.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- The error code returned when joining a room failed was inaccurate.
- After rejoining a room, `room.state.memberState` returned the initial state of the room, rather than the current state.
- The console reported an error after a successful reconnection.
- `room.state.memberState` occasionally returned `undefined`.
- The button on the text editing floating bar (`floatBar`) sometimes did not work or disappeared.
- The whiteboard room went blank and tried a reconnection.
- The user received the event notification multiple times after calling `dispatchMagixEvent` to send an event.
- File conversion failed because the background fill property was not set in the source PPT file.
- The `canvas` rendering engine occasionally crashed.
- The CPU usage of the `canvas` rendering was occasionally high.
- On some iOS or Android devices, grids occasionally appeared on the whiteboard.

## v2.15.1

v2.15.1 was released on November 16, 2021, which fixed the following issues with displaying dynamic PPT files in the whiteboard:

- When there are bugs with the animation effects in a slide master, slides based on that slide master could not be switched.
- Some clickable elements did not take effect when clicked.

## v2.15.2

v2.15.2 was released on November 19, 2021.

#### New features

**1. Disables/Enables the frequency limit for writing synchronization**

This release adds the `disablePencilWrittingLimitFrequency` property in `JoinRoomParams`, for disabling or enabling the frequency limit for synchronizing the writing input while using the `pencil` tool.

**2.** **Options for setting a custom event listener**

This release adds the `options` parameter in `addMagixEventListener` as well as the `MagixEventListenerOptions` type, for setting the following options for a custom event listener:

- `fireInterval`: The interval (ms) of the SDK triggering custom event callbacks.
- `fireSelfEventAfterCommit`: Whether to send event callbacks after the Agora server acknowledges the `dispatchMagixEvent` method call is successful.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the rendering crashes after initializing the room or adjusting the order of components in the scene under certain circumstances.

#### API changes

**Added**

- The `disablePencilWrittingLimitFrequency` property in [`JoinRoomParams`](./API%20Reference/whiteboard_web/globals.html#joinroomparams)
- The `options` parameter in [`addMagixEventListener`](./API%20Reference/whiteboard_web/interfaces/displayer.html#addmagixeventlistener)
- [`MagixEventListenerOptions`](./API%20Reference/whiteboard_web/globals.html#magixeventlisteneroptions)

## v2.15.0

v2.15.0 was released on November 16, 2021.

#### Compatibility changes

To help you manage users in a room, this release adds the `uid` property in `JoinRoomParams`, for setting the unique identifier of a user.

If you upgrade the SDK to v2.15.0 or later, to avoid affecting your service, ensure that you pass in a string `uid` in `JoinRoomParams` when calling `joinRoom`. The `uid` of each user cannot be longer than 1024 bytes and must be unique in the same room. For more information, see [Join a Whiteboard Room](https://docs.agora.io/en/whiteboard/join_whiteboard_room_web?platform=Web#join-the-whiteboard-room-from-your-app-client).

#### New features

**1. Disables/Enables the frequency limit for sending custom events**

This release adds the `disableMagixEventDispatchLimit` property in `JoinRoomParams`, for disabling or enabling the frequency limit for sending custom events.

**2. File conversion optimizations**

This release adds support for converting and displaying the following PowerPoint (PPT) features:

- Action buttons
- Slide masters added with animation effects.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- The writing experience is optimized further.
- To improve the user experience, the SDK sets `uniformScale` in `ImageInformation` as `true` by default when the `insertImage` method is called. This ensures the image is scaled based on its original aspect ratio when a user adjusts its size. If you do not want the image to be scaled proportionately, you can set `uniformScale` as `false`.

#### Fixed issues

This release has fixed the following issues:

- The room state became incorrect when you called `setWritable(false)` at the time of joining the room.
- Multiple copies could appear when you pasted copied content.
- Each property sometimes appeared twice when you read `room.state.roomMembers`.
- The following issues with displaying dynamic PPT files in the whiteboard were fixed:
  - The images were occasionally displaced.
  - Failure to read certain styles caused the screen to go blank.
  - The rotation angle and color were incorrect for some text.
  - Occasionally, elements with an animation effect were not displayed
  - The animation of some text was displayed incorrectly.

#### API changes

**Added**

- The following properties in [`JoinRoomParams`](./API%20Reference/whiteboard_web/globals.html#joinroomparams):

  - `uid`
  - `disableMagixEventDispatchLimit`

**Modified**

- [`seekToProgressTime`](./API%20Reference/whiteboard_web/interfaces/player.html#seektoprogresstime)

**Deleted**

- The `pencilOptions` property in `MemberState`
- The `broadcasterInformation` property in `BroadcastState`
- The `zoomScale` property in `RoomState`
- The `scheduleTime` property in `Player`
- The `seekToScheduleTime` method in `Player`

## v2.14.5

- `importScene`: Imports the contents of a scene exported by using `exportScene` into a specified scene directory.

**2. Scene path type**

This release adds the `conflict` enumerator in `ScenePathType`, which indicates that a path cannot exist because it contains the path of an existing scene.

**3. Locking images**

To support locking or unlocking selected images, this release adds the `lockImages` method. When an image is locked, the user cannot move, zoom, or delete the image.

**4. Adjusting font size**

This release adds the `updateTextFontSize` method for adjusting the size of the text entered with the `text` tool.

**5. Adjusting component layers**

To support adjusting the layers of components, this release adds the following methods:
