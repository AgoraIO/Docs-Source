    6.  Test processing of raw video data.

        Press **Zoom In**. You see that the local video captured by your device camera is cropped and scaled to give a zoom-in effect. The processed video is displayed both locally and remotely. Pressing the button again stops processing of raw video data and restores the original video.

    7.  Test processing of raw audio data.

        Edit the `iAudioFrameObserver` definition by adding code that processes the raw audio data you receive in the following callbacks:

        -   `onRecordAudioFrame`: Gets the captured audio frame data

        -   `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: Gets the audio frame for playback

        -   `onMixedAudioFrame`: Retrieves the mixed captured frame for playback audio frame
