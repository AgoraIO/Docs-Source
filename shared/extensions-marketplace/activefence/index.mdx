## Project Setup

In order to configure <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />:

1. **Setup your <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> account**

    1. In your browser, navigate to https://www.activefence.com/demo/ and request a demo account.

        <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sets up your demo account and supplies the URL to your <Vg k="RTEE_AF_D" />.

    1. In your browser, log into <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> Dashboard, then click the Settings icon on the top-right.

        **Account Settings** opens.

    1. Click **Data Management** > **<Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> API Keys**, then click **Add Key**.

    1. In **Add API Key**, fill in the form and click **Generate Key**.

    1. Click **Data Management** > **API Management** > **Key Management**, then click **Add Key**.

    1. In **Add API Key**, fill in the \<I DONT KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE FILLED IN HERE, is it the API Key?> and press
   **Save**.

1. **Define the information <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends to your webhook**

    <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> monitors the data sent in a channel. When anything matches your filters, <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />
   sends a PUSH request to your webhook with information about the channel the data was sent and the user who sent
   it. To enable this, you configure the data that is sent to your webhook:

    1. In <Vg k="RTEE_AF" />, click **MODERATION CAPABILITIES** > **Custom Fields**.

    1. Add the following editable custom fields:

        | Title      | Key | Type | Tooltip |
        | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
        |  cname    |   cname    |  Text     |  The name of the channel being monitored.     |
        |  requestId    | requestId      |  Text     |   The Id of the request used to upload an image.    |
        |  sid    |  sid     |  Text     |    The SID uploaded by Video SDK. (I don't understand what this is)   |
        |  source    |  source     |  Text     |   This value is hardcoded as `agora`.   |
        |    timestamp  |  timestamp     |  Number     | The time the image was uploaded in the format; YYYY MM DD HH MM SS SSS |
        |  uid  | uid      |  Number     |   The ID of the user who sent the message to the channel.    |

1. **Define the webhook <Vg k="RTEE_AF" /> sends information to**

    1. In **Add Action Webhook**, update the following fields and click **Save**.

        - **Action** - The name for this webhook.
        - **Related Entity** - Set to `content`.

        - **Request Method** - Set to POST.
        - **API Key** - For authenticated requests to your webhook. Choose the key you configured earlier.   If you
        do not require authentication, set to No auth.


    1. In **Body**, configure the format of the JSON object and data sent to your webhook. Set the following:

        ```json

    I can't see where to start from the Configure workflows section in https://confluence.agoralab.co/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1289749231.

## Integrate the extension


In order to enable content moderation in your app, update your `joinChannel` method with the following code:

```objc
let connection = AgoraRtcConnection()
 connection.localUid = userId
 connection.channelId = roomName

agoraEngine.joinChannelEx(byToken: nil, connection: connection, delegate: nil, mediaOptions: mediaOptions, joinSuccess: nil)


let inspectExtraConfig = AgoraContentInspectConfig()
var modules = [AgoraContentInspectModule]()
let module1 = AgoraContentInspectModule()
module1.type = .imagemoderation  // Be sure to set type as cloudmoderation
module1.interval = 2       // Set content moderation to run every 2 seconds
modules.append(module1)
inspectExtraConfig.modules = modules
agoraEngine.enableContentInspectEx(true, config: config, connection: connection)


//IAIN, don't understand why we are doing this again. Is this for another user?
let connection = AgoraRtcConnection()
 connection.localUid = userId
 connection.channelId = roomName

agoraEngine.enableContentInspectEx(enabled, config: config, connection: connection)
```
