## Authentication

The <Vg k="MESS" /> RESTful API only supports HTTPS. To authenticate your request, refer to the [RESTful API authentication](restful-authentication) guidelines.

## API overview
Using <Vg k="MESS" /> RESTful API, you can get information regarding:

- [User events](#get-user-events)
- [Channel events](#get-channel-events)

## Data format

All requests are sent to the host `api.agora.io`. See [Ensure service reliability](#ensure-service-reliability) for alternate domain names.

- Request: Refer to the examples in the following APIs.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.
- Base URL: `https://api.agora.io/dev/v2/project/<appid>`  
    where `<appid>` is the Agora [app ID](/signaling/reference/glossary#app-id) for your project. 
<Admonition>
All the request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.
</Admonition>

## Get user events

This method gets the user events from the address specified by the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> server. Events you acquire using this API are removed from the server. You cannot retrieve the same event twice.

<Admonition>
- The number of requests for each app ID must not exceed 10 per second.
- The <Vg k="MESS" /> backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events. If the number of events exceeds 2,000, the latest event replaces the oldest event.
- The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time.
- Agora does not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographical regions (countries or continents), because events are stored by geographical regions.
- If you pull events from one geographical region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different geographical region. This is because Agora only synchronizes events within a geographical region and not across geographical regions.
</Admonition>
