### Development considerations

When using the recording and playback features, note the following:

* **Fastboard does not provide a replay API**: The Fastboard iOS SDK focuses on the rapid creation and management of real-time interactive whiteboard rooms. The playback function requires direct use of the underlying Whiteboard SDK.
* **Access the underlying SDK**: Access the underlying Whiteboard SDK through the `FastRoom` object's `whiteSDK` property to implement the playback function.
* **Recording delay**: Recording content is not generated in real time. Newly created rooms may need to wait for a period of time before the recording content becomes available.
* **Time range**: Set an appropriate playback time range based on your usage scenario to avoid playing unnecessary content.
* **Network buffering**: Playback may require network buffering, especially when seeking to a distant point in time.
* **m3u8 format**: Audio and video in m3u8 format may require waiting for the initial `combinePlayerEndBuffering` call before `seek` can be performed.
* **State synchronization**: When using `WhiteCombinePlayer`, you must call `updateWhitePlayerPhase` in the `phaseChanged` callback. Otherwise, state cannot be synchronized correctly.
* **Resource release**: Remember to call `player.stop()` to release player resources after use.
