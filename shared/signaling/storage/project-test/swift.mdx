1. Create an <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance for the first user:

    1. In `ViewController`, update the value of `token` with a valid RTM token for user ID `userA`. To obtain an RTM token, see [Secure authentication with tokens](./authentication-workflow).

    1. Connect a physical <Vpl k="NAME" /> device to your development device.

    1. In Xcode, click **Run app**. A moment later you see the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> installed on your device.

1. Create an <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance for the second user:

    1. In `ViewController`, update the value of `token` with a valid RTM token for user ID `userB`.

    1. Run the modified app on a device emulator or a second physical <Vpl k="NAME" /> device.

1. On each device, enter the user ID corresponding to the RTM token, and tap **Login** to connect to <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />.

1. On each device, enter the channel name `demo` and tap **Join** to connect to the same <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> channel. You see both users in the user list on each device.

1. In the user list on either device, select the user ID of a remote user. You see a toast message showing metadata for that user.

1. On either device, tap the button to change the status of the local user from **Available** to **Busy**. You see that the status icon for the user is updated on the remote device.

1. Tap **Leave** to exit the channel and then **Logout**  of <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />.
