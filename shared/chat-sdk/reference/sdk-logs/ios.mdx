By default, the SDK generates three log files, `easemob.log` and two `easemob_Y-m-d_H-M-S.log` files, each with a maximum size of 2048 KB (2 MB). These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest logs in `easemob.log`. When `easemob.log` is full, the SDK renames it to the name of the current time-dependent log file. If there are more than three log files, the SDK deletes the earliest log file, and creates a new `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

For example, the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record logs at 8:00:00 a.m. on January 1, 2024. If this file is completely written at 8:30:00 a.m., the SDK renames it `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log`. At 9:30:00 a.m. and 10:30:30 a.m., the SDK generates `easemob_2024-01-01_09-30-30.log` and `easemob_2024-01-01_10-30-30.log`. At this time, `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log` will be removed before the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

`AgoraChatOptions#AgoraChatLogLevel` specifies the log level for output.

- (default) `AgoraChatLogLevelDebug`: All logs;
- `AgoraChatLogLevelWarning`: Warnings and errors.
- `AgoraChatLogLevelError`: Errors.

If you want to output SDK logs on the XCode console, you can enable log output during SDK initialization.

```objective-c
AgoraChatOptions* option = [AgoraChatOptions optionsWithAppkey:@"<#appkey#>"];
// Output logs on the XCode console
option.enableConsoleLog = YES;
// Set the log level. The default value is `AgoraChatLogLevelDebug`, indicating all logs are output.
option.logLevel = AgoraChatLogLevelDebug;
[ChatClient.sharedClient initializeSDKWithOptions:option];
```
## Collect SDK logs

Here, a simulator is used as an example.
To access SDK logs, take the following steps:
1. Copy the app sandbox path printed by `NSHomeDirectory()`.
2. In the Finder on your Mac system, select **Go > Go to Folder**.
3. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste the path and press **Return**.
4. Open the logs directory `{app sandbox path}/Library/Application Support/HyphenateSDK/easemobLog/` which contains the SDK logs.
