## Develop a video extension

This section introduces the APIs you must implement in order to develop a video extension. Optionally, based on the actual needs, you can implement certain auxiliary APIs to optimize the design and performance of your extension. For details, refer to [See also](#ref).








## See also<a name="ref"></a>

This section describes the auxiliary APIs for developing a video extension.

### VideoProcessor

#### name

```
name: string;
```

The name of the` Processor`.

#### enabled

```
enabled :boolean;
```

Whether the` Processor` is enabled.

#### ID

```
public readonly ID:string;
```

The identifier of the` Processor`.

#### kind

```
public get Kind():'video' | 'audio';
```

The type of the ` Processor`, which is categorized as video or audio.

#### context

```
protected context?: IProcessorContext;
```

This property allows the `Processor` to request and recapture the original media stream.

#### onPiped

```
abstract onPiped?(context: IProcessorContext): void;
```

Reports that a `LocalVideoTrack` connects to the current media processing pipeline.

**Note**: This callback is not triggered if only `Processor`s are connected``. For example: The app client calls `processorA.pipe(processorB)`.

#### onUnpiped

```
abstract onUnPiped?(): void;
```

Reports that the `Processor` disconnects from the media processing pipeline.

#### onEnableChange

```
abstract onEnableChange?(enabled: boolean): void | Promise<void>;
```

Reports that the `Processor` is enabled or disabled.

#### inputTrack

```
protected inputTrack?:MediaStreamTrack;
```

Video received by the extension from the previous `Processor` or `LocalVideoTrack`.

#### outputTrack

```
protected outputTrack?:MediaStreamTrack;
```

Video output by the `Processor`. Calling the `output` method automatically sets the `outputTrack` property.

### Ticker

#### constructor

```typescript
public constructor(type:"Timer" | "RAF" | "Oscillator", interval: number):Ticker;
```

The constructor of the ` Ticker` class.

**Parameters**

- `type`: The following types are supported:
   - `Timer`: Using `setTimeout` as the internal ` timer` of the extension.
   - (Recommended) `RAF`: Using `requestAnimationFrame` as the internal timer of the extension. In most cases, this type of `Ticker` has the best rendering performance.
   - `Oscillator`: Using `Web Audio's ``OscillatorNode` as the internal timer of the extension. This type of `Ticker` keeps running when the browser page is not being viewed.
- `interval`: The `interval `between two recurring callbacks.  The `Ticker` tries its best to execute at this interval, but might not be 100% accurate.

#### Ticker.add

```typescript
public add(fn: Function): void;
```

Adds a timer task.

#### Ticker.remove

```typescript
public remove():void;
```

Removes the added timer task.

#### Ticker.start

```typescript
public start():void;
```

Starts the timer.

#### Ticker.stop

```typescript
public stop():void;
```

Stops the timer.

### Logger

```
interface IExtensionLogger {
    debug(...args: any): void;
    error(...args: any): void;
    info(...args: any): void;
    warning(...args: any): void;
}
```

This class provides four levels of logs.

If the app client chooses to upload the logs when calling `AgoraRTC.registerExtension`, the status of the extension that implements the `Logger` class is updated.

### Reporter

#### Reporter.reportApiInvoke

```typescript
public reportApiInvoke<T>(params: ReportApiInvokeParams): AgoraApiExecutor<T>;
```

Reports events related to API calls to the SDK.

The definitions of `ReportApiInvokeParams` and `AgoraApiExecutor` are as follows:

```typescript
interface ReportApiInvokeParams {
    // The API name
    name: string;
    // Parameters or options related to the API
    options: any;
    // Whether to report the result of the API call
    reportResult?: boolean;
    // How long is counted as timeout for the API call
    timeout?: number;
}
interface AgoraApiExecutor<T> {
    // The API call succeeds
    onSuccess: (result: T) => void;
    // The API call fails
    onError: (err: Error) => void;
}
```
