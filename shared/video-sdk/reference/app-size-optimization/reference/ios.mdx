#### PVC insert

PVC (Perceptual Video Coding) is a video coding method that reduces bandwidth consumption while ensuring the same image quality. Use it to improve video fluency in scenarios with limited bandwidth, and reduce traffic consumption in mobile network scenarios. If you need to use this function, please contact [technical support](support@agora.io).
