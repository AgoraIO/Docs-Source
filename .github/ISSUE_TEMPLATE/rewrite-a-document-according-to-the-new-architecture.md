<!-- This Issue is for Agora use only -->

**Business case**: The POC3 reference app simplifies the integration process of Video SDK. Clients can simply clone the code repository to experience and test product features. Add code for the implementation of **Document title** to the `video-sdk-samples-<platform>` code repository. Update the document to POC3 style and include the updated code. Use conditional blocks, where required, to create variants for Interactive live streaming, Broadcast Streaming, and Voice calling
