### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `fetchConversationsByOptions` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `loadAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchConversationsByOptions(
      options: ConversationFetchOptions(),
    );
```

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

After retrieving conversations, you can retrieve historical messages from the server.

You can set the search direction to retrieve messages in the chronological or reverse chronological order of when the server receives them, the message type, the time period, the message sender, as well as whether to save the retrieved message to the local database.

If you have integrated Chat SDK after June 8, 2023, you can retrieve historical messages even before joining the Chat Group. For earlier implementations, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable this.

The Agora Chat server stores the full message history for a certain period of time depending on your subscribed [Chat plan](../../reference/message-overview#limitations-of-message-storage-duration). After an end user logs back into Agora Chat, the servers  automatically send offline messages to them, that is, messages transmitted when that end user was offline. Offline messages are a subset of the full message history stored on Agora Chat server. Sending only a subset of messages prevents distributing too many messages to a single device, which can overwhelm it and slow down the end user login. Agora Chat server stores and manages these offline messages for every end user in the following way:

- 1:1 private chat: Store 500 offline messages by default;
- Chat Group: Store 200 offline messages by default;
- Chatroom: Doesn't store offline messages. However, whenever an end user joins a chatroom, Agora Chat servers push the 10 latest messages/chatroom to them, by default. This number can be adjusted to 200 messages/chatroom without additional charges.

For users to receive more offline messages, use the client API or a webhook to sync with Agora Chat's server. End users can also store additional messages on their local database.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend retrieving less than 50 historical messages for each method call. To retrieve more than 50 historical messages, call this method multiple times. Once the messages are retrieved, the SDK automatically updates these messages in the local database.

Refer to the following code sample:

```dart
ChatConversationType conversationType = ChatConversationType.Chat;
FetchMessageOptions options = FetchMessageOptions(
  from: senderId,
  direction: ChatSearchDirection.Up,
  startTs: 1695720454000,
  endTs: 1695720554000,
  needSave: false,
);

ChatCursorResult<ChatMessage> result =
    await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchHistoryMessagesByOption(
  conversationId,
  conversationType,
  options: options,
  cursor: cursor,
  pageSize: pageSize,
);
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.pinConversation(
  conversationId: conversationId,
  isPinned: isPinned,
);
```


### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```dart
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchConversationsByOptions(
      options: ConversationFetchOptions.pinned(),
    );
```

### Pin a message

You can call `ChatManager#pinMessage` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `ChatEventHandler#onMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatEventHandler#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `MessagePinInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.pinMessage(messageId: msgId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('pinMessage error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Unpin a message

You can call `ChatManager#unpinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `ChatEventHandler#onMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatEventHandler#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, `Message#pinnedInfo` is returned empty and the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```dart
  try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.unpinMessage(messageId: msgId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('unpinMessage error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `ChatManager#fetchPinnedMessages` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

```dart
try {
  List<ChatMessage> pinnedMessages = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchPinnedMessages(
    conversationId: conversationId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('fetchPinnedMessages error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Get pinned details of a single message

You can call `MessagePinInfo` to get the pinned details of a single message.

- If the message is pinned, this class returns the time of pinning and the user ID of the user who has pinned it.
- If the message is not pinned, this class is returned empty.

```dart
try {
  MessagePinInfo? pinInfo = await message.pinInfo();
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('pinInfo error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteRemoteMessagesBefore` or `deleteRemoteMessagesWithIds` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```dart
try {
  // Delete messages by timestamp
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.deleteRemoteMessagesBefore(
    conversationId: conversationId,
    type: convType,
    timestamp: timestamp,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
try {
  // Delete messages by message ID
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.deleteRemoteMessagesWithIds(
    conversationId: conversationId,
    type: convType,
    msgIds: msgIds,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteRemoteConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.deleteRemoteConversation(
    conversationId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. You can tag up to 20 conversations at a time.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `fetchConversationsByOptions` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `marks` property.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```dart
try {
  await EMClient.getInstance.chatManager.addRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark(
    conversationIds: conversationsIds,
    mark: ConversationMarkType.Type0,
  );
} on EMError catch (e) {
  debugPrint("addRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark error: ${e.code}, ${e.description}");
}

```

### Remove conversation tag

You can call `deleteRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark` to remove tag of a conversation. Tags can be removed for up to 20 conversations at a time. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side tags.

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.deleteRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark(
    conversationIds: conversationIds,
    mark: ConversationMarkType.Type0,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('deleteRemoteAndLocalConversationsMark error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `fetchConversationsByOptions` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```dart
try {
  ChatCursorResult<ChatConversation> result = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.fetchConversationsByOptions(
    options: ConversationFetchOptions.mark(
      ConversationMarkType.Type0,
    ),
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('fetchConversationsByOptions error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Query local conversations by the conversation tag

For local conversations, you can call the `getAllConversations` method to obtain all local conversations and then perform conversation filtering yourself. The following is an example of querying all local conversations marked with `EMConversation.EMMarkType.MARK_0`:

```dart
try {
  List<ChatConversation> markedConversations = [];
  List<ChatConversation> conversations = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.loadAllConversations();
  for (var conversation in conversations) {
    if (conversation.marks?.contains(ConversationMarkType.Type0) == true) {
      markedConversations.add(conversation);
    }
  }
  debugPrint('marked conversations: $markedConversations');
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('get marks conversations error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```

### Get all tags of a local conversation

You can call `Conversation#marks` to get all the tags of a local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```dart
try {
  ChatConversation? conversation = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.getConversation(targetId);
  List<ConversationMarkType>? markType = conversation?.marks;
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('get marks error: ${e.code} ${e.description}');
}
```
