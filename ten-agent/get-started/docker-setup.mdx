This guide shows you how to develop <Vpd k="NAME" /> using VSCode inside a Docker container. 

## Understand the tech

Using VSCode inside a Docker container provides the following advantages:

- Full access to all environment dependencies and build tools
- Direct integration with container-specific headers and libraries
- Automatic path resolution for all project configurations
- Consistent development environment across all team members
- Isolated workspace that matches production settings

VSCode's **Docker** and **Dev Containers** extensions enable seamless development by running your editor inside the container environment, ensuring complete access to all dependencies and build tools.

## Prerequisites

Install the following VSCode extensions:

- [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker): Allows you to manage Docker containers.

- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers): Enables VSCode to connect to Docker containers for development.

## Container setup

### Start the development container

1. Navigate to your TEN Agent project directory

2. Start containers in detached mode:

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```
1. Open VSCode and switch to the Docker extension tab

1. Verify the `ten_agent_dev` container is running

### Connect VSCode to the container

1. In the Docker extension, locate `ten_agent_dev`
1. Right-click and select **Attach Visual Studio Code** to connect to the container
1. A new VSCode window opens, connected to the container

    The container environment starts fresh without your local VSCode extensions or settings. 

1. Install required extensions inside the container:
    1. Click **Extensions** in the left sidebar
    1. Search for extensions you need to develop in Python, Go, or C++
    1. Configure any additional settings
    1. Click **Install in Container** for each extension and follow any additional prompts to complete installation
    1. Configure extension settings as needed for your project

## Debugging

### Configure debugging

Set breakpoints to debug your code:

1. Click the left margin next to any line number
2. A red dot appears, indicating an active breakpoint

    If your breakpoints don't work, install the appropriate language extension (Python, Go, or C++) in the container environment.
    </Admonition>

### Start debugging:

1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel in the sidebar
2. Select your debug configuration such as `debug python`
3. Click the green play button to start

### Configuration notes

When debugging, VSCode starts the agent directly without the Go web server. This affects:
- Graph selection - must be configured manually
- RTC token generation - requires manual setup

This section guides you through resolving these issues.

#### Graph selection
Without the web server, you must manually configure the graph to run:

1. Open property.json
1. Set `auto_start: true` for your desired graph
1. Ensure only one graph has `auto_start` enabled

#### RTC properties

The web server normally generates RTC tokens automatically. In development mode:

1. Run the playground or demo first to generate tokens
1. Check logs for the temporary property file location:
    
    ```
    PropertyJsonFile:/tmp/astra/property-agora_74np6e-20241123_083855_000.json
    ```

1. Copy RTC tokens and channel names from the temporary file
1. Update your main `property.json` with these values
