In certain scenarios, it is necessary to process raw video captured through the camera to achieve specific functionalities or enhance user experience. The <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides the capability to pre-process and post-process the captured video data, allowing the implementation of custom playback effects.

## Technical Overview

For scenarios where there is a need to handle video data independently, Agora offers raw data functionality. You can preprocess the captured video frames before sending the data to the encoder or perform post-processing on the received video frames after sending the data to the decoder.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the operations, ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

## Implementation

Follow the steps below to implement raw video data functionality in your project:
