## Get the information of the Chat project

Agora Console assigns the following information to each project that enables the Chat service:

- **Data Center**: Agora provides several data centers for the service in different regions, including Beijing1 (China), Beijing VIP (China),  Singapore, Frankfurt (Germany), and Virginia (USA). After the plan is changed, the data center remains unchanged.
- **AppKey**: The unique identifier that the Chat service assigns to each app. The rule is `${OrgName}#{AppName}`.
- **OrgName**: The unique identifier that the Chat service assigns to each enterprise (organization).
- **AppName**: The name that the Chat service assigns to each app. Each app under the same enterprise (organization) must have a unique App Name.
- **API request url**: The domain of the WebSocket and RESTful API request that Agora assigns to each project.

Follow these steps to get the project information:

1. Find the project that has enabled the Chat service on the [Project management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page at Agora Console, and click **Config**.
2. On the project edit page, find **Chat** and click **Config**.
3. On the project config page, get the values of **Data Center**, **AppKey**, **OrgName**, **AppName**, **WebSocketAddress**, and **REST API**.

1. Log in to the [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Package**.

3. On the **Subscribe** tab, you can change your Chat plan by clicking **Subscribe** on other plans.
