<Vpd k="NAME"/> supports 2 transcription modes:

- Channel-based transcription for all active hosts in a channel. To enable it, see [REST Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart).
- Transcription of the specified hosts audio only and ignoring all other hosts.

This page explains how to implement transcription of specified hosts only.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must:

<Prerequisites />
- Make sure <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for your app.

## Implementation

To transcribe a specific host, follow the API call sequence from the [REST Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart) and modify the `start` request to add the `subscribeAudioUids` parameter as follows:

```shell
curl --location -g 'https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks?builderToken={{tokenName}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
{{
     "languages": [
         "<YourTranscribeLanguages>"
    ],
    "maxIdleTime": 50,
    "rtcConfig": {
        "channelName": "<YourChannelName>",        // The RTC channel name.
        "subBotUid": "<YourSubscribeUid>",         // The unique UID in the channel for the bot to subscribe to audio. Int UID needs to be filled as a string.
        "subBotToken": "<YourSubscribeToken>",     // The RTC token for subBot to join the RTC channel. Optional, based on the RTC channel security configuration.
        "pubBotUid": "<YourPublishUid>",           // The unique UID in the channel for the bot to publish text. Int UID needs to be filled as a string. subBotUid and pubBotUid MUST be different.
        "pubBotToken": "<YourPublishToken>",       // The RTC token for pubBot to join the RTC channel. Apply the admin token.
        "subscribeAudioUids": [uint],              // The UIDs of the hosts whose audio needs to be transcribed, max is 3.
    },
```
