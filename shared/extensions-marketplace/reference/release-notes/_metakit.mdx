### v2.2.0

v2.2.0 was released on September 13, 2024.

#### New features

**Stickers**

This version adds the sticker feature that uses the face capture driver and follows the character's head movements. The SDK provides subpackages for glasses (`material_sticker_glass`), masks (`material_sticker_facemask`), veils (`material_sticker_veil`), and dragon head hats (`material_sticker_dragonhat`). You can load the corresponding scene resources to quickly experience the effects of different stickers.

**Portrait edge light**

This release adds a new portrait edge light effect. To experience it, specify the subpackage resource as `material_effect_ray` when loading scene resources.

**Advertising light text-to-image**

This version adds a text-to-image feature for the advertising lights. When setting the advertising light effects, you can specify the text content through the `text` parameter and add animation effects through the `animation` parameter. This includes jumping, waving, or swaying, to make the text appear dynamically on the screen.

#### Improvements

This update adds support for `loadMaterial` and `unloadMaterial` in `setExtensionProperty`.

- When using `loadMaterial` to load scene resources, you can specify the resource path of the required subpackage. The engine will automatically request the scene texture and render the scene.
- If you need to switch to another scene, just use `loadMaterial` again to pass in another subpackage resource path. The engine will automatically switch to the new scene.
- When you no longer need to experience the scene, use `unloadMaterial` to uninstall scene resources.

This improvement significantly enhances the usability of the extension. You can quickly experience different functional scenarios by simply specifying different subpackage resource paths when loading.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `loadMaterial`
- `unloadMaterial`

### v2.1.0

v2.1.0 was released on March 6, 2024.

#### Improvements

This update optimizes the performance of the <Vg k="RTEE_MK"/> extension and adds support for two new `keys` in `setExtensionProperty`: [`requestTexture`](../develop/integrate/metakit#enable-texture-request) and [`switchTextureAvatarMode`](../develop/integrate/metakit#switch-texture-scene). These replace the original `addSceneView` and `switchAvatarMode` functions, respectively. The new interface supports automatic generation and return of texture data, which is then directly rendered, previewed, encoded, and transmitted through the SDK. This enhancement improves rendering performance, reduces latency, and ensures more efficient operation and a better user experience.

#### API changes

**Added**

- [`requestTexture`](../develop/integrate/metakit#enable-texture-request)
- [`switchTextureAvatarMode`](../develop/integrate/metakit#switch-texture-scene)

### v2.0.0

v2.0.0 was released on February 23, 2024.

This is the first release of the <Vg k="RTEE_MK"/> extension. This extension integrates multiple AI technologies to provide users with diverse video enhancement functions in audio and video interaction scenarios.
