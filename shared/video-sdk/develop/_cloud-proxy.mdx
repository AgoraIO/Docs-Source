You use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="CP"/> to ensure reliable connectivity for your users when they connect from an environment with a restricted network.


## Understand the tech of Cloud Proxy

Agora recommends upgrading to the latest SDK version, which supports all three operating modes:
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
-   <Vg k="VSDK" /> for <Vpl k="NAME" /> v<Vg k="VSDK_LATEST_RELEASE" />
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
-   <Vg k="VSDK" /> for <Vpl k="NAME" /> v<Vg k="VSDK_WEB_RELEASE_API" />
</PlatformWrapper>


To accommodate your end users’ firewall settings and business needs, <Vg k="CP"/> offers the following operating modes:

-   **Automatic**

    The default setting. In the Automatic mode of <Vg k="CP"/>, <Vpd k="SDK" /> first attempts a direct connection to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />; if the attempt fails, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically falls back and sends media securely on TLS 443. This is best practice when you are not sure if your end users are
    behind a firewall. Sending media over TLS 443 may not have as high quality UDP. However, a connection on TLS 443 works through most firewalls.

-   **Force UDP**

    In the Force UDP mode of <Vg k="CP"/>, <Vpd k="SDK" /> securely sends media over UDP only. Your end users’ firewall must be configured to trust a list of [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips).
    This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and require media with the highest possible quality. This mode does not support pushing streams to the CDN or relaying streams across
    channels.

-   **Force TCP**

    In the Force TCP mode of <Vg k="CP"/>, <Vpd k="SDK" /> securely sends media over TLS 443 only. This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and the firewall’s security policies only allow media to flow through
    TLS 443. In some cases the firewall might trust any traffic over TLS 443. However, in many cases the firewall is configured to trust only a specific range of IP addresses sending traffic over TLS 443. In this case, your end user’s firewall must be
    configured to trust a list of [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips). Media quality might be impacted if network conditions degrade.

The following figure shows the <Vg k="CP"/> workflow:

![cloud proxy](/images/video-sdk/cloud-proxy.png)

The steps you need to implement in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> are:

1.  Before connecting to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, set <Vpd k="SDK" /> to request a connection to <Vg k="CP"/>.

2.  When the request succeeds, <Vg k="CP"/> sends back the proxy information.

3.  <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards this data to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

4.  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards it to <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

-   Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

-   Configured your firewall to allow communication through the <Vg k="CP"/> [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips).


## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to use <Vg k="CP"/> feature in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

1.  **Enable and disable <Vg k="CP"/>**:

    -   If your estimated Peak Concurrent Users (PCU) during a month exceeds 200, and you want to use either Force UDP or Force TCP
        mode, contact [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Customer Support](mailto:support@agora.io) to activate <Vg k="CP"/>.

    -   If your estimated PCU during a month is 200 or less:

        1.  In [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/), click the **Project Management** icon on the left.

        2.  In **Project Management**, click **Config** for the project you want to enable <Vg k="CP"/> for.

        3.  Under **Features**, find **<Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes)**, then click **Enable**.

        4.  Read the **Enable Cloud Proxy** information carefully. Check the box showing you have read the page, then click
            **Enable**.

            Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/> within 24 hours.

        5.  Check the **Status** of <Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes). Once you see **Enabled**, Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/>.

        After activation, you can deactivate <Vg k="CP"/> at any time using [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/). <Vg k="CP"/> is deactivated immediately.

2.  **Open your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**:

    In your IDE, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.
    
## Implement communication using <Vg k="CP"/>

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement <Vg k="CP"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement/>

## Test your <Vg k="CP"/> implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="CP"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1.  [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
