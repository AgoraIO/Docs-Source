### Manage the contact list

Use this section to understand how to send a contact invitation, listen for contact events, and accept or decline the contact invitation.

#### Send a contact invitation

Call `addContact` to add the specified user as a contact:

```javascript
let message = 'Hello!';
WebIM.conn.addContact('username', message);   
```

#### Listen for contact events

Use `connection.addEventHandler` to add the following callback events. When a user receives a contact invitation, you can accept or decline the invitation.

```javascript
/**
 * msg indicates the result of triggering the callback
 */
connection.addEventHandler('CONTACT', {
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is received
    onContactInvited: function(msg){}
    // Occurs when the contact is deleted
    onContactDeleted: function(msg){}
    // Occurs when a contact is added
    onContactAdded: function(msg){}
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is declined
    onContactRefuse: function(msg){} 
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is approved
    onContactAgreed: function(msg){} 
})
```

#### Accept or decline the contact invitation

After receiving `onContactInvited`, call `acceptContactInvite` or `declineContactInvite` to accept or decline the invitation.

```javascript
/**
 * Accepts the contact invitation
 */
WebIM.conn.acceptContactInvite('username')

/**
 * Declines the contact invitation
 */
WebIM.conn.declineContactInvite('username')
```

#### Delete a contact

Call `deleteContact` to delete the specified contact. The deleted user receives the `onContactDeleted` callback.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.deleteContact('username');   
```

#### Retrieve the contact list

To get the contact list, you can call `getContacts`.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.getContacts().then( (res) => {
    console.log(res) // res.data > ['user1', 'user2']
}
```

### Manage the block list

You can add a specified user to your block list. Once you do that, you can still send chat messages to that user, but you cannot receive messages from them. 

<div class="note alert">Users can add any other chat user to their block list, regardless of whether this other user is a contact or not. A contact added to the block list remains in the contact list.</div>

#### Add a user to the block list

Call `addUsersToBlockList` to add the specified user to the block list.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.addUsersToBlocklist({
    name: ["user1", "user2"],
});
```


#### Remove a user from the block list

To remove the specified user from the block list, call `removeUserFromBlockList`.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.removeUserFromBlockList({
    name: ["user1", "user2"],
});
```

#### Retrieve the block list from the server

To get the block list, call `getBlocklist`. 

```javascript
WebIM.conn.getBlocklist();
```
