In <Vpd k="NAME" /> scenarios demanding high communication quality, pre-call detection aids in identifying and troubleshooting issues beforehand, ensuring seamless real-time interaction.

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">

This page shows you how to use <Vg k="VSDK"/> to run pre-call tests for identifying and troubleshooting communication quality issues in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that you test the device first and then perform a network test.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project.

## Implement connection status management

### Detection exception handling suggestions

Under the premise of ensuring that the API is called correctly, when encountering detection exceptions, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that you refer to the following table to take measures:

| Anomaly | Solution |
|:---|:---------------|
| Can't hear sound when detecting audio devices. | <ul><li>Check that the recording device and playback device are working properly and are not occupied by other programs.</li><li>Check if the network connection is normal.</li></ul> |
| Cannot see the screen when detecting video devices. | <ul><li>Check if the video device is working properly and not occupied by other programs.</li><li>Check whether the network connection is normal.</li></ul>  |
| Poor uplink network quality detected (packet loss > 5%; network jitter > 100ms) | <ul><li>Check that the local network is working properly.</li><li>Ensure that the bitrate of the published audio and video streams does not exceed the uplink available bandwidth by reducing the resolution or lowering the frame rate.</li></ul> |
| Poor downlink network quality detected (packet loss > 5%; network jitter > 100ms) | <ul><li>Check that the local network is working properly.</li><li>Ensure that the total bandwidth of the local subscription does not exceed the downstream available bandwidth by:<ul><li>Reducing the number of subscribed audio and video streams on the receiving end or reducing the bitrate of published audio and video streams on the sending end.</li><li>Enabling dual-stream mode on the sending side and requesting to receive small streams on the receiving side to reduce bandwidth consumption.</li><li>Enabling the video stream fallback function or the multiple streams by priority fallback function at the receiving end.</li></ul></li></ul> |
