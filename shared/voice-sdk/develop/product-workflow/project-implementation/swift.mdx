### Implement the user interface

In a real-world application, for each volume setting you want the user to control, you typically add a volume control UI element such as a <Link target="_blank" to="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uislider">UISlider</Link> to the audio configuration panel. To enable the user to mute local or remote audio, you add a <Link target="_blank" to="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiswitch">UISwitch</Link> to the interface for each user. In this example, you add a `UISlider` and a `UISwitch` to test different volume settings. 

To create this user interface, in the `ViewController` class:

1. **Add UI elements to manage volume and muting**

    Add the following variables at the head of the class with the other declarations:

    <CreateUI />

1. **Configure the buttons in your interface**

    Add the following lines to the `initViews` function:

    <ConfigureButtons />

    Xcode presents some build time errors. Worry not, this is for functions that you add to your project a bit later on.

### Implement volume control logic

To implement volume control in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. **Declare the variables you need**

    To read, store, and apply volume settings, add the following variables to the declarations at the top of the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    // Volume Control
    var volume: Int = 50
    var isMuted: Bool = false
    var remoteUid: UInt = 0 // Stores the uid of the remote user
    ```

1. **Setup volume control and mute**

    To change the volume or mute local or remote users:

    1. Store the `uid` of the remote user

        To adjust the volume or mute a specific remote user, you need the `uid` of that user. Add the following line at the beginning of the `func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, didJoinedOfUid uid: UInt, elapsed: Int) {` delegate to store the `uid` of the remote user:

        ```swift
        remoteUid = uid
        ```

    1. Adjust or mute the volume

        You use the `volumeSliderValueChanged` and `muteSwitchValueChanged` callbacks to handle the volume change actions taken by the user. Add the following callbacks to the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> event handler, `extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {`:

       <AdjustMuteVolume />

       When using a device to capture audio, <Vg k="ASDK" /> sets a default global volume value of 85 (range [0, 255]). <Vg k="ASDK" /> automatically increases a capture device volume that's too low. You can adjust the capture volume as per your needs by adjusting the microphone or sound card's signal capture volume.

        <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
        In <Vpl k="NAME" />, the audio route automatically switches to the earpiece due to system limitations. When using in-call volume, you can manually switch the audio route (eg: to speakerphone). <Vpl k="NAME" /> limitations does not allow audio route manual switching when using media volume.
        Refer [System volume documentation](../../help/integration-issues/system_volume) to know if you are using in-call or media volume.
