### Channel modes

The <Vpd k="SDK"/> supports the following channel modes: 

- `rtc`: Communication use-case
- `live`: Live broadcast use-case

#### Communication use-case

It is suitable for use-cases where all users in the channel need to communicate with each other and the total number of users is not too large, such as multi-person conferences and online chats.

#### Live broadcast use-case

It is suitable for use-cases where there are few publishers but many subscribers. In this use-case, the SDK defines two user roles: audience (default) and host. Hosts can send and receive <Vpd k="MEDIA" />, but audience cannot send and may only receive <Vpd k="MEDIA" />. You can specify user roles by setting the parameters `createClient` of role, or you can call `setClientRole` to dynamically modify user roles.

### Video encoding formats

You can set the `codec` parameter in the `createClient` method to the following video encoding formats:

- `vp8` (VP8)
- `h264` (H.264)
- `vp9` (VP9)

This setting only affects the video encoding format of the host. For the audience, as long as their device and browser support the decoding of this format, the subscription can be completed normally.

Support for these formats may vary across browsers and devices. The following table lists the `codec` formats supported by different browsers for reference:

| Browser             | VP8 | H.264        | VP9               |
|:---------------------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| Desktop Chrome 58+ | ✔   | ✔             | ✔                 |
| Firefox 56+         | ✔   | ✔| ✔(Requires Firefox 69+) |
| Safari 12.1+        | ✔   | ✔             | ✔(Requires Safari 16+) |
| Safari < 12.1       | ✘   | ✔             | ✘                 |
| AndroidChrome 58+   | ✔   | No clear information | ✔(Requires Chrome 68+) |

<Admonition type="info" info="Hint">
- H.264 support on Firefox depends on the `OpenH264` video codec plug-in from Cisco Systems, Inc. 
- For Chrome, support for H.264 on Android devices varies based on device hardware compatibility with hardware codecs mandated by Chrome.

### Local <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> tracks

The SDK uses a hierarchy where all local track objects derive from the `LocalTrack` base class. This class defines the common behavior for all local tracks. Specific track types, such as `LocalAudioTrack` and `LocalVideoTrack` inherit from `LocalTrack` and extend its functionality.

To publish a local track, you call the `publish` method of the client with the `LocalTrack` object as an input parameter. This approach makes publishing a track independent of how you create your local track.

There are two main types of local tracks: `LocalAudioTrack` and `LocalVideoTrack` for publishing audio and video, respectively. Each type of `LocalTrack` comes with its own set of tools. For example, `LocalAudioTrack` lets you control the volume, while `LocalVideoTrack` has functions for customizing video.

The SDK includes more specific classes based on `LocalAudioTrack` and `LocalVideoTrack`. For example, the `CameraVideoTrack`, is a type of `LocalVideoTrack` that you can use to publish video from your camera. It comes with extra features for controlling the camera and adjusting video quality.

The following diagram the relationship between the `LocalTrack` classes:

### Other integration methods

When you use `npm` to install the Web SDK, you can enable tree shaking to reduce the size of the app after integration. For details, see [Using tree shaking](../best-practices/app-size-optimization#use-tree-shaking).

In addition to using `npm` to install the Web SDK, you can also use the following methods:

* In the project HTML file, add the following tag to obtain the SDK from CDN:

    ```html
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTC_N-4.23.1.js"></script>
    ```

* Download the <Vpd k="SDK"/> package locally, save the `.js` files in the SDK package to the project directory, and then add the following tag to the project HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="./AgoraRTC_N-4.23.1.js"></script>
    ```

Visit the [Download](/sdks?platform=web) page to obtain the link for the latest SDK version.

### Frequently asked questions

* [What are the differences between various live broadcasting solutions?](/help/general-product-inquiry/streaming_difference)

**Why do I get a `digital envelope routines::unsupported` error when running the quickstart project locally?**

This issue arises in projects configured with `webpack` for local execution due to changes in Node.js 16 and above. The modifications in Node.js, particularly its dependency on OpenSSL (detailed in the [node issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29817)), impact the local development environment dependencies of the project. Refer to the [webpack issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532) for details. 

Use one of the following solutions to resolve the issue:

* Run the following command to set a temporary environment variable (Recommended):

    ```shell
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
    ```

* Temporarily switch to a lower version of Node.js.
