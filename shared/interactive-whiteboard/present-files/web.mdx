The Agora Fastboard SDK supports inserting and displaying multiple types of files on the whiteboard, such as images, audio and video, and documents. This enables users to quickly share information in compelling ways in order to create an immersive experience.

This page describes how to call the Fastboard SDK's APIs to insert images, present documents, and play audio and video on the whiteboard.

## Insert Images

<Vg k="FAST" /> provides the [`insertImage`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertimage) method for inserting and displaying an image in the main window of the whiteboard. You can call this method and pass in the URL of the image to display a specified image.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the image. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the image cannot be displayed properly.

- Make sure that the image is in PNG, JPG/JPEG, or WEBP format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement inserting an image in the [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Open the `main.js` file, and add the following after `mountFastboard(document.getElementById("app"));`:
    ```javascript
        await app.insertImage(
            "https://web-cdn.agora.io/website-files/images/interactive-whiteboard-text-tab-1.png"
        );
    ```
2. Run the following command to run the project:
    ```sh
        npm run dev
    ```
You can see the inserted image after the `index.html` page opens.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for `insertImage`. You need to implement the UI yourself.</div>

## Play audio and video

<Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the media player extension and provides the [`insertMedia`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertmedia) method for playing audio and video files. You can simply call `insertMedia` and pass in the audio and video file name and URL to play the audio and video in a sub-window on the whiteboard.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the audio or video. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the audio and video cannot be loaded properly.

- Make sure that the audio and video files are in MP3 or MP4 format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement playing a video in the [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Open the `main.js` file, and add the following after `mountFastboard(document.getElementById("app"));`:
    ```javascript
        await app.insertMedia(
            "test1.mp4",
            "https://beings.oss-cn-hxxxou.aliyuncs.com/test/aaa59xxxxxxxc695def4/1606277539701637%E7%9A%84%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC.mp4"
        );
    ```

2. Run the following command to run the project:

    ```javascript
        npm run dev
    ```

You can see the sub-window named `test1.mp4` after the `index.html` page opens. Click the start button to play the video.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for insertMedia. You need to implement the UI yourself.</div>

## Present documents

<Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the docs viewer and slide extensions and provides the [`insertDocs`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertdocs-12) method for presenting documents. You can simply call `insertDocs` and pass the parameters of a document to present the document in a paginated format in a sub-window on the whiteboard. The implementation workflow is as follows:

1. Call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#start-file-conversion) to convert the source document to a paginated set of images or web pages.

2. Call the [Query file conversion progress (GET) API](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#query-the-progress-of-a-file-conversion-task) to get the conversion result.

3. Call `insertDocs`, and pass the width, height, and URL of each image or web page in order in the scenes parameter.

When converting a source document to images or web pages, note the following:

- Ensure the format of the converted images or web pages is supported by <Vg k="FAST" />.

    <Vg k="FAST" /> supports inserting and displaying images or web pages in the following formats:

    - Static images in PNG, JPG/JPEG, and WEBP formats converted from PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF files. See [Static-file conversion service](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#static-file-conversion).

    - HTML web pages converted from PPTX files. See [Dynamic-file conversion service](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#dynamic-file-conversion).

- Ensure the converted images or web pages are accessible on the public network.
    
    In addition, if the server that stores the images or web pages has a different domain from that of your web application, you need to configure [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS); otherwise, your app clients might fail to access and load these images or web pages.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Complete file conversion, and generate a set of URLs for the converted images or web pages.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement presenting a three-page, animated PPTX file in the [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Upload the PPTX source document to a third-party cloud storage service, and call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#start-file-conversion) to create a dynamic-file conversion task that converts the PPTX file to HTML web pages.

2. Call the [Query file conversion progress (GET) API](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#query-the-progress-of-a-file-conversion-task) to get the file conversion result.

3. Open the [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project, and add the following lines to the `main.js` file:
    ```javascript
        // Pass the conversion result (the entire response body returned by the Query file conversion progress (GET) API) in the response parameter.
        var response = {
            "uuid": "01xxxx82",
            "type": "dynamic",
            "status": "Finished",
            "progress": {
                "totalPageSize": 3,
                "convertedPageSize": 3,
                "convertedPercentage": 100,
                "convertedFileList": [
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/1.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/1.png"
                    },
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/2.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/2.png"
                    },
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/3.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/3.png"
                    }
                ],
                "currentStep": "Packaging"
            }
        };
 
        // Call insertDocs to insert the doc.
        var btn = document.getElementById("addPPT");
        btn.onclick = async function addPPT() {
            await app.insertDocs("My PPT", response);
        };
    ```

4. Add the following code to the `index.html` file to load the button for displaying the document on the web page:
    ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8" />
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
                <title>Vite App</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div
                        id="app"
                        style="width: 600px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid;"
                ></div>
                <!--Define the style of the button and add it to the web page-->
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                <div id="viewDocs" class="Prev" style="width: 50px; border: 1px solid; position: fixed; bottom: 430px; right：20px;">
                    Show My PPT
                </div>
            </div>
                <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
                </body>
            </html>
    ```
You can see the **Show My PPT** button when the `index.html` page opens. Click the button, and the SDK loads your document in a sub-window. Click the arrow to show your document page by page.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> also provides another `insertDocs method` for inserting and displaying documents. For details, see [API reference](../../reference/uikit-sdk/).</div>
