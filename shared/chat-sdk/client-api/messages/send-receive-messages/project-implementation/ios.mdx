### Send a text message

Use the `AgoraChatTextMessageBody` class to create a text message, and then send the message.

```objc
// Call initWithText to create a text message. Set content as the text content and toChatUsername to the username to whom you want to send this text message.
AgoraChatTextMessageBody *textMessageBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:content];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername
                                                        to:toChatUsername
                                                      body:textMessageBody
                                                       ext:messageExt];
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message
                                               progress:nil
                                             completion:nil];
```

### Set message priority

For chat room messages, Agora Chat provides three message priorities: High, normal, and low. High-priority messages are delivered first. You can assign a high priority to a certain type of messages in a chat room or to a specified member to ensure that these messages are delivered first. This method ensures that when messages are sent concurrently in large quantities or at a high rate, the important ones can be delivered first, thereby increasing the reliability of their delivery. When the load on the server is high, low-priority messages are discarded first to reserve resources for high-priority messages. However, the message priority function only ensures that high-priority messages arrive first. It does not guarantee their arrival, because even high-priority messages are still dropped when the server load is too high.

```objective-c
AgoraChatTextMessageBody* textBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:@"Hi"];
    AgoraChatMessage* message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:@"roomId" body:textBody ext:nil];
    message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChatRoom;
    // Set the message priority. The default value is `Normal`, indicating the normal priority.
    message.priority = AgoraChatRoomMessagePriorityHigh;
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager sendMessage:message progress:nil completion:nil];
```

### Receive a message

You can use `AgoraChatManagerDelegate` to listen for message events. You can add multiple delegates to listen for multiple events. When you no longer listen for an event, ensure that you remove the listener.

When a message arrives, the recipient receives an `messagesDidReceive` callback. Each callback contains one or more messages. You can traverse the message list, and parse and render these messages in this callback and render these messages.

```objc
// Adds the delegate.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager addDelegate:self delegateQueue:nil];

// Occurs when the message is received.
- (void)messagesDidReceive:(NSArray<AgoraChatMessage*> *)aMessages
{
  // Traverse the message list
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aMessages) {
    // Parse the message and display it on the UI
  }
}

// Removes the delegate.
- (void)dealloc
{
  [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager removeDelegate:self];
}
```


### Recall a message

Two minutes after a user sends a message, this user can withdraw it. Contact support@agora.io if you want to adjust the time limit.

```objc
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager recallMessageWithMessageId:@"messageId" completion:^(AgoraChatError *aError) {
        if (!aError) {
               NSLog(@"Recalling message succeeds");
           } else {
               NSLog(@"Recalling message fails — %@", aError.errorDescription);
           }
    }];
```

You can also use `messagesDidRecall` to listen for the message recall state:

```objc
/**
 * Occurs when a received message is recalled.
 */
- (void)messagesDidRecall:(NSArray *)aMessages;
```

### Send and receive an attachment message

Voice, image, video, and file messages are essentially attachment messages. This section introduces how to send these types of messages.

#### Send and receive a voice message

Before sending a voice message, you should implement audio recording on the app level, which provides the URI and duration of the recorded audio file.

Refer to the following code example to create and send a voice message:

```objc
// Set localPath as the local path of the voice file and displayName the display name of the attachment.
AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody alloc] initWithLocalPath:localPath
                          							     displayName:displayName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:nil];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the audio file:

```objc
AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *voiceBody = (AgoraChatVoiceMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the audio file on the server.
NSString *voiceRemotePath = voiceBody.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the audio file on the local device.
NSString *voiceLocalPath = voiceBody.localPath;
```

#### Send and receive an image message

By default, the SDK compresses the image file before sending it. To send the original file, you can set `original` as `true`.

Refer to the following code example to create and send an image message:

```objc
// Set imageData as the path of the image file on the local device, and displayName as the display name of the file.
AgoraChatImageMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatImageMessageBody alloc] initWithData:imageData
                          							            displayName:displayName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the thumbnail and attachment file of the image message:

```objc
AgoraChatImageMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatImageMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the image file on the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the image thumbnail from the server.
NSString *thumbnailPath = body.thumbnailRemotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the image file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
// Retrieves the path of the image thumbnail on the local device.
NSString *thumbnailLocalPath = body.thumbnailLocalPath;
```

<div class="alert note">If <code>[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].options.isAutoDownloadThumbnail</code> is set as <code>YES</code> on the recipient's client, the SDK automatically downloads the thumbnail after receiving the message. If not, you need to call <code>[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageThumbnail:message progress:nil completion:nil];</code> to download the thumbnail and get the path from the <code>thumbnailLocalPath</code> member in <code>messageBody</code>.</div>

#### Send and receive a video message

Before sending a video message, you should implement video capturing on the app level, which provides the duration of the captured video file.

Refer to the following code example to create and send a video message:

```objc
// Set localPath as the path of the video file on the local device and displayName the display name of the video file.
AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatVideoMessageBody alloc] initWithLocalPath:localPath displayName:@"displayName"];
// The duration of the video file
body.duration = duration;

AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message 
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];

```

By default, when the recipient receives the message, the SDK downloads the thumbnail of the video message. 

If you do not want the SDK to automatically download the video thumbnail, set `[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].options.isAutoDownloadThumbnail` as `NO`, and to download the thumbnail, you need to call `[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageThumbnail:message progress:nil completion:nil]`, and get the path of the thumbnail from the `thumbnailLocalPath` member in `messageBody`.

To download the actual video file, call `[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager downloadMessageAttachment:progress:completion:]`, and get the path of the video file from the `getLocalUri` member in `messageBody`.

```objc
AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatVideoMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the video file from the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the thumbnail of the video file from the server.
NSString *thumbnailPath = body.thumbnailRemotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the video file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
// Retrieves the thumbnail of the video file on the local deivce.
NSString *thumbnailLocalPath = body.thumbnailLocalPath;
```

#### Send and receive a file message

Refer to the following code example to create, send, and receive a file message:

```objc
// Set fileData as the path of the file on the local device, and fileName the display name of the attachment file.
AgoraChatFileMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatFileMessageBody  initWithData:fileData 
                           							            displayName:fileName];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     								                    to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

While sending a file message, refer to the following sample code to get the progress for uploading the attachment file:

```objc
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message progress:^(int progress) {
		//progress indicates the progress of uploading the attachment
} completion:^(AgoraChatMessage *message, AgoraChatError *error) {
    //error indicates the result of sending the message, and message indicates the sent message
}];
```

When the recipient receives the message, refer to the following code example to get the attachment file:

```objc
AgoraChatFileMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatFileMessageBody *)message.body;
// Retrieves the path of the attachment file from the server.
NSString *remotePath = body.remotePath;
// Retrieves the path of the attachment file on the local device.
NSString *localPath = body.localPath;
```

### Send a location message

To send and receive a location message, you need to integrate a third-party map service provider. When sending a location message, you get the longitude and latitude information of the location from the map service provider; when receiving a location message, you extract the received longitude and latitude information and displays the location on the third-party map.

```objc
// Sets the latitude and longitude information of the location.
AgoraChatLocationMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatLocationMessageBody alloc] initWithLatitude:latitude longitude:longitude address:aAddress];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

### Send and receive a CMD message

CMD messages are command messages that instruct a specified user to take a certain action. The recipient deals with the command messages themselves.

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>CMD messages are not stored in the local database.</li><li>Actions beginning with `em_` and `easemob::` are internal fields. Do not use them.</li></ul></div>

```objc
// Use action to customize the CMD message
AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatCmdMessageBody alloc] initWithAction:action];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											                       progress:nil
  											                     completion:nil];
```

To notify the recipient that a CMD message is received, use a separate delegate so that users can deal with the message differently.

```objc
// Occurs when the CMD message is received.
- (void)cmdMessagesDidReceive:(NSArray *)aCmdMessages{
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aCmdMessages) {
        AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *)message.body;
        // Parse the message body
    }
}
```

#### Implement typing indicators via CMD messages

Typing indicators signify when other users are typing a message. This feature enables users to communicate efficiently and sets users' expectations about new interactions in a chat app. You can implement typing indicators via CMD messages. 

The following diagram explains how typing indicators work.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1665389553627)

Listen for the input status of user A. Once there is text input, the input status is sent to user B through a command message, and user B receives the input status that indicates that user A is typing.

 - User A sends a message to user B indicating the starting input status.
 - After receiving the message, if user B is currently on the chat page of with user A, the typing indicator of user A is displayed.
 - If user B receives the ending input status of user A or have not received from user A again after a few seconds, the typing indicator is automatically canceled.

**Note：**
User A can set the sending interval between CMD messages as needed.

The following code example shows how to send a CMD message of the input status.

```objc
#define MSG_TYPING_BEGIN @"TypingBegin"

- (void)textViewDidChange:(UITextView *)textView
{
    long long currentTimestamp = [self getCurrentTimestamp];
    // Do not send messages repeatedly within 5s.
    if ((currentTimestamp - _previousChangedTimeStamp) > 5) {
        // Sends a CMD message of starting typing.
        [self _sendBeginTyping];
        _previousChangedTimeStamp = currentTimestamp;
    }
}

- (void)_sendBeginTyping
{
    AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = [[AgoraChatCmdMessageBody alloc] initWithAction:MSG_TYPING_BEGIN];
    // Only deliver this CMD message to online users.
    body.isDeliverOnlineOnly = YES;
    AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:conversationId body:body ext:nil];
    message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
    [[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message progress:nil completion:nil];
}
```

The following code example shows how to receive and parse a CMD message of the input status.

```objc
#define TypingTimerCountNum 10
- (void)cmdMessagesDidReceive:(NSArray *)aCmdMessages
{
    NSString *conId = self.currentConversation.conversationId;
    for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aCmdMessages) {
        if (![conId isEqualToString:message.conversationId]) {
            continue;
        }
        AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *body = (AgoraChatCmdMessageBody *)message.body;
        // Receives a CMD message of starting typing.
        if ([body.action isEqualToString:MSG_TYPING_BEGIN]) {
            if (_receiveTypingCountDownNum == 0) {
                [self startReceiveTypingTimer];
            }else {
                _receiveTypingCountDownNum = TypingTimerCountNum;
            }
        }

    }
}

- (void)startReceiveTypingTimer {
    [self stopReceiveTypingTimer];
    _receiveTypingCountDownNum = TypingTimerCountNum;
    _receiveTypingTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1.0 target:self selector:@selector(startReceiveCountDown) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];

    [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] addTimer:_receiveTypingTimer forMode:UITrackingRunLoopMode];
    [_receiveTypingTimer fire];
    // Updates the UI.
}

- (void)startReceiveCountDown
{
    if (_receiveTypingCountDownNum == 0) {
        [self stopReceiveTypingTimer];
        // Updates the UI.
        
        return;
    }
    _receiveTypingCountDownNum--;
}

- (void)stopReceiveTypingTimer {
    _receiveTypingCountDownNum = 0;
    if (_receiveTypingTimer) {
        [_receiveTypingTimer invalidate];
        _receiveTypingTimer = nil;
    }
}
```

### Send a customized message

Custom messages are self-defined key-value pairs that include the message type and the message content.

The following code example shows how to create and send a customized message:

```objc
// Set event as the custom message event, for example "userCard".
// Set ext as the extension field of the event, for example as uid, nichname, and avatar.
AgoraChatCustomMessageBody* body = [[AgoraChatCustomMessageBody alloc] initWithEvent:@"userCard" customExt:@{@"uid":aUid ,@"nickname":aNickName,@"avatar":aUrl}];
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                      from:fromChatUsername 
                     									                  to:toChatUsername 
                     								                  body:body
                                                       ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat;
// Set the chat type as Group chat. You can also set is as chat (one-to-one chat) or chat room.
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeGroupChat;
// Sends the message.
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  											   progress:nil
  											 completion:nil];
       
```

### Use message extensions

If the message types listed above do not meet your requirements, you can use message extensions to add attributes to the message. This can be applied in more complicated messaging scenarios.

```objc
AgoraChatTextMessageBody *textMessageBody = [[AgoraChatTextMessageBody alloc] initWithText:content];
// Adds the message extension.
NSDictionary *messageExt = @{@"attribute":@"value"};
AgoraChatMessage *message = [[AgoraChatMessage alloc] initWithConversationID:toChatUsername
                                                       from:fromChatUsername 
                     																		 to:toChatUsername 
                     																	 body:textMessageBody
                                                        ext:messageExt];
message.chatType = AgoraChatTypeChat; 
// Sends the message 
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient].chatManager sendMessage:message 
  																						 progress:nil
  																					 completion:nil];

// Retrieves the extension when receiving the message
- (void)messagesDidReceive:(NSArray *)aMessages
{
  // Traverse the message list
  for (AgoraChatMessage *message in aMessages) {
     //value indicates the value of the attribute field in the message extension
     NSString *value = [message.ext objectForKey:@"attribute"];
  }
}
```
