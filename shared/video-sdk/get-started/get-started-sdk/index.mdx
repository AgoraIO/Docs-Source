<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> enables one-to-one or small-group video interactions with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>s.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> enables you to host live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video interaction into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s.
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> for applications where ultra-low latency (400-800ms) is needed to keep audiences engaged, such as talk shows, sports broadcasts and live auctions. For further information on setting the audience latency level in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, see the [Call quality](../develop/ensure-channel-quality) and [Pricing](../overview/pricing#unit-pricing) guides.

<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> enables you to host large-scale live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video interaction into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s.
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> for applications where low latency (1500-2000ms) is needed for limited audience engagement, such as podcasts, gaming streams and other virtual events. For further information on setting the audience latency level in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, see the [Call quality](../develop/ensure-channel-quality) and [Pricing](../overview/pricing#unit-pricing) guides.

Thanks to <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network ([<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />](../overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn)), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This page shows you how to integrate the <Vg k="VSDK"/> and implement a simple real-time interactive <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> from scratch with a small amount of code.

## Understand the tech


This section explains how you can integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the basic workflow you need to integrate this feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

Following are some basic concepts about real-time audio and video interaction:

- **<Vg k="VSDK"/>**: An SDK developed by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to help developers realize real-time audio and video interaction in Apps.
- **Channel**: A channel is used to transmit data. Users in the same channel can interact in real time.
- **Host**: A host can publish audio and video in a channel. The h can also subscribe to audio and video published by other anchors.
- **Audience**: A user with the audience role can subscribe to audio and video in the channel, but does not have the permission to publish audio and video.

For more information, see [Core Concepts](../overview/core-concepts).

In an <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> event, hosts stream a video feed to an audience. For example, when a CEO is giving a speech to the company employees, the CEO does not need to see all members of the audience. To represent this in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, when you join as a host, the local feed is started and you see your own video feed. When you join as a member of the audience, you see the host's video feed.

To start a session, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- *Set the channel profile and role.*
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
- *Set the latency level.*
</ProductWrapper>
- *Retrieve a token*: A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. In this guide you retrieve your token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To see how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

- *Join a channel*: Call methods to create and join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- *Host publishes local video and audio to the channel*: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. Each host can publish their local video to the channel.
- *Audience subscribes to video and audio published by the hosts to the channel*: Audience members view content published by hosts to the channel.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
- *Send and receive video and audio in the channel*: All users send and receive video and audio streams from all users in the channel.
</ProductWrapper>
