## Using Playground

Once you have the playground running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you can customize your agent in three simple steps:

![Customize your agent](/images/ten-agent/module-example.gif)

1. Select a graph type 

   - Choose between Voice Agent, Realtime Agent, or other types

2. Select a module

   - Choose a module that matches your chosen graph type

3. Configure Extensions
   - Select extensions and configure their API keys
   - Adjust settings as needed

The playground provides an intuitive interface to connect these components without coding.

## Changing the code yourself

If you feel comfortable editing the code yourself, you are more than welcome to do so. In `agents/property.json`, find the corresponding graph and manipulate any values you want.

After making changes, simply refresh the page and connect to the agent, and the changes will take effect.
