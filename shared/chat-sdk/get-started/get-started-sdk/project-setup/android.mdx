<PlatformWrapper platform="android">

To integrate <Vpd k="NAME"/> into your app, do the following:

1. Method 1: Use `mavenCentral` to automatically integrate:

    1. In Android Studio, create a new **Phone and Tablet** [Android project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/create-project) with an **Empty Activity**. Choose **Java** as the project language, and ensure that the **Minimum SDK** version is set to `21` or higher. 

        Android Studio automatically starts gradle sync. Wait for the sync to succeed before you continue.

    1. Add <Vpd k="SDK"/> to your project dependencies. 

        To add the SDK to your project:
        
        1. In `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle (Module: <projectname>.app)`, add the following line under `dependencies`:

            ```groovy
            dependencies {
                ...
                implementation 'io.agora.rtc:chat-sdk:<version>'
            }
            ```

            Replace `<version>` with the version number for the latest <Vpd k="SDK"/> release, for example `1.0.9`. You can obtain the latest version information using [Maven Central Repository Search](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.agora.rtc%20AND%20a:chat-sdk).

        1. To download the SDK from Maven Central, press **Sync Now**.

    1. Add permissions for network and device access.

        To add the necessary permissions, in `/app/Manifests/AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following permissions after `</application>`:
            
        ```xml
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
        ```

    1. Prevent code obfuscation.

    In `/Gradle Scripts/proguard-rules.pro`, add the following line:

    ```java
    -keep class io.agora.** {*;}
    -dontwarn  io.agora.**
    ```

1. Method 2: Dynamically load .so library files

    In order to reduce the size of the application installation package, the SDK provides `EMOptions#setNativeLibBasePath` method to support dynamic loading of the `.so` files required by the SDK. Taking SDK 4.5.0 as an example, the `.so` file includes two files: `libcipherdb.so` and `.libhyphenate.so`. The steps to implement this function are as follows:

    1. Download the latest version of the SDK and unzip it.
    1. Integrate the `.jar` file into your project.
    1. Upload `.so` files for all schemas to your server and ensure that the application can download `.so` files for the target schemas over the network.
    1. When the application runs, it checks whether the `.so` file exists. If not found, the app downloads the `.so` file and saves it to your custom app's private directory.
    1. When calling `EMClient#initinitialization`, set the app private directory where the `.so` file is located as a parameter into the `EMOptions#setNativeLibBasePath` method.
    1. After calling `EMClient#initinitialization`, the SDK will automatically load `.so` files from the specified path.

    ```Java
    //It is assumed that the user has put the two .so libraries libcipherdb.so and libhyphenate.so in the Agora SDK into the /data/data/packagename/files directory of the app through dynamic delivery.
    String filesPath = mContext.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath();

    EMOptions options = new EMOptions();
    options.setNativeLibBasePath(filesPath);

    EMClient.getInstance().init(mContext, options);
    ```
</PlatformWrapper>
