To implement call notification, you need to integrate the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />, the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, and platform-specific call APIs such as ConnectionService for Android, CallKit for iOS, and CallKeep for Flutter and React Native. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> supports call notification only when the app is running. So, you also need to integrate platform-specific APIs to ensure that users can still receive call notifications when the app is on the background or the process is closed.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Integrate the <Vg k="VSDK" /> and the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />

Refer to the following articles to learn how to integrate the VSDK and the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />:

-   [<Vg k="ILS" /> quickstart](/interactive-live-streaming/get-started/get-started-sdk)
-   [<Vg k="VIDEO" /> quickstart](/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk)
-   [<Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> quickstart](/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk)

### Step 2: Use the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to implement the basic functionalities of call invitation

To implement call invitation for the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, see
[Call Invitation](call-invitation).

### Step 3: Integrate platform-specific call APIs and implement call notification

-   For the Android platform, see [ConnectionService official documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/ConnectionService).

-   For the iOS platform, see [CallKit official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit).

-   For the Flutter platform and the React Native platform, refer to the official documentation of [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/callkeep) and [React Native](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep).
