A <Vpd k="NAME"/> agent subscribes to the audio content of a media stream and transcribes it into text in real time. This page shows you how to use basic RESTful API methods to start, stop, and query a <Vpd k="NAME"/> agent.

<Admonition type="info">
The command-line examples are for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, send RESTful API requests through your application server.

## Understand the tech

The following diagram outlines the process of implementing <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

    ![real-time-stt-flow](/images/real-time-stt/real-time-stt-flow.png)

This process includes calling the following RESTful API methods:

1. `start`: Call this method to join the channel and start transcription. If the request is successful, you receive an `agent_id` in the response body that identifies the current transcription session.

1. `update`: While a transcription agent is running, use the `update` method to modify transcription or translation languages or update the hosts for which transcription is enabled. 

1. `query`: Use this method to query the agent status between `start` and `stop` calls.

1. `stop`: Call this method to stop transcription.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must:

## Project setup

To enable <Vpd k="NAME"/> before using it for the first time, take the following steps:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> and open the **Projects** page.
1. Find the project for which you want to enable <Vpd k="NAME"/> and click the ✏️ icon.
1. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Real-Time Speech-to-Text** and click **Enable Real-Time-STT**.
1. Click **Enable Real-Time STT** and **Confirm**.

Now you can use Agora <Vpd k="NAME"/> and see the usage statistics on the **Usage** page.

## Implement <Vpd k="NAME"/>

This section presents sample API calls to `start`, `stop`, `update`, and `query` a <Vpd k="NAME"/> agent.

### Authentication

<Vpd k="NAME"/> RESTful APIs require basic HTTP authentication. Set the `Authorization` parameter to a Base64-encoded credential in every HTTP request header. For details on how to get the `Authorization` value, see [RESTful authentication](../rest-api/restful-authentication).

### Start an agent

Call `start` to start subtitle recording and translation.

When the request is successful you receive an `agent_id` in the HTTP response body. This ID is a unique identifier of your transcription session.

**Request example**

Following is a simple request example to start a <Vpd k="NAME"/> agent. Refer to [Encrypt captions](../develop/encrypt-captions), [Record captions](../develop/record-captions), and [Transcribe specified hosts](../develop/transcribe-individual-host) for more feature configurations.

```shell
curl --request post \
  --url https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/:appid/join \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>' \
  --data '
{
  "languages": [
    "en-US"
  ],
  "name": "agora-test",
  "maxIdleTime": 50,
  "rtcConfig": {
    "channelName": "agora-test",
    "subBotUid": "47091",
    "pubBotUid": "88222"
  },
  "translateConfig": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "source": "en-US",
        "target": [
          "ar-SA",
          "id-ID",
          "fr-FR",
          "ja-JP"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "captionConfig": {
    "sliceDuration": 60,
    "storage": {
      "accessKey": "test-oss",
      "secretKey": "test-oss",
      "bucket": "test-oss",
      "vendor": 2,
      "region": 3
    }
  }
}'
```

<Admonition type=""info>
- String UIDs are supported only on a 128 host environment, with full support planned in the near future.
- `pubBotUid` and `subBotUid` are `int` type UIDs that must be different to avoid unknown issues.

**Response example**

- Success

    ```json
    {
      "agent_id": "Agent ID.",
      "create_ts": null,
      "status": "RUNNING"
    }
    ```

    | Parameter Name | Type   | Description                             |
    |----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
    | `agent_id`       | String | The ID of the agent. |
    | `createTs`     | Integer | The Unix timestamp (seconds) when the agent was created. |
    | `status`       | String   | Agent Status:<br/><ul><li>`IDLE`: The agent is not initialized.</li><li>`STARTING`: The agent is starting.</li><li>`RUNNING`: The agent is running.</li><li>`STOPPING`: The agent is exiting.</li><li>`STOPPED`: The agent exited successfully.</li><li>`RECOVERING`: The agent is recovering.</li><li>`FAILED`: Agent exit failed.</li></ul> |


- Failure

    ```json
    {
      "detail": "Details of the request failure.",
      "reason": "The reason why the request failed."
    }
    ```

### Query agent status

Call `query` to get the status of an agent during a transcription session. When the request is successful, you receive the current status and related information in the response body.

**Request example**

```shell
curl --request get \
  --url https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/:appid/agents/:agentId \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>'
```

**Response example**

- Success

    ```json
    {
      "message": "Details of the request result.",
      "agent_id": "Agent ID.",
      "create_ts": null,
      "status": "RUNNING"
    }
    ```

- Failure

    ```json
    {
      "message": "Details of the failed request.",
      "agent_id": "Agent ID.",
      "create_ts": null,
      "status": "FAILED"
    }
    ```

### Update configuration

See [Update configuration](../develop/update-service) for details.

### Stop the agent

Call `stop` to stop transcribing. When the request is successful, you receive the status of the transcription session in the response body.

**Request example**

```shell
curl --request post \
  --url https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/:appid/agents/:agentId/leave \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>'
```

### Demo app and source code

Check out the [demo](https://stt-demo.agora.io) to try out <Vpd k="NAME"/> and evaluate its accuracy and latency.

You can also refer to the [demo code on Github](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Agora-RTT-Demo) to see how captions and transcription are implemented. For more demo code, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### REST API middleware 

[Agora Go Backend Middleware](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-go-backend-middleware) is an open-source microservice that exposes a RESTful API designed to simplify <Vpd k="NAME" /> interactions with Agora. Written in Golang and powered by the Gin framework, this community project serves as a middleware to bridge front-end applications using Agora's <Vg k="VSDK" /> or <Vg k="ASDK" /> with Agora's RESTful APIs.
