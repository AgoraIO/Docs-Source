### Switch the domain name

To ensure high availability of REST services, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> enables you to switch domain names when you experience service outage due to regional network failures. Take the following steps to set up and switch your domain name:

1. Set the primary domain name based on the location of your service server:
    - If the DNS address of the service server is located in a country or region other than mainland China, set the primary domain name to `api.agora.io`.
    - If the DNS address of the service server is in mainland China, set the primary domain name to `api.sd-rtn.com`.

2. If your attempt to initiate a RESTful API request using the primary domain fails, set up your retry strategy as follows:
    
    1. **Primary domain retry**: Retry using the same primary domain name.
    
    1. **Alternate domain retry**:
        - If the current primary domain name is `api.sd-rtn.com`, use `api.agora.io` as the  alternate domain name.
        - If the current primary domain name is `api.agora.io`, use `api.sd-rtn.com` as the alternate domain name.
    
    1. **Adjacent domain retry**: If alternate domain retry fails, retry using the domain name adjacent to the current region.

        For example, suppose your business server is located in Europe. You set the primary domain name to `api.agora.io`, and the business server resolves the primary domain name to Germany. Germany is located in central Europe (`api-eu-central-1.agora.io`). The [domain name table](#domain-name-table) shows that the adjacent area is West Europe. Use the `api-eu-west-1.agora.io` or `api-eu-west-1.sd-rtn.com` domain name to retry.


#### Precautions

Take the following precautions when setting up your retry strategy:

* To avoid exceeding the QPS limit with retry requests, best practice is to use a back-off strategy. For example, wait 1 second before you retry for the first time, wait 3 seconds before retrying the second time, and wait 6 seconds before retry a third time.

* If the request fails because of a network problem rather than a DNS domain name resolution problem, skip alternate domain retry and proceed to adjacent domain retry. 

* Before switching to the region domain name, ensure that the REST services you wish to use, for example, cloud recording or channel management, are deployed in that region.

### Domain name table

The following table shows the primary and region domain names for various regions.
