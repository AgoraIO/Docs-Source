### Development considerations

When using Fastboard's recording and playback features, note the following:

- **Recording delay**: Recording content is not generated in real time. Newly created rooms may need to wait for a period of time before the recording content becomes available.
- **Plugin consistency**: If plugins are enabled in the live room, configure the same plugins for playback. Otherwise, playback errors may occur.
- **Time range**: Set an appropriate playback time range based on your usage scenario to avoid playing unnecessary content.
- **Network buffering**: Playback may require network buffering, especially when seeking to a distant point in time.
- **Storage costs**: Prolonged use of the recording function incurs storage costs. Use it judiciously based on your business needs.
- **Resource release**: Remember to call `ui.destroy()` and `player.destroy()` to release resources after use.
