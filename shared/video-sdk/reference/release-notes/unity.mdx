### v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May 29, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Video capture (Windows, iOS)**

This release optimizes the APIs for camera and screen capture function. As of v4.2.0, ensure you use the alternative methods listed in the table below and specify the video source by setting the `sourceType` parameter:

| Deleted Methods                                              | Alternative Methods       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| <li>`StartPrimaryCameraCapture`（Windows）</li><li>`StartSecondaryCameraCapture`（Windows，iOS）</li> | `StartCameraCapture`      |
| <li>`StopPrimaryCameraCapture`（Windows）</li><li>`StopSecondaryCameraCapture`（Windows，iOS）</li> | `StopCameraCapture`       |
| <li>`StartPrimaryScreenCapture `（Windows）</li><li>`StartSecondaryScreenCapture`（Windows，iOS）</li> | `StartScreenCapture`[2/2] |
| <li>`StopPrimaryScreenCapture`（Windows）</li><li>`StopSecondaryScreenCapture`（Windows，iOS）</li> | `StopScreenCapture`[2/2]  |

**2. Video rendering**

As of v4.2.0, Agora Unity SDK does not support using `VideoSurface` and `VideoSurfaceYUV` at the same time for video rendering. After one `IRtcEngine` is created, if the first view is rendered through `VideoSurfaceYUV`, all views need to be rendered using `VideoSurfaceYUV` throughout the lifecycle of the `IRtcEngine`.

**3. Video data acquisition**

The `OnCaptureVideoFrame` and `OnPreEncodeVideoFrame` callbacks are added with a new parameter called `sourceType`, which is used to indicate the specific video source type.

**4. Channel media options**

- `PublishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `ChannelMediaOptions` is deleted. Use `PublishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `PublishTrancodedVideoTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `PublishTranscodedVideoTrack`.
- `PublishCustomAudioSourceId` in `ChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `PublishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**5. Local video mixing (Windows)**

- The `VideoInputStreams` in `LocalTranscoderConfiguration` is changed to `VideoInputStreams`.
- The `MEDIA_SOURCE_TYPE` in `TranscodingVideoStream` is changed to `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE`.

**6. Virtual sound card (macOS)**

As of v4.2.0, Agora supports third-party virtual sound cards. You can use a third-party virtual sound card as the audio input or output device for the SDK. You can use the `stateChanged` callback to see whether the current input or output device selected by the SDK is a virtual sound card.

<div class="alert info">If you set AgoraALD or Soundflower as the default input or output device when joining a channel, you will not hear audio.</div>

**7. Default video encoding resolution**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the video encoder algorithm and upgrades the default video encoding resolution from 640 × 360 to 960 × 540 to accommodate improvements in device performance and network bandwidth, providing users with a full-link HD experience in various audio and video interaction scenarios.

You can call the `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the expected video encoding resolution in the video encoding parameters configuration.

<div class="alert info">In scenarios such as 1-on-1 video calls and video group chats, the increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. For example, before this release, in a 1-on-1 video call scenario, the default aggregate resolution of subscribed video was 460,800 (640 × 360 × 2) and was billed as HD type; as of this release, the default aggregate resolution in the same scenario is 1,036,800 (960 × 540 × 2) and is billed as Full HD type.</div>

**8. Miscellaneous**

- `OnApiCallExecuted` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.

- The `IAudioFrameObserver` class is renamed to `IAudioPcmFrameSink`, thus the prototypes of the following methods are updated accordingly:
  - `OnFrame`
  - `RegisterAudioFrameObserver` [1/2] and `RegisterAudioFrameObserver`[2/2] in `IMediaPlayer`

- `EnableDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `EnableDualStreamMode`[2/2] are deprecated. Use `SetDualStreamMode`[1/2] and `SetDualStreamMode`[2/2] instead.

- `StartChannelMediaRelay`, `UpdateChannelMediaRelay`, `StartChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `UpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `StartOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`And `StartOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**1. AI Noise Suppression**

This release introduces public APIs for the AI Noise Suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise suppression mode to balance, aggressive, or low latency according to your scenarios.

<div class="alert note">Agora charges separately for this function. See [AI Noise Suppression unit pricing](pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).</div>

**2. Enhanced Virtual Background**

To increase the fun of real-time video calls and protect user privacy, this version has enhanced the Virtual Background feature. You can now set custom backgrounds of various types by calling the `EnableVirtualBackground` method, including:

- Process the background as alpha information without replacement, only separating the portrait and the background. This can be combined with the local video mixing feature to achieve a portrait-in-picture effect.
- Replace the background with various formats of local videos.

See [Virtual Background documentation](../enable-features/virtual-background).

**3. Video scenario settings**

This release introduces `SetVideoScenario` for setting the video application scene. The SDK will automatically enable the best practice strategy based on different scenes, adjusting key performance indicators to optimize video quality and improve user experience. Whether it is a formal business meeting or a casual online gathering, this feature ensures that the video quality meets the requirements.

Currently, this feature provides targeted optimizations for real-time video conferencing scenarios, including:

- Automatically activate multiple anti-weak-network technologies to enhance the capability and performance of low-quality video streams in meeting scenarios where high bitrates are required, ensuring smoothness when multiple streams are subscribed by the receiving end.
- Monitor the number of subscribers for the high-quality and low-quality video streams in real time, dynamically adjusting the configuration of the high-quality stream and dynamically enabling or disabling the low-quality stream, to save uplink bandwidth and consumption.

**4. Local video mixing**

On Windows, this release adds the `OnLocalVideoTranscoderError` callback. When there is an error in starting or updating the local video mixing, the SDK triggers this callback to report the reason for the failure.

On Android, iOS, and macOS, this release adds the local video mixing feature. You can use the `StartLocalVideoTranscoder` method to mix and render multiple video streams locally, such as camera-captured video, screen sharing streams, video files, images, etc. This allows you to achieve custom layouts and effects, making it easy to create personalized video display effects to meet various scenario requirements, such as remote meetings, live streaming, online education, while also supporting features like portrait-in-picture effect.

Additionally, the SDK provides the `UpdateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method and the `OnLocalVideoTranscoderError` callback. After enabling local video mixing, you can use the `UpdateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` method to update the video mixing configuration. Where an error occurs in starting the local video mixing or updating the configuration, you can get the reason for the failure through the `OnLocalVideoTranscoderError` callback.

<div class="alert info">Local video mixing requires more CPU resources. Therefore, Agora recommends enabling this function on devices with higher performance.</div>

**5. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `GetNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.

**6. Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `EnableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio and video frames, which can speed up the first video or audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.

**7. Video rendering tracing**

This release adds the `StartMediaRenderingTracing` and `StartMediaRenderingTracingEx` methods. The SDK starts tracing the rendering status of the video frames in the channel from the moment this method is called and reports information about the event through the `OnVideoRenderingTracingResult` callback.

Agora recommends that you use this method in conjunction with the UI settings, such as buttons and sliders, in your app. For example, call this method when the user clicks the **Join Channel** button, and then get the indicators in the video frame rendering process through the `OnVideoRenderingTracingResult` callback. This enables developers to optimize the indicators and improve the user experience.

#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `SetLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `SetLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Enhanced screen share (Android, iOS)**

This release adds the `QueryScreenCaptureCapability` method, which is used to query the screen capture capabilities of the current device. To ensure optimal screen sharing performance, particularly in enabling high frame rates like 60 fps, Agora recommends you to query the device's maximum supported frame rate using this method beforehand.

This release also adds the `SetScreenCaptureScenario` method, which is used to set the scenario type for screen sharing. The SDK automatically adjusts the smoothness and clarity of the shared screen based on the scenario type you set.

**3. Improved compatibility with audio file types (Android)**

As of v4.2.0, you can use the following methods to open files with a URI starting with `Content://` : `StartAudioMixing` [2/2], `PlayEffect` [3/3], `Open`, and `OpenWithMediaSource`.

**4. Enhanced rendering compatibility (Windows)**

This release enhances the rendering compatibility of the SDK. Issues like black screens caused by rendering failures on certain devices are fixed.

**5. Audio and video synchronization**

For custom video and audio capture scenarios, this release introduces `GetCurrentMonotonicTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Monotonic Time. By passing this value into the timestamps of audio and video frames, developers can accurately control the timing of their audio and video streams, ensuring proper synchronization.

**6. Multi-camera capture and multi-screen capture**

This release introduces `StartScreenCapture` [2/2] (PC only) and `StartCameraCapture`. By calling these methods multiple times and specifying the `sourceType` parameter, developers can start capturing video streams from multiple cameras and screens for local video mixing or multi-channel publishing. This is particularly useful for scenarios such as remote medical care and online education, where multiple cameras and displays need to be connected.

**7. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `StartOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `StartOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**8. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `CreateCustomAudioTrack` and `DestroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

**9. Super resolution (Android, iOS)**

To optimize the usability of super resolution, this release removes `EnableRemoteSuperResolution`. Super resolution no longer needs to be enabled manually. The SDK now automatically optimizes the resolution of the remote video based on the performance of the user's device.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

**Windows**

- When using Agora Media Player to play RTSP video streams, the video images sometimes appeared pixelated.
- Adding an alpha channel to an image in PNG or GIF format failed when the local client mixed video streams.
- After joining the channel, remote users saw a watermark even though the watermark was deleted.
- If a watermark was added after starting screen sharing, the watermark was not displayed on the screen.
- When joining a channel and accessing an external camera, calling `SetDevice` to specify the video capture device as the external camera did not take effect.

### v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December 20, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

This release deletes the `EnableDualStreamMode` [2/3] method and the `sourceType` parameter in `EnableDualStreamMode` [3/3], because the SDK supports enabling dual-stream mode for various video sources captured by custom capture or SDK; you no longer need to specify the video source type.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `EnableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

After successfully enabling the in-ear monitoring function, you can call `RegisterAudioFrameObserver` to register the audio observer, and the SDK triggers the `OnEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback to report the audio frame data. You can use your own audio effect processing module to preprocess the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. Agora recommends that you choose one of the following two methods to set the audio data format of the in-ear monitoring:

- Call the `SetEarMonitoringAudioFrameParameters` method to set the audio data format of in-ear monitoring. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the parameters in this method and triggers the `OnEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.
- Set the audio data format in the return value of the `GetEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the return value of the callback and triggers the `OnEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.

To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call `SetInEarMonitoringVolume`.

**2. Audio capture device test (Android)**

This release adds support for testing local audio capture devices before joining a channel. You can call `StartRecordingDeviceTest` to start the audio capture device test. After the test is complete, call the `StopPlaybackDeviceTest` method to stop the audio capture device test.

**3. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the `GetNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use. The available values are `UNKNOWN`, `DISCONNECTED`, `LAN`, `WIFI`, `2G`, `3G`, `4G`, and `5G`. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `OnNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report the current network connection type.

**4. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports the three audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; contact [support@agora.io](support@agora.io) to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Agora also supports publishers in choosing whether the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered bypass this filter mechanism and are transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios with a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reduce the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

<div class="alert info">To enable this function, contact <a href="support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

**5. Dual-stream mode**

This release optimizes the dual-stream mode. You can call `EnableDualStreamMode` and `EnableDualStreamModeEx` before and after joining a channel.

The implementation of subscribing to a low-quality video stream is expanded. The SDK enables the low-quality video stream auto mode on the sender by default (the SDK does not send low-quality video streams). Follow these steps to enable sending low-quality video streams:

1. The host at the receiving end calls `SetRemoteVideoStreamType` or `SetRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` to initiate a low-quality video stream request.
2. After receiving the application, the sender automatically switches to sending low-quality video stream mode.

If you want to modify this default behavior, you can call `SetDualStreamMode`[1/2] or `SetDualStreamMode`[2/2] and set the `mode` parameter to `DISABLE_SIMULCAST_STREAM` (never send low-quality video streams) or `ENABLE_SIMULCAST_STREAM` (always send low-quality video streams).

**6. Loopback device (Windows)**

The SDK uses the playback device as the loopback device by default. As of 4.1.0, you can specify a loopback device separately and publish the captured audio to the remote end.

- `SetLoopbackDevice`: Specifies the loopback device. If you do not want the current playback device to be the loopback device, you can call this method to specify another device as the loopback device.
- `GetLoopbackDevice`: Gets the current loopback device.
- `FollowSystemLoopbackDevice`: Whether the loopback device follows the default playback device of the system.

**7. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense-of-presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `SetZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listener experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user by calling `SetPlayerAttenuation` and `SetRemoteAudioAttenuation` respectively, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation parameter in `SetZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`. The receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `SetHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the audio experience for users with headphones.

**8. Multiple cameras for video capture (iOS)**

This release supports multi-camera video capture. You can call `EnableMultiCamera` to enable multi-camera capture mode, call `StartSecondaryCameraCapture` to start capturing video from the second camera, and then publish the captured video to the second channel.

To stop using multi-camera capture, you need to call `StopSecondaryCameraCapture` to stop the second camera capture, then call `EnableMultiCamera` and set `enabled` to `false`.

**9. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `SetHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `SetHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call setHeadphoneEQParameters to adjust the EQ.

**10. Encoded video frame observer**

This release adds the `SetRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions` and `SetRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx` methods. When you call the `RegisterVideoEncodedFrameObserver` method to register a video frame observer for the encoded video frames, the SDK subscribes to the encoded video frames by default. If you want to change the subscription options, you can call these new methods to set them.

For more information about registering video observers and subscription options, see API reference.

**11. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

To enable this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**12. Register extensions (Windows)**

This release adds the `RegisterExtension` method for registering extensions. When using a third-party extension, you need to call the extension-related APIs in the following order:

`loadExtensionProvider` -> `registerExtension` -> `setExtensionProviderProperty` -> `enableExtension`

**13. Device management (Windows,macOS)**

This release adds a series of callbacks to help you better understand the status of your audio and video devices:

- `OnVideoDeviceStateChanged`: Occurs when the status of the video device changes.
- `OnAudioDeviceStateChanged`: Occurs when the status of the audio device changes.
- `OnAudioDeviceVolumeChanged`: Occurs when the volume of an audio device or app changes.

**14. Camera capture options**

This release adds the `followEncodeDimensionRatio` member in `CameraCapturerConfiguration`, which enables you to set whether to follow the video aspect ratio already set in `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration` when capturing video with the camera.

**15. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio and video streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `MuteLocalAudioStreamEx` and `MuteLocalVideoStreamEx` methods are used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio or video stream, respectively.
- The `MuteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` and `MuteAllRemoteVideoStreamsEx` are used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio or video streams, respectively.
- The `StartRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `StartRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `UpdateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `StopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `StartChannelMediaRelayEx`, `UpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `PauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `ResumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `StopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `LeaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `LeaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**16. Video encoding preferences**

In general scenarios, the default video encoding configuration meets most requirements. For certain specific scenarios, this release adds the `advanceOptions` member in `VideoEncoderConfiguration` for advanced settings of video encoding properties:

- `compressionPreference`: The compression preferences for video encoding, which is used to select low-latency or high-quality video preferences.
- `encodingPreference`: The video encoder preference, which is used to select adaptive preference, software encoder preference, or hardware encoder video preferences.

**17. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `OnClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AUDIENCE_LATENCY_LEVEL_LOW_LATENCY` (1): Low latency.
- `AUDIENCE_LATENCY_LEVEL_ULTRA_LOW_LATENCY` (2): Ultra-low latency.

**18.** **Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (in comparison to the basic AI noise reduction in v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/>). The new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option. To experience this feature, contact support@agora.io.

#### Improvements

**1. Video information change callback**

This release optimizes the trigger logic of `OnVideoSizeChanged`, which can also be triggered and report the local video size change when `StartPreview` is called separately.

**2. First video frame rendering（Windows）**

This release speeds up the first video frame rendering time to improve the video experience.

**3. Screen sharing**

In addition to the usability enhancements detailed in the fixed issued section, this release includes a number of functional improvements to screen sharing, as follows:

**Windows**:

- New `minimizeWindow` member in `ScreenCaptureSourceInfo` to indicate whether the target window is minimized.
- New `enableHighLight`, `highLightColor`, and `highLightWidth` members in `ScreenCaptureParameters` so that you can place a border around the target window or screen when screen sharing.
- Compatibility with a greater number of mainstream apps, including WPS Office, Microsoft Office PowerPoint, Visual Studio Code, Adobe Photoshop, Windows Media Player, and Scratch.
- Compatibility with additional devices and operating systems, including: Window 8 systems, devices without discrete graphics cards, and dual graphics devices.
- Support for Ultra HD video (4K, 60 fps) on devices that meet the requirements. Agora recommends a device with an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60 GHz or better.

**macOS**:

- Compatibility with additional devices and scenarios, including dual graphics devices and screen sharing using external screens.
- Support for Ultra HD video (4K, 60 fps) on devices that meet the requirements. Agora recommends a 2021 16" M1 Macbook Pro or better.

**4. Bluetooth permissions (Android)**

To simplify integration, as of this release, you can use the SDK to enable Android users to use Bluetooth normally without adding the `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`permission.

**5. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `UpdateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_UPDATE_DEST_CHANNEL_REFUSED`(8), and you need to call the `UpdateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**6. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**7. Virtual background**

This release optimizes the virtual background algorithm. Improvements include the following:

- The boundaries of virtual backgrounds are handled in a more nuanced way and image matting is is now extremely thin.
- The stability of the virtual background is improved whether the portrait is still or moving, effectively eliminating the problem of background flickering and exceeding the range of the picture.
- More application scenarios are now supported, and a user obtains a good virtual background effect day or night, indoors or out.
- A larger variety of postures are now recognized, when half the body is motionless, the body is shaking, the hands are swinging, or there is fine finger movement. This helps to achieve a good virtual background effect in conjunction with many different gestures.

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_MEETING` scenario.
- Improves the smoothness of SDK video rendering.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.
- Reduces the CPU usage and power consumption of the local device when the host calls the `MuteLocalVideoStream` method. (Windows, macOS)

#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issues:

**Screen sharing issues**

- **macOS**

  - In screen sharing scenarios on Mac devices, when the user minimized or closed a shared application window, another window of the same application was automatically shared.
  - In screen sharing scenarios, the system volume of the local user occasionally decreased.
  - In screen sharing scenarios, the shared window of a split screen was not highlighted correctly.
  - In screen sharing scenarios, the screen seen by the remote user occasionally crashed, lagged, or displayed a black screen.
  - The uplink network quality reported by the `OnNetworkQuality` callback was inaccurate for the user who was sharing a screen.

### v<Vg k = "VSDK_LATEST_4_0_0"/>

v<Vg k = "VSDK_LATEST_4_0_0"/> was released on September 28, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

This release has optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/>. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:
- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see [Migration guide](../develop/migration-guide).

#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `IRtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `IRtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions.`

- After calling `JoinChannel` to join the first channel, call `JoinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
- You can simultaneously publish multiple sets of video streams captured by multiple cameras or screen sharing by setting `publishSecondaryCameraTrack` and `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions`. (Windows)

This release adds `CreateCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured video in the channel:

1. Create a custom video track: Call the `CreateCustomVideoTrack` method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
2. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.
3. Pushing an external video source: Call `PushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in step 2 in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
- Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**2. Ultra HD resolution (Beta) (Windows, macOS)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and now supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes.

Additionally, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 × 2160) and the frame rate to 60 fps when calling `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To experience this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./pricing">Pricing</a>.

**3. Full HD and Ultra HD resolution (Beta) (Android, iOS)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capturing, encoding, decoding and rendering. Starting from this version, it supports Full HD (FHD) and Ultra HD (UHD) video resolutions. You can set the `dimensions` parameter to 1920 × 1080 or higher resolution when calling the `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration` method. If your device does not support high resolutions, the SDK will automatically fall back to an appropriate resolution.

The UHD resolution (4K, 60 fps) is currently in beta and requires certain device performance and network bandwidth. If you want to enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.

High resolution typically means higher performance consumption. To avoid a decrease in experience due to insufficient device performance, Agora recommends that you enable FHD and UHD video resolutions on devices with better performance.

The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./pricing">Pricing</a>.

**4. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player.  You can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions:

- Plays local and online media files.
- Preloads media files.
- Changes the CDN route for playing media files according your network conditions.
- Shares the audio and video streams being played with remote users.
- Caches data when playing media files.

**5. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `ULTRA_HIGH_QUALITY_VOICE` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `SetVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**6. Spatial audio**

> **_NOTE:_** This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact [Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io).

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `UpdateSelfPosition` and `UpdateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio of the remote user.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/video-call-spatial.png)

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `UpdateSelfPosition` and `UpdatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/spatial-audio-effect.png)

**7. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS` enumeration in `AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

**8. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `JoinChannel` or `JoinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.

**9. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function through the following ways.

On Windows and macOS:

- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannel[2/2]`  to join a channel and set `publishScreenTrack`or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.
- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method after joining a channel, and then call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.

On Android and iOS:

- Call the `StartScreenCapture` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannel[2/2]`  to join a channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `true`.
- Call the `StartScreenCapture` method after joining a channel, and then call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `true`.

**10. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add the user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or in your blocklist if you do not want to subscribe to. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `IRtcEngineEx` interface.

- `SetSubscribeAudioBlacklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeAudioWhitelist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoBlacklist`：Set the video subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoWhitelist`：Set the video subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

**11. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `SetAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT` to `AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

**12. Replace video feeds with images**

This release supports replacing video feeds with images when publishing video streams. You can call the `EnableVideoImageSource` method to enable this function and choose your own images through the `options` parameter. If you disable this function, the remote users see the video feeds that you publish.

**13. Local video transcoder**

This release introduces local video transcoder with which you can locally merge multiple video streams into one. Common scenarios are as follows:

When streaming or using media push, you can merge the frames of multiple anchors into one locally.

To do this, you should merge multi-channel video streams collected locally (such as video captured by camera, screen sharing stream, video files and pictures) into one video stream. Then, release the merged stream in the channel.

You can call the `StartLocalVideoTranscoder` method to enable the local video transcoder and call the `StopLocalVideoTranscoder` method to stop the local video transcoder; After the local video transcoder is enabled, you can call `UpdateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` to update the configuration of the local video transcoder.

**14. Video device management**

A video capture device may support a variety of video formats, each of which supports a different combination of video frame width, video frame height, and frame rate.

This release introduces the `NumberOfCapabilities` and `GetCapability` method to obtain the number of video formats supported by video capture devices and the details of video frames under specified video formats. When you call the `StartPrimaryCameraCapture` or `StartSecondaryCameraCapture` method to capture video using camera, you can obtain the video with the specified video format.
The SDK will automatically select the video format for video capture equipment according to your settings in `VideoEncoderConfiguration`. In general, you don't need to use this set of new methods.

#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `SwitchChannel` in v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/> through the`LeaveChannel` and `JoinChannel `methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `SwitchChannel `method.

**2. Push external video frames**

This releases supports pushing video frames in I422 format. You can call the `PushVideoFrame` method to push such video frames to the SDK.

**3. Monitor the width and height of videos**

This adds the `OnTextureSizeModify` callback that can be used to monitor any change in the width and height of videos.

**4. Voice pitch of the local user**
This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `OnAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.

**5. Video preview**

This release improves the implementation logic of `StartPreview`. You can call the `StartPreview ` method to enable video preview at any time.

 **6. Video types of subscription**

You can call the `SetRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType ` method to choose the video stream type when subscribing streams.
