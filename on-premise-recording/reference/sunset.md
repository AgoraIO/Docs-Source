This page provides sunset plans for some Agora services. You should prepare to replace or upgrade affected solutions in a timely fashion to avoid service disruptions.

## SDKs earlier than v4.0.0

### Retirement plans

To support ongoing technical evolution and architectural improvements, Agora will begin the retirement process for the Local Server Recording SDK 1.x–3.x series. This change does not affect users of version 4.x.

The retirement schedule is as follows:

* **June 30, 2025** (exclusive):
  Agora will stop providing new features and download access for SDK versions 1.x–3.x.

* **After December 30, 2025**:
  Technical support for SDK versions 1.x–3.x will end. All associated documentation will also be taken offline.

### Upgrade solutions

The latest versions of the On-Premise Recording SDK have made significant improvements to user experience, service reliability, and security. To avoid service disruptions, upgrade the On-Premise Recording SDK that you are using as soon as possible by referring to the following information:

- [SDK download links](https://docs.agora.io/en/Recording/downloads)
- [Release notes](../overview/release-notes)

If you encounter any problems, contact [Agora](mailto:support@agora.io) for support.
