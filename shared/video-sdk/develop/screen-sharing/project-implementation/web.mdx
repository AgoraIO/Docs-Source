This section shows you how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your <Vpl k="NAME" /> project.

### Chrome browser

The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Web SDK supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Chrome version 58 and higher. Follow these steps to share your screen.

Call `createScreenVideoTrack` to create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track.

This method requires Chrome 74 or above. If you are using an older version, use the screen sharing plug-in to share the screen.

```javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
    // Configure screen sharing encoding parameters, see API documentation for details
    encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
    // Set the video transmission optimization mode to prioritize quality ("detail"), or smoothness ("motion")
    optimizationMode: "detail"
}).then(localScreenTrack => {
    /** ... **/
});
```

#### Share audio

The Web SDK supports simultaneous sharing the screen and locally played background sounds on Windows and macOS platforms with the Chrome browser version 74 and higher.

When calling the `createScreenVideoTrack` method, set the `withAudio` parameter to `enable`.

The `createScreenVideoTrack` method returns a list containing the following:

- Video track object for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
- Audio track object for local background sound playback.

``` javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
  encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
}, "enable").then(([screenVideoTrack, screenAudioTrack])=> {
  /** ... **/
});
```

<Admonition title="Note">
- After you call the method, the end user must check **Share Audio** in the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> popup box for the setting to take effect.

- If you choose to share a single app window, the audio cannot be shared.
</Admonition>

### Edge browser

<Vpd k="SDK" /> for Web supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Edge 80 and higher on the Windows 10+ platform.

To create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track, call `createScreenVideoTrack` as follows:

``` javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
  // Configure the screen sharing encoding parameters here, refer to the API documentation for details
  encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
}).then(localScreenTrack => {
  /** ... **/
});
```

### Firefox browser

<Vpd k="SDK" /> for Web supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Firefox 56 and higher. For Firefox, you specify the type of <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> by setting `screenSourceType`.

Choose one of the following values for `screenSourceType`:

- `screen`: Share the entire screen.
- `application`: Share all windows of an application (Firefox does not support this mode on Windows).
- `window`: Share a window of an application.

``` javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
  screenSourceType: 'screen' // 'screen', 'application', 'window'
}).then(localScreenTrack => { /** ... **/ });
```

### Safari browser

<Vpd k="SDK" /> for Web supports <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Safari 13 and higher on the macOS platform.

To create a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track, call `createScreenVideoTrack` as follows:

``` javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
  // Configure the screen sharing encoding parameters here, refer to the API documentation for details
  encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
}).then(localScreenTrack => {
  /** ... **/
});
```

#### Additional notes

When using <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on Safari, the entire screen is shared by default, and you cannot choose the content to share.

### Electron

For Electron, you need to draw the selection interface for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> yourself. For quick integration, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides a default selection interface.

If you use Electron v17.x or higher, add the following code to the main process to ensure that you obtain the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> source:

``` javascript
const {  ipcMain, desktopCapturer } = require("electron");

ipcMain.handle("DESKTOP_CAPTURER_GET_SOURCES", (event, opts) => desktopCapturer.getSources(opts));
```

#### Default interface

If you choose to use the default interface, there is no difference between using <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> under Electron and eb. Just call `createScreenVideoTrack` directly:

``` javascript
AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
  encoderConfig: "1080p_1",
}).then(localScreenTrack => {
  /** ... **/
});
```

The SDK provides its own default interface for end users to select a screen or window to share, as shown in the following figure:

![Electron Screen Share Default Interface](/images/video-sdk/tmp_screen-sharing-web-electron-default-interface.png)

#### Custom interface

To customize the selection interface, refer to the following steps:

1. Call the `AgoraRTC.getElectronScreenSources` method provided by the SDK to get information about the screens that can be shared. `sources` is a list of `source` objects that contain information about the sharing source and `sourceId`. Its `source` properties are as follows:

    ![Electron Screen Share Custom Interface Source Properties](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-web-electron-custom-interface-source-properties.png)

    - **`id`**: The `sourceId`.
    - **`name`**: The name of the screen source.
    - **`thumbnail`**: The snapshot of the screen source.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.getElectronScreenSources().then(sources => {
      console.log(sources);
    })
    ```

1. Based on the attributes of `source`, draw a selection interface using HTML and CSS to allow the user to select the screen source to be shared. The corresponding relationship between the properties of `source` and the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> selection interface is as follows:

    ![Electron Screen Share Custom Interface Thumbnail Name Relationship](/images/video-sdk/tmp_screen-sharing-web-electron-custom-interface-thumbnail-name.jpg)

1. Get the `sourceId` selected by the user.

1. Call the `createScreenVideoTrack` method and fill in `sourceId` with `electronScreenSourceId` to create the corresponding screen share stream.

    ``` javascript
    AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack({
      // Fill in the sourceId selected by the user
      electronScreenSourceIdï¼š sourceId,
    }).then(localScreenTrack => {
      /** ... **/
    });
    ```

##### Additional notes

- The `getElectronScreenSources` method is a wrapper around `desktopCapturer.getSources` provided by Electron, see [desktopCapturer](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/desktop-capturer) for details.
- Passing in a non-Electron `sourceId` is ignored.

### Share screen and start video simultaneously

An `AgoraRTCClient` object can only send one video track at a time. If you need to share the screen and turn on camera video capture at the same time, create two `AgoraRTCClient`s, one to send the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track and the other to send the camera track.

``` javascript
async function startScreenCall() {
  const screenClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });
  await screenClient.join("<APP_ID", "<CHANNEL>", "<TOKEN>");

  const screenTrack = await AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack();
  await screenClient.publish(screenTrack);

  return screenClient;
}

async function startVideoCall() {
  const videoClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });
  await videoClient.join("<APP_ID", "<CHANNEL>", "<TOKEN>");

  const videoTrack = await AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack();
  await videoClient.publish(videoTrack);

  return videoClient;
}

Promise.all([startScreenCall(), startVideoCall()]).then(() => { /** ... **/ });
```

Subscribing to your own track incurs additional charges, as illustrated in the following figure:

![Electron Screen Share Subscribing Yourself Additional Charges](/images/video-sdk/screen-sharing-web-electron-subscribing-yourself.svg)

- To avoid double billing, best practice is to store the `uid` returned by each client after successfully joining a channel in a list. Each time a `user-published` event is monitored, check if the track is a local track; if so, do not subscribe.
- The client sharing the screen should not subscribe to any streams.

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- An `AgoraRTCClient` object can only send one video track.
- The user ID of the user publishing <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> should not be fixed at the same value, otherwise sharing streams with the same user ID may cause mutual kicks in some scenarios.
- During <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, the client publishing the local stream should not subscribe to the local <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> track, to avoid additional billing.
- When <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> on the Windows platform, sharing the QQ chat window causes a black screen.
