In addition to transcribing the host's audio in real time, <Vpd k="NAME" /> also supports translation during transcription. For example, in an international conference use-case, you can transcribe the host's speech, translate the transcribed content, and then push both the original text and the translation back to the channel as subtitles. 

## Understand the tech

Following are the key features of real-time translation:

- **Instant translation**  
  Live speech-to-text translation to keep conversations flowing seamlessly in real-time communication or live streaming.

- **Multi-language support**  
  Manage multilingual interactions with speech translation from up to 4 source languages into 10 target languages for each source.

- **High accuracy**  
  Advanced Speech Recognition (ASR) captures spoken language and converts it accurately to text using sophisticated recognition technologies.

- **Translated captions**  
  Live captions are continually updated during speech, providing readable, translated text. Video Text Track (VTT) files can be stored in the cloud for future reference, AI analysis, or compliance.

- **Ultra-low Latency translation**  
  Seamless translation with an end-to-start latency of under 1 second and average end-to-end latency of under 3 seconds.

- **LLM integration**  
  Process transcribed text using large language models (LLMs) to generate translation text, enhancing the Quality of Experience (QoE) to match that of a native speaker. Incorporate additional AI services to improve accuracy and reduce latency.

This page shows you how to set up translation of the transcribed content when starting a transcription task.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, first implement basic speech-to-text transcription by following the [Rest quickstart](../get-started/quickstart).

## Implementation

When calling `start` to start a transcription task, set `translateConfig` to translate the transcribed text content.

### Sample request

The following example shows you how to set up translation when transcribing. The example includes the URL, header, and body. To record and encrypt at the same time in the transcription task, refer to [Record captions](../develop/record-captions) and [Encrypt captions](../develop/encrypt-captions).

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/join' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <credentials>' \
--data '{
    "name": "unique-agent-id",
    "languages": [
        "en-US"
    ],
    "maxIdleTime": 50,
    "rtcConfig": {
        "channelName": "<YourChannelName>",
        "subBotUid": "<YourSubscribeUid>",
        "pubBotUid": "<YourPublishUid>",
        "subscribeAudioUids": ["123", "456"]
    },
    "translateConfig": {
        "languages": [

                    "ar-SA",
                    "id-ID",
                    "fr-FR",
                    "ja-JP"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}'
```
