A smaller app size means quicker download and installation times, which can lead to a better user experience. This page shows you how to manually install the <Vg k="VSDK" /> and reduce the app size of the SDK integrated <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Manual installation

<Setup />

## Reduce the app size

To reduce the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size, implement the following strategies:

### Use the audio SDK
<Vg k="VSDK" /> supports both audio and video functions, and the package size is large. If you only need to use the audio features, best practice is to integrate the [Voice SDK](../../sdks).

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web,electron,unity,flutter,react-native" >
### Remove unneeded plugins
The SDK provides optional plugin dynamic libraries. The name of the plugin is suffixed with `extension`. See the [plugin list](#plugin-list) for details on the function and size of the plugins. Refer to the following ways to exclude these plugins to reduce the size of the app.

#### Manual integration
When integrating through the official SDK download link, delete the plugin files you don't need.
