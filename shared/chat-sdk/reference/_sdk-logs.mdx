If youâ€™re troubleshooting an issue with the Agora Chat SDK, Agora support team might ask you to send the SDK logs. Logs record information about events that occurred in the SDK. These include errors and warnings as well as informational events.

By default, the SDK generates three log files, `easemob.log` and two `easemob_Y-m-d_H-M-S.log` files, each with a maximum size of 2048 KB (2 MB). These log files are encoded in `UTF-8`. The SDK writes the latest logs in `easemob.log`. When `easemob.log` is full, the SDK deletes the log file generated at the earliest time, renames `easemob.log` to the name of the current time-dependent log file, and creates a new `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.
