### Other approaches to integrate the SDK

In addition to integrating the Agora Chat SDK with CocoaPods, you can also take the following steps to integrate the SDK manually:

1. Download the latest Agora Chat SDK and decompress it.

2. Copy `AgoraChat.framework` in the SDK package to the project folder. `AgoraChat.framework` contains arm64, armv7, and x86_64 instruction sets.

3. Open Xcode and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

4. Click **+ > Add Otherâ€¦ > Add Files** to add AgoraChat.framework and set the **Embed** property to **Embed & Sign**. Then the project automatically links to the required system library.
