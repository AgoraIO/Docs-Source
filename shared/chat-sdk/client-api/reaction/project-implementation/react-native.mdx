### Add a reaction

Call `addReaction` to add a reaction to the specified message. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `onMessageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (reaction ID, user ID of the user that adds the reaction, and the addition operation).

For a reaction, a user can add only once, or the error 1301 is reported for repeated addition.

```typescript
// reaction: Reaction ID
// msgId: The message ID
// Adds a reaction to the specified message
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.addReaction(reaction, msgId)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("success: ", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("fail: ", error);
  });
```

### Remove a reaction

Call `removeReaction` to remove the specified reaction. You can also listen for the reaction change in `onMessageReactionDidChange`. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `onMessageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (ID of the removed reaction, user ID of the user that removes the reaction, and the removal operation).
```typescript
// reaction: Reaction ID
// msgId: The message ID
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.removeReaction(reaction, msgId)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("success: ", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("fail: ", error);
  });
```

### Retrieve a list of reactions

Call `getReactionList` to retrieve a list of reactions of messages from the server. This method also returns the basic information of the reactions, including the content of the reaction, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and a list of the first three user IDs that added or removed the reaction.
```typescript
// msgId: The message ID
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.getReactionList(msgId)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("success: ", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("fail: ", error);
  });
```

You can also use the `reactionList` member in `ChatMessage` to quickly retrieve the reactions of the specified message.

```typescript
const msg = ChatMessage.createTextMessage(targetId, content);
msg.reactionList
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("success: ", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("fail: ", error);
  });
```

### Retrieve the details of the reaction

Call `fetchReactionDetail` to get the detailed information of the reaction from the server. The detailed information includes the reaction content, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and the complete list of user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```typescript
// reaction: Reaction ID
// msgId: The message ID
// pageSize: The number of reactions returned for each method call. The value range is [1,50]
// cursor: The position from which to get the reaction detail. Pass `null` or an empty string for the first method call.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchReactionDetail(msgId, reaction, cursor, pageSize)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("success: ", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("fail: ", error);
  });
```


### Listen for reaction status

Use `onMessageReactionDidChange` to listen for changes or status of the reaction.

```typescript
// listens for reaction updates
class ChatMessageEvent implements ChatMessageEventListener {
  onMessageReactionDidChange(_list: ChatMessageReactionEvent[]): void {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.");
  }
  // Add other callbacks according to your business logic
}
// Adds the message status listener
const listener = new ChatMessageEvent();
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.addMessageListener(listener);
// Removes the listener
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.removeMessageListener(listener);
// Removes all listeners
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.removeAllMessageListener();
```
