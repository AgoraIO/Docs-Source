## Call APIs to change connection states

You can use the state and cause for the state change returned by the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback to actively call the API to change the connection state in the following situations.

### Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />

When you call `Login` to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />, the connection state changes from `CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED` to `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTING`, and the cause for the state change is `CONNECTION_CHANGE_REASON_LOGIN`. When the state is `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTING`, the connection state automatically changes to one of the following states:

-   `CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED`: The login fails or times out (the user fails to log in within 12 seconds).

-   `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED`: The login succeeds.

When the connection state turns to CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED, you need to call `Login` again to log in.

### Disconnected from <Vg k="SIG" /> due to network problems

When the connection state is `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED`, if the connection with the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system is interrupted and cannot recover in four seconds due to network reasons, the connection state changes to `CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING`, and the cause for the state change is `CONNECTION_CHANGE_REASON_INTERRUPTED`. When in the `CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING` state, the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> continues to automatically reconnect to <Vg k="SIG" /> until the login is successful, so you do not need to perform any login operations. After successful reconnection, the connection state changes to `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED`, but the SDK does not return the `OnLoginSuccessHandler` callback.

The SDK resends messages that occurred during the disconnection period according to the following guidelines:

-   Sender
    During the reconnection period, the SDK continues to send all channel and peer-to-peer messages until the message request times out.

-   Receiver
    After the reconnection succeeds, <Vg k="SIG" /> resends all of the peer-to-peer messages sent during the disconnection period but only the channel messages from the 30-second period immediately before reconnection (up to a maximum of 32 messages) to the receiver.

If the reconnection keeps failing, the connection state remains at `CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING`. You can call `Logout` to log out of the system first, and then call the `Login` method to reconnect at an appropriate time.

<Vg k="SIG" /> responds differently per the length of time between the interruption of the connection and the successful reconnection:

-   If the user successfully logs in again within 30 seconds of the interruption, the connection state changes to the `CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED`. The user’s online state remains unchanged.

-   If the user is still offline 30 seconds after the interruption, <Vg k="SIG" /> removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `OnMemberLeftHandler` callback. If the user successfully logs in later, the connection state changes to the CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED. The SDK automatically adds the user to the previous channel, and users in the same channel receive the `OnMemberJoinedHandler` callback. Because <Vg k="SIG" /> has removed the user from the online list, the SDK will also automatically synchronize user attributes to <Vg k="SIG" />.

In the `CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING` state, the SDK keeps reconnecting to the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> system. If the token expires, the SDK returns the `OnTokenExpiredHandler` callback, which does not affect the connection state.

### Kicked out of <Vg k="SIG" />

If the same user ID logs in to <Vg k="SIG" /> from another client instance, the user who is currently connected in the client instance gets kicked out by <Vg k="SIG" />, and the connection state changes to `CONNECTION_STATE_ABORTED`. You can call `Logout` to log out of the system first, and then call the `Login` method to reconnect in an appropriate time.

### Log out of <Vg k="SIG" />

If you call `Logout` to log out of the <Vg k="MESS" /> system, the connection state changes to `CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED`. The <Vg k="MESS" /> system removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `OnMemberLeftHandler` callback.

## Sample code

Refer to the following sample code to monitor the connection state:

```c
// Monitors the connection state
  public void OnConnectionStateChangedHandler(int id, CONNECTION_STATE state, CONNECTION_CHANGE_REASON reason)
 {
    Print("OnConnectionStateChangedHandler: %d", state);
  }
```
