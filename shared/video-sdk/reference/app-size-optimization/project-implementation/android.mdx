#### Integration through Maven Central

When integrating the Android SDK through Maven Central, you can modify the `dependencies` in the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file to specify the dynamic libraries you need to integrate, and exclude the plugins you don't need. For the relationship between each file in the Android SDK and the gradle `dependencies`, see [dependency implementation](#dependency-implementation). 

Refer to the following examples to include all plugins, exclude all plugins, or to include only the specified plugins.

* If you need to use all plugins, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:4.0.1'
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-screen-sharing:4.0.1'
        ...
    }
    ```

* If you do not need to use any plugin, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:4.0.1'
        ...
    }
    ```

* If you only need to use specific plugins such as the AI ​​noise reduction plugin and Bel Canto plugin, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        def agora_sdk_version = "4.0.1"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:${agora_sdk_version}"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-ains:${agora_sdk_version}"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:audio-beauty:${agora_sdk_version}"
        ...
    }
    ```

### Dynamically Load `.so` Files

To reduce the size of the app's installation package, <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the `mNativeLibPath` attribute in the `RtcEngineConfig` class to support dynamic loading of the required `.so` files. Refer to the following steps to implement this feature:

1. Download the latest version of the SDK and decompress it.
2. Integrate `agora-rtc-sdk.jar` into your project.
3. Upload the `.so` files for all architectures to your server and make sure that the app can download the `.so` files for the target architecture over the network.
4. When the app runs, it checks for the existence of an `.so` file. If not found, it downloads the `.so` file and saves it to the private directory of the app.
5. When calling `create` to create and initialize an `RtcEngine` instance, set the `mNativeLibPath` config parameter to the app private directory where the `.so` file is located.
6. After calling `create` successfully, the SDK automatically loads the `.so` file from the specified path.

> This method is only suitable for manually integrating the Android SDK, not for integration through Maven Central.
