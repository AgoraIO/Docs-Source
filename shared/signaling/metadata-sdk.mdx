Metadata provides easy-to-use, serverless storage for user and channel data you need to build innovative, reliable,
scalable applications. Use Metadata SDK to easily store metadata about the users and channels in your app without
setting up your own databases.

Signalling triggers events when metadata is set or removed. Your app can receive these events in real
time in order to update the front-end accordingly.
