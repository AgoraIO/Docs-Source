    RESTful API error codes.

When you call the <Vg k="SIG"/> RESTful API, each response includes the following fields:

* `errorCode`: The numeric status code returned by the server.
* `reason`: A description of the error associated with the code.

This section describes the meaning of each error code, provides possible causes, and offers suggested solutions.
