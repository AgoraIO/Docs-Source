### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:pageSize:completion` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `getAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```objective-c
pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getConversationsFromServerWithCursor:@"" pageSize:20 completion:^(AgoraChatCursorResult<AgoraChatConversation *> * _Nullable result, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

You can call `fetchMessagesFromServer` based on the `FetchServerMessagesOption` class to pull message history of a one-to-one or group chat from the server. To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull 20 messages at a time, with a maximum of 50. If the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the `pageSize` value, then only the `pageSize` number of messages will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the `pageSize` value.

Using the `FetchServerMessagesOption` class, you can pull message history with the following conditions:

- message sender,
- message type,
- message time period,
- message search direction,
- whether to save the pulled messages to the database.

For group chats, you can set the `from` parameter to pull messages sent by individual members of the group.

If you toggle on the `Options#regardImportMessagesAsRead` switch during initialization, the messages imported with [RESTful API](../../restful-api/message-management#import-a-one-to-one-chat-message) and retrieved by calling this API will be in the *read* status; and the number of unread messages in the conversation (the `Conversation#unreadMessagesCount` return value) will not change. If the switch is off, the `Conversation#unreadMessagesCount` return value will increase.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note">
<ul><li>To use this API, upgrade to v1.3.0 or above.</li>
<li>By default, you can retrieve message history of one-to-one and group chats. To obtain message history of a chat room, contact support@agora.io.</li>
<li>The storage time of message history and offline messages on the server is defined by your pricing package. See [Pricing plan details](../../reference/pricing-plan-details).</li>

</Admonition>

Refer to the following code sample:

```objective-c
let option = FetchServerMessagesOption();
        Client.shared().chatManager?.fetchMessagesFromServer(by: "conversationId", conversationType: .chat, cursor: "", pageSize: 50, option: option, completion: { result, err in
            if let err = err {
                // Failed to retrieve
            } else {
                // Retrieval successful
            }
        })
```

You can also call `asyncFetchHistoryMessagesFromServer` to pull messages of a specified conversation from the server, in the chronological or reverse chronological order.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull a maximum of 50 messages at a time and do multiple iterations, if necessary. After pulling, the SDK will automatically update the message to the local database.

```objective-c
// Asynchronous method
 [[EMClient sharedClient].chatManager asyncFetchHistoryMessagesFromServer:conversation.conversationId conversationType:conversation.type startMessageId:self.moreMsgId pageSize:10 completion:^(EMCursorResult *aResult, EMError *aError) {
             [self.conversation loadMessagesStartFromId:self.moreMsgId count:10 searchDirection:EMMessageSearchDirectionUp completion:block];
          }];
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager pinConversation:@"conversationId" isPinned:YES completionBlock:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```

### Pin a message

You can call `AgoraChatManager#pinMessage:completion:` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `MessagePinInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.pinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in pinning messages.
     }
})
```

### Unpin a message

You can call `AgoraChatManager#unpinMessage:completion:` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `ChatManagerDelegate#onMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, `MessagePinInfo` is returned empty and the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.unpinMessage("messageId", completion: { message, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in unpinning messages.
    }
})
```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `AgoraChatManager#getPinnedMessagesFromServer:completion` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getPinnedMessages(fromServer: "conversationId", completion: { pinnedMessages, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in getting pinned messages from the server.
    }
})
```

### Get pinned details of a single message

You can call `AgoraChatMessagePinInfo` to get the pinned details of a single message.

- If the message is pinned, this class returns the time of pinning and the user ID of the user who has pinned it.
- If the message is not pinned, this class is returned empty.

```objective-c
if let message = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getMessageWithMessageId("messageId") {
    let pinnedInfo = message.pinnedInfo
}
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

You can use the `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp` or `removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds` method to unidirectionally delete historical messages on the server side based on message time or message ID. Up to 50 messages can be deleted at a time. Once deleted, the user cannot retrieve the message from the server. This operation does not affect other users.

Other devices logged in to the account will receive the `MultiDevicesDelegate` callback `multiDevicesMessageBeRemoved`, and the deleted messages will be automatically removed from the device locally.

```objc
// Delete messages by timestamp
[self.conversation removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp:message.timestamp completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

}];

// Delete messages by message ID
[self.conversation removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds:@[@"123314142214"] completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable aError) {

}];
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `deleteServerConversation` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on the local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```objective-c
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager deleteServerConversation:@"conversationId1" conversationType:AgoraChatConversationTypeChat isDeleteServerMessages:YES completion:^(NSString *aConversationId, AgoraChatError *aError) {

    }];
```

### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addConversationMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. You can tag up to 20 conversations at a time.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `getConversationsFromServer` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `marks` property.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.addConversationMark(["conversationId"], mark: .type0, completion: { err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in marking conversations.
    }
})
```

To use customized tags, use the following code:
```objective-c
NSDictionary* mapping = @{
        @(EMMarkType0): @"important",
        @(EMMarkType1): @"normal",
        @(EMMarkType2): @"unimportant",
        @(EMMarkType3): @"boys",
        @(EMMarkType4): @"girls",
    };
```

### Remove conversation tag

To remove a conversation tag, call `removeConversationMark`. Tags can be removed for up to 20 conversations at a time. Calling this method removes tags from both the local and server-side conversation.

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.removeConversationMark(["conversationId"], mark: .type0, completion: { err in
    if err == nil {
        // Succeeded in untagging a conversation.
    }
})
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `getConversationsFromServer` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```objective-c
AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationsFromServer(withCursor: "", filter: AgoraChatConversationFilter(mark: .type0, pageSize: 20), completion: { conversations, err in
    if err == nil {
        // Successfully retrieved conversations by tag.
    }
})
```

### Query local conversations by the conversation tag

For local conversations, you can use the `getAllConversations` method to retrieve all local conversations and then perform  filtering as needed. The following example demonstrates how to query all local conversations marked with `EMMarkType0:`

```objective-c
let markType: AgoraChatMarkType = .type0
let marked0Conversations = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getAllConversations()?.filter { $0.marks.contains(NSNumber(value: markType.rawValue))
}
```

### Get all tags of a local conversation

To retrieve all tags associated with a local conversation, first use the `getConversationWithConvId` method to obtain the local conversation. Then, access the `marks` property of the conversation object to view all its tags. Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating this process:

```objective-c
if let conversation = AgoraChatClient.shared().chatManager?.getConversationWithConvId("conversationId") {
    let marks = conversation.marks
}
```
