Implement the following real-time interaction quality statistics methods and audio or video state monitoring methods to understand user interaction experience:

- `network-quality`: Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality.
- `getRTCStats`: Reports real-time interaction statistics.
- `getLocalAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the sent audio stream.
- `getRemoteAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote audio stream.
- `getLocalVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the sent video stream.
- `getRemoteVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote video stream.

In your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, add the following code:

```javascript
// Subscribe to the "network-quality" event to receive uplink network conditions
agoraEngine.on("network-quality", (quality) => {
  console.log("Network quality:", quality);
});

// Get remote network quality
const remoteNetworkQuality = client.getRemoteNetworkQuality();

// Get local audio and video statistics
const localStats = {
  video: client.getLocalVideoStats(),
  audio: client.getLocalAudioStats()
};

// Get overall channel statistics
const rtcStats = agoraEngine.getRTCStats();
console.log("Channel statistics:", rtcStats);

// Get remote user's audio statistics using the remote UID
const remoteAudioStats = agoraEngine.getRemoteAudioStats(remoteUID);
console.log("Remote user audio statistics:", remoteAudioStats);

// Get remote user's video statistics using the remote UID
const remoteVideoStats = agoraEngine.getRemoteVideoStats(remoteUID);
console.log("Remote user video statistics:", remoteVideoStats);

```

The SDK reports abnormal events in the channel through the `AgoraRTCClient.on("exception")` callback. Unusual events are not errors, but often cause call quality issues. After an abnormal event occurs, if the situation returns to normal, you receive this callback again. 

```js
client.on("exception", function(evt) {
  console.log(evt.code, evt.msg, evt.uid);
})
```

This callback returns:

* `code`: event code.
* `msg`: Prompt message.
* `uid`: UID of the user where exception or recovery has occurred.

Each abnormal event has a corresponding recovery event, as described in the following table:

| Event code| Message and description |  Event code| Recovery message and description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1001 | `FRAMERATE_INPUT_TOO_LOW` <br/> Video capture frame rate is too low | 3001 | `FRAMERATE_INPUT_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Video capture frame rate returns to normal|
| 1002 | `FRAMERATE_SENT_TOO_LOW` <br/> Video sending bit rate is too low  | 3002 | `FRAMERATE_SENT_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Video sending frame rate returns to normal |
| 1003 | `SEND_VIDEO_BITRATE_TOO_LOW` <br/> Video sending bit rate is too low | 3003 | `SEND_VIDEO_BITRATE_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Video sending bit rate returns to normal |
| 1005 | `RECV_VIDEO_DECODE_FAILED` <br/> Receiving video decoding failed | 3005 | `RECV_VIDEO_DECODE_FAILED_RECOVER` <br/> Receiving video decoding returns to normal |
| 2001 | `AUDIO_INPUT_LEVEL_TOO_LOW` <br/> Send volume too low | 4001 | `AUDIO_INPUT_LEVEL_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Send volume back to normal |
| 2002 | `AUDIO_OUTPUT_LEVEL_TOO_LOW` <br/> Receive volume too low | 4002 | `AUDIO_OUTPUT_LEVEL_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Receiving volume returns to normal |
| 2003 | `SEND_AUDIO_BITRATE_TOO_LOW` <br/> Audio sending bit rate is too low | 4003 | `SEND_AUDIO_BITRATE_TOO_LOW_RECOVER` <br/> Audio sending bit rate returns to normal |
| 2005 | `RECV_AUDIO_DECODE_FAILED` <br/> Failed to decode received audio | 4005 | `RECV_AUDIO_DECODE_FAILED_RECOVER` <br/> Received audio decoding returns to normal |
