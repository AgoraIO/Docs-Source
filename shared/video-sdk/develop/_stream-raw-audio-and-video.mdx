In some scenarios, raw audio and video captured through the camera and microphone must be processed to achieve the desired functionality or to enhance the user experience. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to pre-process and post-process the captured audio and video data for implementation of custom playback effects.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
In Web SDK, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides extensions like <Link
  to="/video-calling/enable-features/ai-noise-suppression">AI Noise Suppression</Link>, <Link
  to="/video-calling/enable-features/virtual-background">Virtual Background</Link> and [Image enhancer](https://docs-beta.agora.io/en/video-calling/enable-features/image-enhancement) for
  pre-process and post-process phases.

## Understand the tech

You can use the raw data processing functionality in <Vg k="VSDK" /> to process the feed according to your particular scenario. This feature enables you to pre-process the captured signal before sending it to the encoder, or to post-process the decoded signal before playback. To implement processing of raw video and audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps.

- Set up video and audio frame observers.
- Register video and audio frame observers before joining a channel.
- Set the format of audio frames captured by each callback.
- Implement callbacks in the frame observers to process raw video and audio data. 
- Unregister the frame observers before you leave a channel.

The figure below shows the workflow you need to implement to process raw video and audio data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequites />

## Implement raw data processing

When a user captures or receives video and audio data, the data is available to the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> for processing before it is played. This section shows how to retrieve this data and process it, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement/>

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented raw data processing into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. **[Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />**.

2. **Configure the web demo you use to connect to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>**:

    In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg
    k="COMPANY"/> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
