Topics are a mechanism for managing transmission and distribution of data in stream channels. After joining a stream channel, users cannot publish directly to the channel. Stream channels implement message sending and receiving through topics. All subscribers of a topic receive data sent by the publishers for the topic within 100 milliseconds.

Compared to message channels, the topic mechanism in stream Channels has a higher message transmission rate, greater message concurrency, and synchronization capability with audio and video data transmission. Topics are therefore ideally suited to Metaverse, AR/VR, interactive games, real-time collaboration, and parallel control scenarios.

## Understand the tech

In <Vg k="SIG"/>, a topic is a dynamic entity that you may use at any time without the need to explicitly create it in advance. The SDK automatically creates it when the first user joins a topic. Similarly, you don't need to explicitly destroy a topic. The SDK automatically destroys it when the last user leaves.

The basic APIs for registering as a topic publisher or subscriber are join, leave, subscribe and unsubscribe.

* **Message publisher**: When you join a topic, you register as a message publisher for the topic. This enables you to send messages to topic subscribers. When you leave a topic, you unregister as a message publisher, and lose the ability to publish messages.

* **Message subscriber**: Subscribing to a topic enables you to receive messages that are published to the topic. To stop receiving topic messages, you unsubscribe from the topic.

In topics, the publisher and subscriber roles are independent of each other. This means that a user may assume the role of a publisher, subscriber, or both. One role does not affect the behavior of the other.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

* Activated stream channel capability in <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. To do so, go to **Projects** > Edit project > **All features** > **Signaling** > **Stream channel configuration** and toggle to enable.

* Integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project, and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.

* Implemented the functionality to create and join a stream channel. See [Stream channels](../core-functionality/message-channel)

## Implement topics in stream channels

This section shows you how to join, leave, subscribe, and unsubscribe from topics.

### Topic restrictions

A single client can have an unlimited number of topics at the same time, and there is no limit on the number of subscribers and publishers in each topic. However, to optimize the client-side bandwidth and performance, there are certain limits on the following:

- The number of topics that a single user can join concurrently.
- The number of topics that a user can subscribe to concurrently.
- The number of message publishers that can be concurrently subscribed to in a topic.

For details, see [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations).

### Topic naming

A topic name is a string of up to 16 letters or numbers in the ASCII character set. All topics under the same stream channel must have unique names. The same topic name in one stream channel is considered a single topic, but the same name in different stream channels is considered as two separate topics.

The following characters in topic names are supported:

- 26 lowercase English letters a-z
- 26 uppercase English letters A-Z
- 10 numbers 0-9
- Space
- `!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `(`, `)`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`, `` ` ``

<Admonition type="caution" title="Important">
  Topic names cannot begin with an underscore.
</Admonition>

The following characters are not supported:

- `.`, `*`, `/`, `\`, `\0`
- Non-printable ASCII characters

Although the <Vg k="SDK" /> does not require it, best practice when naming a topic is to use meaningful prefix characters to indicate the purpose of the topic or the type of messages published in it. Topic naming recommendations are similar to [Channel naming recommendations](../best-practices/channel-naming).
