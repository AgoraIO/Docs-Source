Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. <Vg k="COMPANY" />
uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> to join a
channel. Each token is valid for a limited period and works for specific and wildcard channel names. For example, you
use a `Agora*` token to join `AgoraChannel` or `AgoraAwesome`. However, you cannot use it to join the `AppTest`
channel.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use it to connect securely to a  <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel. You use this server for development purposes. To see how to develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns
an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel or wildcard channels.

When users attempt to connect to an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:


-   The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The [App certificate](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The name of an individual channel, or a wildcard string for multiple channels

-   The user ID of the user to be authenticated (optional)

-   The privilege of the user, either as a publisher or a subscriber

-   The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must have:

-  Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk)
-  Created a cloud platform account that is verified through your GitHub account. The following platforms are
    currently supported:
        - [Render](https://render.com/)
        - [Railway](https://railway.app/)
        - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

    To integrate a token generator directly into your security infrastructure, see [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

<PlatformWrapper platform="windows">
## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to test **secure authentication with tokens** , implement same setup as you done for the [<Vpd  k="SDK" /> quickstart project setup](../get-started/get-started-sdk#project-setup) for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.
</PlatformWrapper>

## Implement the authentication workflow

In the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> sample project, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an authentication token obtained manually from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to join a channel. In a production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

2.  [Authenticate using the SDK](#authenticate-using-the-sdk)
</ProductWrapper>

### Create and run a token server

This section shows you how to deploy a token server on a cloud platform.

1. **Start deploying the token server to your cloud platform**:

    Click your cloud platform below. The cloud platform retrieves the project code and necessary files from Github,
then takes you to the **Deployment** page.
    -   [Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service)
    -   [Railway](https://railway.app/new/template/NKYzQA?referralCode=waRWUT)
    -   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service)

1. **Fill in the information needed by your cloud platform**:

    1.  `Blueprint name`: A unique name for your deployment.

    1.  `Branch name`: The branch of the repo or fork you want to deploy, default is main.

    1.  `APP_CERTIFICATE`: The App Certificate obtained from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

    1.  `APP_ID`: The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) obtained from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

    1.  `Github account`: The GitHub account where the cloud platform should clone the token server repository.

    1.  `Repository name`: The name of the cloned repository, the default is `agora-token-service`.

    1.  `Private repository`: Select this option to hide this repository.

2.  **Create your token server**:

    Click **Deploy**. The platform configures and builds the token server.

3.  **Test your server**

    1. Click the **URL**.

        You are notified of a URL where your server is deployed. Click the link and open the token server in your
        browser. Don’t worry if you see `404 page not found` in your browser. Follow the next steps and test your server.

    1. Send a request to the token server using a URL based on the [Token server GET request structure](#token-server-get-request-structure):

        ```text
        /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
        ```

        For example: `https://agora-token-server-<your id>.onrender.com/rtc/MyChannel/1/uid/1/?expiry=300`

        Your token server returns a JSON object containing an encrypted token:

        ```json
        {"rtcToken":"ThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleToken"}
        ```

### Authenticate using the SDK

To retrieve tokens from the token server and use them to authenticate your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> using  <Vpd k="SDK" />:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test the implementation

To test the **Secure authentication with tokens** example:

1. **[Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />**.

2. **Configure the web demo you use to connect to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>**:

    In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg
    k="COMPANY"/> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.


<ProjectTest />

Your <Vpl k="PLATFORM" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> magically connects to the same channel you used in web demo. You don’t need to hardcode a token in your app; each channel is secured with a specific token, and each token is refreshed automatically. That’s pretty cool!

### Wildcard tokens

When a user joins an audio or video call, or a live broadcast, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses a token to authenticate the user. If users need to join multiple channels, or frequently switch between channels, they need to acquire a token from the authentication server each time they join a new channel. In order to avoid frequent retrieval of tokens when switching channels, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> enables use of tokens based on channel wildcards. By using wildcard tokens, users can reuse the same token to join different channels. This approach not only speeds up the process of authentication, but also reduces the workload on your token server.

#### Prerequisites

Before generating wildcard tokens, make sure you have deployed the `AccessToken2` server.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
To enable use of wildcard tokens in your web client, call `setParameter` to set `USE_NEW_TOKEN` to `true`:

    ```java
    AgoraRTC.setParameter("USE_NEW_TOKEN", true);
    ```
</PlatformWrapper>

#### Generate wildcard token

The generation code of `AccessToken2` provides two `BuildTokenWithUid` methods. You can use `BuildTokenWithUid[1/2]` or `BuildTokenWithUid[2/2]` according to the `BuildTokenWithUid` API reference, and fill in the corresponding parameter information.

When generating a wildcard token, you need to note that the following parameters are different compared to those used to generate a general token:

| Parameter | General Token | Wildcard Token |
|:----------|:--------------|:---------------|
| `uid` | User ID of the user to be authenticated. If there is no need to authenticate the user ID, that is, if clients can join the channel with any uid, set `uid` to `0`. | The user ID of the user to be authenticated. Supports `int` and `string` types for the user ID, but it must not be set to `0`. |
| `channelName` | Channel name, the length should be less than 64 bytes. | Channel name is set as wildcard `*` indicating any channel name. |

After acquiring a wildcard token, users can join any channel with the same user ID and token.

#### Precautions

1. Currently, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> supports only the following combinations of channel name and user ID when joining a channel:

    - `uid` set to 0, `channelName` is specified
    - `uid` is specified, `channelName` set to `*`

    <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> does not support setting the `uid` to `0` and `channelName` to `*` at the same time.

1. To prevent unauthorized users from disrupting the order of a channel using leaked wildcard tokens, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that users who use wildcard tokens set their permissions as a **viewer** and the role as `kRoleSubscriber`.

   If a user using a wildcard token needs to connect to the microphone, best practice is to take the following steps to update the token:

    1. Call `setClientRole` to set the user's role as a host or broadcaster.

    1. When generating a fresh token, specify the channel name and user ID in the `BuildTokenWithUid` method. Set the user permission role to `kRolePublisher`, thereby generating a token with the permission to send streams.

    1. Call `renewToken` to update the token.

1. If the wildcard token expires, you regenerate a new wildcard token on the server and then call `renewToken` to pass in the new token.
