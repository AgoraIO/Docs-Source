### Manage chat group members

1. Add users to a chat group.  
Whether a chat group is public or private, the chat group owner and chat group admins can add users to the chat group. If the `allowinvites` parameter of the group type is set to `true`, group members can also invite users to join the chat group.

2. Implement chat group invitations.  
After the user is invited to join a group, the implementation logic varies based on the setting of the group option `inviteNeedConfirm`:
   
   - If `inviteNeedConfirm` is set to `true`, there are two cases:

        * The user calls `acceptGroupJoinRequest` to accept the group invitation. After the user successfully joins the group, the inviter receives the `acceptInvite` callback and all group members receive the `memberPresence` callback.
        * The user calls `rejectGroupJoinRequest` to decline the group invitation. In this case, the inviter receives the `rejectInvite` callback.
   - If `inviteNeedConfirm` is set to false, the user is directly added to the chat group without confirming the group invitation. All group members receive the `memberPresence` callback.

3. Remove chat group members from a chat group.  
The chat group owner and chat group admins can remove chat group members from a chat group, whereas chat group members do not have this privilege. Once removed from the group, the member receives the `removeMember` callback and all the other group members receive the `memberAbsence` callback.

Refer to the following sample code to add and remove a user:

```javascript
// Group members can call inviteUsersToGroup to add users to a chat group.
let option = {
    users: ["user1", "user2"],
    groupId: "groupId"
};
connection.inviteUsersToGroup(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner and chat group admins can call removeGroupMember to remove a group member from a chat group.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    username: "username"
};
connection.removeGroupMember(option).then(res => console.log(res))
// The chat group owner and chat group admins can call removeGroupMembers to remove members from a chat group.
connection.removeGroupMembers({groupId: 'groupId', users: ['user1', 'user2']})
```


### Manage chat group ownership and admin

1. Transfer the chat group ownership.  
The chat group owner can transfer ownership to the specified chat group member. Once ownership is transferred, the original chat group owner becomes a group member. The new owner receives the `changeOwner` callback.

2. Add chat group admins.  
The chat group owner can add admins. Once added to the chat group admin list, the newly added admin and the other chat group admins receive the `setAdmin` callback.

3. Remove chat group admins.  
The chat group owner can remove admins. Once removed from the chat group admin list, the removed admin and the other chat group admins receive the `removeGroupAdmin` callback.

Refer to the following sample code to manage chat group ownership and admin:

```javascript
// The chat group owner can call changeGroupOwner to transfer ownership to the specified chat group member.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    newOwner: "username"
};
conn.changeGroupOwner(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner can call setGroupAdmin to add admins.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    username: "user"
};
conn.setGroupAdmin(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner can call removeGroupAdmin to remove admins.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    username: "user"
};
conn.removeGroupAdmin(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```


### Manage the chat group blocklist

The chat group owner and chat group admins can add or remove the specified member to the chat group blocklist. Once a chat group member is added to the blocklist, this member cannot send or receive chat group messages, nor can this member join the chat group again.

Refer to the following sample code to manage the chat group blocklist:

```javascript
// The chat group owner and admins call blockGroupMember to add the specified member to the chat group blocklist.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    usernames: ["user1", "user2"]
};
conn.blockGroupMember(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner and admins can call unblockGroupMembers to remove the specified member from the chat group blocklist.
// Once removed, the removed member can request to join the chat group again.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    username: ["user1", "user2"]
}
conn.unblockGroupMembers(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner and admins can call getGroupBlocklist to retrieve the chat group blocklist.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
};
conn.getGroupBlocklist(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```


### Manage the chat group mute list

The chat group owner and chat group admins can add or remove the specified member to the chat group mute list. Once a chat group member is added to the mute list, this member can no longer send chat group messages, not even after being added to the chat group allow list.

Refer to the following sample code to manage the chat group mute list:

```javascript
// The chat group owner and admins can call muteGroupMember to add the specified member to the chat group mute list.
// The muted member and all the other chat group admins or owner receive the muteMember callback.
// muteDuration: The mute duration. If you pass `-1`, members are muted permanently.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId"，
    username: "user",
    muteDuration: 886400000 // The mute duration. Unit: millisecond.
};
conn.muteGroupMember(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner and admins can call unmuteGroupMember to remove the specified user from the chat group mute list.
// The unmuted member and all the other chat group admins or owner receive the unmuteMember callback.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    username: "user"
};
conn.unmuteGroupMember(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner or admin can call getGroupMutelist to retrieve the chat group mute list.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId"
};
conn.getGroupMutelist(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```


### Mute and unmute all the chat group members

The chat group owner and chat group admins can mute or unmute all the chat group members. Once all the members are muted, only those in the chat group allow list can send messages in the chat group.

Unlike muting a chat group member, this kind of mute does not expire automatically after a certain period and you need to call the `enableSendGroupMsg` method to unmute all members in the chat group.

Refer to the following sample code to mute and unmute all the chat group members:

```javascript
// The chat group owner or admin can call disableSendGroupMsg to mute all the chat group members.
// Once all the members are muted, these members receive the muteAllMembers callback.
let options = {
    groupId: "groupId",
};
conn.disableSendGroupMsg(options).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat group owner or admin can call enableSendGroupMsg to unmute all the chat group members.
// Once all the members are unmuted, these members receive the unmuteAllMembers callback.
let options = {
    groupId: "groupId",
};
conn.enableSendGroupMsg(options).then(res => console.log(res))
```


### Manage the chat group allow list

The chat group owner and admins are added to the chat group allow list by default.

Members in the chat group allow list can send chat group messages even when the chat group owner or admin has muted all chat group members. However, if a member is already in the chat group mute list, this member still cannot send messages in the group even after being added to the allow list.

Refer to the following sample code to manage the chat group allow list:

```javascript
// The chat group owner or admin can call addUserToAllowlist to add the specified member to the chat group allow list.
// Once the member is added, all the other chat group admins or owner receive the addUsersToGroupAllowlist callback.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    users: ["user1", "user2"]
};
conn.addUsersToGroupAllowlist(option).then(res => console.log(res));

// The chat group owner or admin can call removeAllowlistMember to remove the specified member from the chat group list.
// Once the member is removed, all the other chat group admins or owner receive the rmUserFromGroupWhiteList callback.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    userName: "user"
}
conn.removeAllowlistMember(option).then(res => console.log(res));

// Chat group members can call isInGroupAllowlist to check whether they are in the chat group allow list.
let option = {
    groupId: "groupId",
    userName: "user"
}
conn.isInGroupAllowlist(option).then(res => console.log(res));

// The chat group owner or admin can call getGroupAllowlist to retrieve the chat group allow list.
let options = {
    groupId: "groupId"
}
conn.getGroupAllowlist(options).then(res => console.log(res));
```
