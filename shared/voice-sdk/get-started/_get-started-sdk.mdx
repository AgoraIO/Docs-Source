Real-time audio engagement immerses people in the sounds of human connections, keeping them engaged in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> longer. <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> enables you to add one-to-one or small-group voice communication with smooth, jitter-free streaming to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>'s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time audio chat into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>s. Thanks to <Vg k="COMPANY"/>'s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network ([<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />](../overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn)), you can rely on the highest available audio quality.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

![Voice Calling](/images/voice-sdk/get-started-sdk-voice.png)

To start a voice call, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. **Set the role**
    
    To both publish and subscribe to audio streams, you set the client role as *host*. Set the role as *audience*, if you only need to play audio streams published by other users.

1. **Join a channel**

    Call the method to join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel. After joining a channel, hosts can publish audio streams to the channel and subscribe to each other.

1. **Publish audio in the channel**

    Send audio stream to users in the channel.

1. **Subscribe to audio in the channel**

    Receive and play audio streams from other users in the channel.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to add <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.


## Implement a client for <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />

When a user opens the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" />. When the user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their audio is played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing <Vpd k="SDK" /> features and not the UI bells and whistles.

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

- [Downloads](../reference/downloads) shows you how to install <Vpd k="SDK" /> manually.

- To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, use a token server to generate token is recommended to ensure communication security, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow).
