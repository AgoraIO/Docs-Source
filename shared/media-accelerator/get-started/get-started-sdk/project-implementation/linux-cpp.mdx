## Implement the <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> sample project

Take the following steps to download and compile the <Vpd k="NAME"/> sample project:

1. **[Download](../../sdks) the appropriate SDK package**

    Agora provides several SDK packages configured for various architectures, operating systems, C libraries, and compilation options. The SDK package name indicates the intended platform and compilation options. For example, the name `armv7a-linux-uclibceabi` means that the SDK package is configured for the `armv7a` architecture and the Linux operating system. The compilation tool chain uses `uClibc`, and the compilation option is soft floating point. For the purpose of this document, we use the `x86_64-linux-gnu` SDK package. You may choose the package that best matches your development environment and make appropriate modifications where required.

1. **Extract the package**

    Extract the SDK package into a folder on your development machine.

1. **Navigate to the `example` folder**

    Execute the following command in the terminal. Make sure you replace `<extracted-folder>` with the path to the folder where you extracted the SDK package.
    
    ```bash
    cd <extracted-folder>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example
    ```

1. **Compile the sample project**

    In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./build-x86_64.sh
    ```
