To exclude a user from audio-strength stream selection and ensure that their stream is transmitted to the receiving end regardless of its volume, use one of the following methods:

- When calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelWithUserAccount` to join a channel, set `isAudioFilterable` to `false` in `ChannelMediaOptions` and pass the object in the `options` argument.

- After joining a channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` and set `isAudioFilterable` to `false` in `ChannelMediaOptions` and pass the object in the `options` argument.

To receive all audio streams for a particular user, without any filtering by the audio-strength stream selection feature, pull all subscribed remote audio streams. To achieve this, you call the `setParameters` method with suitable JSON options. For details, contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).
