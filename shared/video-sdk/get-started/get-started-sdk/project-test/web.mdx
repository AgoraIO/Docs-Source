Take the following steps to run and test the sample code:

1. In your `.js` file, update the values for `appId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channel` name you used to generate the token.


1. To start the development server, use the following command:
    
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal, for example, `http://localhost:5173`.

    You see the following page:

1. On a second device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) or clone the [sample project on Github](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web) to join the same channel and test the following use-cases:
 
    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves; the audience can see the host in the remote video view and hear the host.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
 - Run the web app on a local server (localhost) for testing purposes only. When deploying to a production environment, use the HTTPS protocol.
 - Due to browser security policies that restrict HTTP addresses to 127.0.0.1, the Agora Web SDK only supports HTTPS protocol and `http://localhost` (`http://127.0.0.1`). Please do not use the HTTP protocol to access your project, except for `http://localhost` (`http://127.0.0.1`).
