### Subscribe to the presence status of one or more users

By default, you do not subscribe to any users. To subscribe to the presence statuses of the specified users, you can call `subscribe`.

Once the subscription succeeds, the `completion` callback is triggered, notifying you about the current statuses of the specified users synchronously. Whenever the specified users update their presence statuses, the `presenceStatusDidChanged` callback is triggered, notifying you about the updated statuses asynchronously.

The following code sample shows how to subscribe to the presence status of one or more users:

```objc
[[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] subscribe:@[@"Alice",@"Bob"] expiry:7*24*3600 completion:^(NSArray<AgoraChatPresence *> *presences, AgoraChatError *error) {
}];
```

<div class="alert info"><ol><li>You can subscribe to a maximum of 100 users at each call. The total subscriptions of each user cannot exceeds 3,000. Once the number of subscriptions exceed the limit, the subsequent subscriptions with longer durations succeed and replace the existing subscriptions with shorter durations.</li><li>The subscription duration can be a maximum of 30 days. When the subscription to a user expires, you need subscribe to this user once again. If you subscribe to a user again before the current subscription expires, the duration is reset.</li></ol></div>


### Publish a custom presence status

You can call `publishPresenceWithDescription` to publish a custom status. Whenever your presence status updates, the users who subscribe to you receive the `presenceStatusDidChanged` callback.

The following code sample shows how to publish a custom status:

```objc
[[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] publishPresenceWithDescription:@"custom presence" completion:^(AgoraChatError *error) {
}];
```


### Listen for presence status updates

Refer to the following code sample to listen for presence status updates:

```objc
// Adds the presence status listener.
[[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] addDelegate:self delegateQueue:nil];

// Occurs when the presence statuses of the subscriptions update.
- (void) presenceStatusDidChanged:(NSArray<AgoraChatPresence*>*)presences
{
    NSLog(@"presenceStatusDidChanged:%@",presences);
}
```


### Unsubscribe from the presence status of one or more users

You can call `unsubscribe` to unsubscribe from the presence statuses of the specified users, as shown in the following code sample:

```objc
[[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] unsubscribe:@[@"Alice"] completion:^(AgoraChatError *error) {
        
}];
```

### Retrieve the list of subscriptions

You can call `fetchSubscribedMembersWithPageNum` to retrieve the list of your subscriptions in a paginated list, as shown in the following code sample:

```objc
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] fetchSubscribedMembersWithPageNum:0 pageSize:50 Completion:^(NSArray<NSString*>* members,AgoraChatError*error){
}]; 
```

### Retrieve the presence status of one or more users

You can call `fetchPresenceStatus` to retrieve the current presence statuses of the specified users without the need to subscribe to them, as shown in the following code sample:

```objc
[[AgoraChatClient sharedClient] presenceManager] fetchPresenceStatus:@[@"Alice",@"Tom"] completion:^(NSArray<AgoraChatPresence*>* presences,AgoraChatError*error){
}];
```
