The Chat SDK stores historical messages on the chat server. When a chat user logs in from a different device, you can retrieve the historical messages from the server, so that the user can also browse these messages on the new device. Additionally, the Chat SDK supports adding tags to conversation, with a maximum of 20 tags allowed per conversation.

This page introduces how to use the Chat SDK to retrieve, delete, and tag messages from the server.
