## Create and manage projects

This section shows how to create a project, view project information, and manage App Certificates in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

### Restrictions

-   If your account has multiple members, only those assigned to the teams of **Admin**, **Engineer**, or an authorized custom team have access to the **Projects** page.

-   Each <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account can create up to 20 projects. If you need to create more projects, contact <Vg k="COMPANY" /> by [submitting a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/).

### Create an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

To create a project, do the following:

1.  Open the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page.

2.  Click **Create New**.

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.

4.  Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Projects** page.

### View project information

For a project listed on the **Projects** page, you can do the following:

-   View basic information, such as the last updated and created dates, name, and security status.

-   Copy the <ProductWrapper notAllowed="broadcast-streaming" > <ProductWrapper notAllowed="on-premise-recording" > [App ID](../reference/glossary#app-id)</ProductWrapper> </ProductWrapper> <ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming"> App ID</ProductWrapper> of the project.

-   Click the pencil icon to open the project details page, where you can configure **Project Name**, copy **App Certificate** and **App ID**, and generate a **Temporary Token**.

### Manage app certificates

An App Certificate is a string generated by <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to enable token authentication. For different security requirements, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides the following app certificate options:

-   Primary Certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for temporary use or production environments.

-   Secondary Certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for production environments only and does not apply to RESTful APIs.

### Enable the Primary Certificate

For high-security scenarios, enable the Primary Certificate as follows:

-   If you choose **APP ID + Token** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, the Primary Certificate is enabled by default. On the project details page, you can click the copy icon under **Primary Certificate** to view and copy it.  In this case, you need to use the token generated by the **Primary Certificate** for authentication.

-   If you choose **APP ID** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, you need to enable the Primary Certificate manually. On the project detail page, click **Enable** under **Primary Certificate**.

    Once the Primary Certificate is enabled, you can click the copy icon to view and copy it. In this case, you can either complete authentication with the App ID only or use tokens generated by the **Primary Certificate** for authentication.

### Enable the Secondary Certificate

If you need to change the Primary Certificate after enabling it, you can enable the Secondary Certificate.

On the project detail page, click **Add a Certificate**.

The **Secondary Certificate** is now enabled.

Once the Secondary Certificate is enabled, you can click the copy icon to view and copy it. In this case, both the Primary and Secondary Certificate can be used to generate tokens for authentication.

### Switch to a new Primary Certificate

If you suspect that your primary certificate has been compromised, swap the primary certificate with the secondary certificate and delete the original primary certificate to avoid risks. Replacing the primary certificate may impact your online business. Best practice is to replace the primary certificate only when necessary. If you replace the primary certificate but do not delete the secondary certificate (the original primary certificate), the tokens previously generated using this certificate can still be used.

To switch to a new Certificate, follow these steps:

1.  [Enable the Secondary Certificate](#enable-the-secondary-certificate).

1.  On the project detail page, click the arrows icon between the Certificates to swap them.

1.  Turn off the switch next to the **Secondary Certificate** to disable it.

1.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the status of the Secondary Certificate is updated to **Disabled**, and the **Delete** icon appears.

    ![Delete Certificate](/images/common/console-delete-certificate.png)

1.  Click the **Delete** icon.

1.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the **Delete** button disappears, and the current Secondary Certificate (the original Primary Certificate) is deleted.

    <Admonition type="caution">
    Once a certificate is deleted, it cannot be restored. Before deleting the secondary certificate, make sure that most users have switched to the new certificate to avoid the following consequences:

    - All tokens generated using the deleted certificate become invalid, and users can no longer use these tokens to join channels.
    - Users who have joined the channel cannot specify new tokens through `renewToken`.
