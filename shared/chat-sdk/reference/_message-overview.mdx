In real-time messaging apps, messages are transmitted from the message sender to the message receiver. This page provides overview to the message types and message features supported by the Chat SDK.

## Message types

The Chat SDK supports the following types of messages.

### Text messages

The message content is text, including hyperlinks and emojis. The maximum data length of a text message is 3 KB.

### Image messages

Image messages are essentially attachment messages. To send an image message, you need to upload the image to the chat server. When the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically downloads the image thumbnail. The image cannot exceed 10 MB and the maximum data length of an image message is 3 KB.

### Voice messages

Voice messages are essentially attachment messages. To send a voice message, you need to upload the audio file to the chat server. When the recipient receives a voice message, the SDK automatically downloads the audio file. The voice file cannot exceed 10 MB and the maximum data length of a voice message is 3 KB.

### Video messages

Video messages are essentially attachment messages. To send a video message, you need to upload the video file to the chat server. When the recipient receives a video message, the SDK automatically downloads the video file thumbnail. To download the video file, the user needs to tap the thumbnail. The video file cannot exceed 10 MB and the maximum data length of a video message is 3 KB.

### File messages

File messages are essentially attachment messages. To send a file message, you need to upload the file to the chat server. When the recipient receives a file message, the SDK automatically downloads the file. The attachment cannot exceed 10 MB and the maximum data length of a file message is 3 KB.

### Location messages

To send location messages, you need to use a third-party map service provider to get the longitude and latitude information of the location. When the recipient receives a location message, the SDK displays the location in the third-party map service provider according to the longitude and latitude information.

### Command messages

Command messages tell the recipient to take a certain action. After receiving a command message, the recipients deal with the command themselves. You do not need to render command messages on the user interface. You can use command messages to update the avatar and nickname and synchronize this update. Command messages are not stored in the local database. The maximum data length of a command message is 3 KB.

### Extended messages

In cases where text, attachment, and location messages do not meet your business requirement, you can use extended messages. One typical use case is sending messages that quote an earlier text or image message. The data length of an extended message must not exceed that of the original message type.

### Custom messages

This is a self-defined message type. You can customize multiple message types and add a name to each type. Typical use cases are red-packet messages and template messages. The maximum data length of a custom message is 5 KB.

## Message features

The Chat SDK supports sending and receiving messages, managing historical messages, and managing message read receipts.

You can implement the following features with the chat APIs.

### Send and receive messages

All chat users can send and receive messages.
- In one-to-one chats, two users send messages to each other. 
- In chat groups, group members send and receive messages in the chat group. 
- In chat rooms, chat room members send and receive messages in the chat room.

In the scenarios above, the messages between the two users, in each chat group, and in each chat room are also known as a conversation.

### Retrieve all local conversations

The Chat SDK stores the messages that have been sent and received in the local database. You can manage these messages by retrieving all the conversations on the local device. 

### Retrieve the specified conversation

You can retrieve the messages of the specified conversation. When a user enters the conversation, this user reads all the messages in this conversation.

### Retrieve the number of unread messages

Since messages are stored with the read status, you can also retrieve the number of the unread messages in each conversation.

### Set all messages read

Once you read all the messages, the number of the unread messages are cleared. You can also clear the number of unread messages of the specified conversation or all the conversations.

### Delete conversation and historical messages

You can delete the conversations on the local device, and while doing so, you can choose whether to clear the chat history or not.

### Search messages with key words

You can search the message in a conversation using key words.

### Import messages to the database

You can import messages from third-party apps into the local database.

### Insert messages

You can insert a message to the conversation. This can be applied to use cases such as receiving a notification message.

### Retrieve conversations from the server

Apart from the local device, you can also retrieve conversations from the server. 

### Retrieve historical messages of the specified conversation

The Chat SDK stores historical messages in the chat server, and you can retrieve historical messages in each conversation from the server with pagination. The time duration for storing historical messages varies according to your pricing plan. See [Limitations of message storage duration](#limitations).

### Message delivery receipt

The SDK supports sending a message delivery receipt when the message is successfully sent.

### Message read receipt

In one-to-one chats and group chats, the SDK supports sending a message read receipt when the message receiver has read the message.
