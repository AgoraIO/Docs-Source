2. **Initialize `ContentInspectConfig`**

   Set up the inspect config inside `ContentInspectModule`. If you use a string UID to join the channel and want to receive it in the webhook callback, pass the string UID to `YourExtraInfo` inside `ContentInspectConfig`.

   For example, the following config monitors the images in a video feed, taking one frame every 5 seconds:

    ```dart
    const contentInspectModule = ContentInspectModule(
        type: ContentInspectType.contentInspectModeration,
        interval: 5,
    );
    const contentInspectConfig = ContentInspectConfig(
        modules: [contentInspectModule],
        moduleCount: 1,
        extraInfo: 'YourExtraInfo',
    );
    ```

1. **Apply `ContentInspectConfig`  to your <Vg k="ENGINE"/> instance**.

    Enable content inspect after joining a channel and after the local video is published and played.  If you need support taking screenshots for multiple video streams and uploading them, use the `enableContentInspectEx` method.

    ```dart
    var returnVal = await agoraEngine.enableContentInspect(
        enabled: true,
        config: contentInspectConfig,
    );
    ```

1. **Catch banning events**

    To know when your local user is banned from the scene, use the `connectionStateChangedTo` delegate method:

    ```kotlin
    agoraEngine.registerEventHandler(RtcEngineEventHandler(
    onConnectionStateChanged: (connection, state, reason) {
        if (state == ConnectionStateType.connectionStateFailed &&
            reason == ConnectionChangedReasonType.connectionChangedBannedByServer) {
        debugPrint('Stream banned by the server');
        }
    },
    // ...otherEvents
    ));
    ```

    This only happen if you have applied the `Kicking Server` steps above, or created your own kicking server that communicates with ActiveFence.
