<Vg k="VSDK" /> for ReactJS contains the following objects:

- Component: parts of the user interface that have their own logic and appearance. You use components to split
your UI into independently reusable pieces of code. You have function and class components.
- Hook: connect external functions such as state and life cycle methods to components.

If you are not familiar with React, see [React official documentation](https://react.dev/learn).

<Vg k="VSDK" /> for ReactJS is based on <Vg k="VSDK" /> for Web. For example, the `useLocalMicrophoneTrack`
Hook, calls <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/iagorartc.html#createmicrophoneaudiotrack">createMicrophoneAudioTrack</Link>.
