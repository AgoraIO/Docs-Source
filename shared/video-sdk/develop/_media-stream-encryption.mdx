## Secure communication with channel encryption

Media stream encryption ensures that only the users in a channel can see and hear each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive information and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires media stream encryption, {data.VSDK} provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.

This page shows you how to integrate built-in media stream encryption into your {props.CLIENT} using {data.VSDK}.

## Understand the tech

To ensure secure communication, your {props.CLIENT} uses the same SSL [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to encrypt and decrypt data in the channel. You use the key and salt to create an encryption configuration. {data.AGORA_BACKEND} uses the encryption configuration to encrypt a stream and sends it to remote users. When the remote user receives the encrypted media stream, the remote {props.CLIENT} decrypts the media stream using the same salt and key.

The following figure shows the call flow for the media stream encryption:

![Encrypt media stream](/images/others/media-stream-encryption.svg)

All users in a channel must use the same encryption configuration to initiate `agoraEngine` and enable encryption before joining a channel. If you don't have the correct configuration, you cannot decrypt channel content. Best practice is that your authentication system generates a new key and salt regularly.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

- Implemented [Get started with {props.PRODUCT}](/understand/get-started)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) latest version

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate media stream encryption into your {props.CLIENT}, you need to:



- Open the [Get started with {props.PRODUCT}] project you created previously.
- Set up [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) in your development device.
