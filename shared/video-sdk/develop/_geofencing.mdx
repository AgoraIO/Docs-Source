When a user joins a channel, <Vg k="VSDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. Agora geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for geofencing:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _Join_.
