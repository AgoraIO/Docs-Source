When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for geofencing:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

-   Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.


## Implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

### Set the geofencing configuration

Call `AgoraRTM.setArea` to specify the region to connect to. After specifying the region,  <Vpd k="SDK" /> connects
to the Agora servers within that region.
