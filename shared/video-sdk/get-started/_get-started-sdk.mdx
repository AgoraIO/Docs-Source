Real-time video immerses people in the sights and sounds of human connections, keeping them engaged in your {props.CLIENT} longer.

<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
{props.PRODUCT} enables one-to-one or small-group video chat connections with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. {data.COMPANY}’s {data.VSDK} makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native {props.CLIENT}s.
</ProductWrapper>


<ProductWrapper notAllowed="video-calling">
{props.PRODUCT} enables you to host large-scale live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. {data.COMPANY}’s {data.VSDK} makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native {props.CLIENT}s.`
</ProductWrapper>

Thanks to {data.COMPANY}’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network (SD-RTN™), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency {props.PRODUCT} features into your {props.CLIENT} using {data.VSDK}.

## Understand the tech

This section explains how you can integrate {props.PRODUCT} features into your {props.CLIENT}. The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate this feature into your {props.CLIENT}.

In an {props.PRODUCT} event, hosts stream a video feed to an audience. For example, when a CEO is giving a speech to the company employees, the CEO does not need to see all members of the audience. To represent this in your {props.CLIENT}, when you join as a host, the local feed is started and  you see your own video feed. When you join as a member of the audience, you see the host's video feed.
</ProductWrapper>


To start a session, implement the following steps in your {props.CLIENT}:

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="video-calling">
- *Set the channel profile and role*
  For hosts, set the channel profile to `LIVE_BROADCASTING` and their role to `BROADCASTER`. For audience members, set the role to `AUDIENCE`.
</ProductWrapper>

- *Retrieve a token*
  A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your {props.CLIENT} joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your {props.CLIENT} retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.

- *Join a channel*
  Call methods to create and join a channel; {props.CLIENT}s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="video-calling">
- *Host publishes local video and audio to the channel*
  A live streaming event has one or more hosts. Each host can publish their local video to the channel.
- *Audience subscribes to video and audio published by the hosts to the channel*.
  Audience members view content published by hosts to the channel.
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
- Send and receive video and audio in the channel*
  All users send and receive video and audio streams from all users in the channel.
</ProductWrapper>

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />


## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate {props.PRODUCT} into your {props.CLIENT}, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to add {props.PRODUCT} features to your {props.CLIENT}.


## Implement a client for {props.PRODUCT}

When a user opens the {props.CLIENT}, you initialize {data.ENGINE}. When the user taps a button, the {props.CLIENT} joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the {props.CLIENT}. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing {data.COMPANY} features and not UX bells and whistles.

This section shows how to use the {data.VSDK} to implement {props.PRODUCT} into your {props.CLIENT}, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented {props.PRODUCT} in your {props.CLIENT}:

1. [Generate a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All#generate-a-temporary-token) in Agora Console.

2. In your browser, navigate to the [{props.company} web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _Join_.
