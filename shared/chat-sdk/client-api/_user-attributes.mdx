After joining a <Vg k="CHAT"/> channel, a user can update information such as the nickname, avatar, age, and mobile phone number as needed. These are known as user attributes.

This page shows how to use the <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> to implement managing user attributes.

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>User attributes are stored on the <Vg k="CHAT"/> server. If you have security concerns, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends that you manage user attributes yourself.</li><li>To ensure information security, app users can only modify their own user attributes. Only app admins can modify the user attributes of other users.</li></ul></div>

## Understand the tech

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have integrated the <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/>, initialized the SDK and implemented the functionality of registering accounts and login. For details, see <Link to="/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="CHAT"/> <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>.
- Have a thorough understanding of the API call frequency limit, the maximum size of all the attributes of a specified user, and the maximum size of all user attributes in an app. For details, see [Known limitations](../reference/limitations).

## Implementation

This section shows how to manage user attributes and contacts with the methods provided by the <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/>.
