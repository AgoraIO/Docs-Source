<PlatformWrapper platform="react-native">

1. **Setup a React Native environment for <Vpd k="NAME"/> project**

    In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx react-native init ProjectName
    ```

    A new directory named `ProjectName` will be created with a boilerplate project. If your target platform is android and you're using a Windows machine, create a new file in the `android` folder of your project named `local.properties` and add the following lines to it:

    ```bash
    sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk
    ```
    Replace `Username` with your PC username.

1. **Test the setup**

    Launch your Android or iOS simulator and run your project by executing the following command:

    1. Run `npx react-native start` in the root of your project to start Metro.
    1. Open another terminal in the root of your project and run `npx react-native run-android` to start the Android app, or run `npx react-native run-ios` to start the iOS app.

    If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android or iOS simulator shortly. You can also run your project on a physical Android or iOS device. For detailed instructions, see [Running on device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).

1. **Integrate the SDK**

    1. This section describes how to integrate the SDK on React Native 0.60.0 or later. Install the latest version of the Agora React Native SDK:

        Method one: Install the SDK using npm

        ```bash
        npm i --save react-native-agora-rtc-ng
        ```

        Method two: Install the SDK using yarn

        ```bash
        // Install yarn.
        npm install -g yarn
        // Download the Agora React Native SDK using yarn.
        yarn add react-native-agora-rtc-ng
        ```

        Do not link native modules manually, as React Native 0.60.0 and later support automatically linking native modules. For details, see [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/main/docs/autolinking.md).

    1. If your target platform is iOS, you also need to run the following command to install the SDK:

        ```bash
        npx pod-install
        ```

        Ensure that you have already installed CocoaPods before performing this step. See [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

    1. The Agora React Native SDK uses Swift in native modules, and therefore your project must support compiling Swift. Otherwise, you will get errors when building the iOS app.
        1. Open `ios/ProjectName.xcworkspace` with Xcode.
        1. Click File > New > File, select iOS > Swift File, and then click Next > Create to create a new `File.swift` file.

1. **Add TypeScript**

    The sample code in this article is written in TypeScript. If you want to use this sample code directly, you need to add support for TypeScript to your project.

    1. Run one of the following commands in the root of your project to add TypeScript dependencies:

        Method one: Using npm

        ```bash
        npm install --save-dev typescript @types/jest @types/react @types/react-native @types/react-test-renderer
        ```

        Method two: Using yarn

        ```bash
        yarn add --dev typescript @types/jest @types/react @types/react-native @types/react-test-renderer
        ```


    1. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project, and copy the following code to the file:

        ```json
        {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "allowJs": true,
            "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
            "esModuleInterop": true,
            "isolatedModules": true,
            "jsx": "react",
            "lib": ["es6"],
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "noEmit": true,
            "strict": true,
            "target": "esnext"
            },
        "exclude": [
            "node_modules",
            "babel.config.js",
            "metro.config.js",
            "jest.config.js"
            ]
        }
        ```

    1. Create a `jest.config.js` file in the root of your project, and copy the following code to the file:

        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
            preset: 'react-native',
            moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node']
        };
        ```

    1. Rename `App.js` to `App.tsx`.
