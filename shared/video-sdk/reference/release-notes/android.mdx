<PlatformWrapper platform="android">

If your target platform is Android 12 or higher, add the `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of the Android project to enable the Bluetooth function of the Android system.

## v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on February 8, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the video encoder algorithm and upgrades the default video encoding resolution from 640 × 360 to 960 × 540 to accommodate improvements in device performance and network bandwidth, providing users with a full-link HD experience in various audio and video interaction scenarios.

Call the `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to set the expected video encoding resolution in the video encoding parameters configuration.

<div class="alert note">The increase in the default resolution affects the aggregate resolution and thus the billing rate. See <a href="./pricing">Pricing</a>.</div>

#### New features

**1. Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio and video frames, which can speed up the first video or audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.

**2. Video rendering tracing**

This release adds the `startMediaRenderingTracing` and `startMediaRenderingTracingEx` methods. The SDK starts tracing the rendering status of the video frames in the channel from the moment this method is called and reports information about the event through the `onVideoRenderingTracingResult` callback.

Agora recommends that you use this method in conjunction with the UI settings, such as buttons and sliders, in your app. For example, call this method when the user clicks **Join Channel** and then get the indicators in the video frame rendering process through the `onVideoRenderingTracingResult` callback.
This enables developers to optimize the indicators and improve the user experience.

#### Improvements

**1. Video frame observer**

As of this release, the SDK optimizes the `onRenderVideoFrame` callback, and the meaning of the return value is different depending on the video processing mode:

- When the video processing mode is `PROCESS_MODE_READ_ONLY`, the return value is reserved for future use.
- When the video processing mode is `PROCESS_MODE_READ_WRITE`, the SDK receives the video frame when the return value is `true`. The video frame is discarded when the return value is `false`.

**2. Super resolution**

This release improves the performance of super resolution. To optimize the usability of super resolution, this release removes `enableRemoteSuperResolution`. Super resolution no longer needs to be enabled manually.
The SDK now automatically optimizes the resolution of the remote video based on the performance of the user's device.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issues:

- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.
- Crashes occurred after users set the video resolution as 3840 × 2160 and started CDN streaming on Xiaomi Redmi 9A devices.
- In real-time chorus scenarios, remote users heard noises and echoes when an OPPO R11 device joined the channel in loudspeaker mode.
- When the playback of the local music finished, the `onAudioMixingFinished` callback was not properly triggered.
- When using a video frame observer, the first video frame was occasionally missed on the receiver's end.
- When sharing screens in scenarios involving multiple channels, remote users occasionally saw black screens.
- Switching to the rear camera with the virtual background enabled occasionally caused the background to be inverted.
- When there were multiple video streams in a channel, calling some video enhancement APIs occasionally failed.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableInstantMediaRendering`
- `startMediaRenderingTracing`
- `startMediaRenderingTracingEx`
- `onVideoRenderingTracingResult`
- `MEDIA_RENDER_TRACE_EVENT`
- `VideoRenderingTracingInfo`

**Deleted**

- `enableRemoteSuperResolution`
- `superResolutionType` in `RemoteVideoStats`

## v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December 15, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.

**2. Encoded video frame observer**

This release adds the `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptions` and `setRemoteVideoSubscriptionOptionsEx` methods. When you call the `registerVideoEncodedFrameObserver` method to register a video frame observer for the encoded video frames, the SDK subscribes to the encoded video frames by default. If you want to change the subscription options, you can call these new methods to set them.

For more information about registering video observers and subscription options, see the [API reference](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/android/4.x/API/class_irtcengine.html#api_imediaengine_registervideoframeobserver).

**3. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

> To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:sales-us@agora.io">sales-us@agora.io</a>.

**4. Camera capture options**

This release adds the `followEncodeDimensionRatio` member in `CameraCapturerConfiguration`, which enables you to set whether to follow the video aspect ratio already set in `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` when capturing video with the camera.

**5. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio and video streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` and `muteLocalVideoStreamEx` methods are used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio or video stream, respectively.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` and `muteAllRemoteVideoStreamsEx` are used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio or video streams, respectively.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `leaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `leaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**6. Video encoding preferences**

In general scenarios, the default video encoding configuration meets most requirements. For certain specific scenarios, this release adds the `advanceOptions` member in `VideoEncoderConfiguration` for advanced settings of video encoding properties:

- `compressionPreference`: The compression preferences for video encoding, which is used to select low-latency or high-quality video preferences.
- `encodingPreference`: The video encoder preference, which is used to select adaptive preference, software encoder preference, or hardware encoder video preferences.

**7. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `onClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AUDIENCE_LATENCY_LEVEL_LOW_LATENCY` (1): Low latency.
- `AUDIENCE_LATENCY_LEVEL_ULTRA_LOW_LATENCY` (2): Ultra-low latency.

#### Improvements

**1. Bluetooth permissions**

To simplify integration, as of this release, you can use the SDK to enable Android users to use Bluetooth normally without adding the `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission.

**2. CDN streaming**

To improve user experience during CDN streaming, when your camera does not support the video resolution you set when streaming, the SDK automatically adjusts the resolution to the closest value that is supported by your camera and has the same aspect ratio as the original video resolution you set. The actual video resolution used by the SDK for streaming can be obtained through the `onDirectCdnStreamingStats` callback.

**3. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_UPDATE_DEST_CHANNEL_REFUSED`(8), and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**4. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**5. Virtual background**

This release optimizes the virtual background algorithm. Improvements include the following:

- The boundaries of virtual backgrounds are handled in a more nuanced way and image matting is is now extremely thin.
- The stability of the virtual background is improved whether the portrait is still or moving, effectively eliminating the problem of background flickering and exceeding the range of the picture.
- More application scenarios are now supported, and a user obtains a good virtual background effect day or night, indoors or out.
- A larger variety of postures are now recognized, when half the body is motionless, the body is shaking, the hands are swinging, or there is fine finger movement. This helps to achieve a good virtual background effect in conjunction with many different gestures.


**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_MEETING` scenario.
- Improves the smoothness of SDK video rendering.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
- When entering a live streaming room that has been played for a long time as an audience, the time for the first frame to be rendered was shortened.

## v4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

This release deletes the `sourceType` parameter in `enableDualStreamMode` [3/3] and `enableDualStreamModeEx`, and the `enableDualStreamMode` [2/3] method, because the SDK supports enabling dual-stream mode for various video sources captured by custom capture or SDK, you don't need to specify the video source type any more.


#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback to set the audio data format of the in-ear monitoring. You can use your own audio effect processing module to pre-process the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. After calling `registerAudioFrameObserver` to register the audio observer, set the audio data format in the return value of the `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the return value of the callback, and triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.

**2. Audio capture device test**

This release adds support for testing local audio capture devices before joining channel. You can call `startRecordingDeviceTest` to start the audio capture device test. After the test is complete, call the `stopPlaybackDeviceTest` method to stop the audio capture device test.

**3. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the `getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use, including UNKNOWN, DISCONNECTED, LAN, WIFI, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `onNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report the current network connection type.


**4. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports 3 audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; you can contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Meanwhile, Agora supports publishers to choose whether or not the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered will bypass this filter mechanism and transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios where there are a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reducing the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

To enable this function, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**5. Dual-stream mode**

This release optimizes the dual-stream mode, you can call `enableDualStreamMode` and `enableDualStreamModeEx` before and after joining a channel.

The implementation of subscribing low-quality video stream is expanded. The SDK enables the low-quality video stream auto mode on the sender by default (the SDK does not send low-quality video streams), you can follow these steps to enable sending low-quality video streams:

1. The host at the receiving end calls `setRemoteVideoStreamType` or `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` to initiate a low-quality video stream request.
2. After receiving the application, the sender automatically switches to sending low-quality video stream mode.

If you want to modify the default behavior above, you can call `setDualStreamMode` [1/2] or `setDualStreamMode` [2/2] and set the `mode` parameter to `DISABLE_SIMULCAST_STREAM` (always do not send low-quality video streams) or `ENABLE_SIMULCAST_STREAM` (always send low-quality video streams).

**6. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense of presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listner experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user, respectively, by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation paramter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`, and the receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the hearing of the headphones.

#### Improvements

**1. Video information change callback**

This release optimizes the trigger logic of `onVideoSizeChanged`, which can also be triggered and report the local video size change when `startPreview` is called separately.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues.

1. When calling `setVideoEncoderConfigurationEx` in the channel to increase the resolution of the video, it occasionally failed. 
2. In online meeting scenarios, the local user and the remote user might not hear each other after the local user is interrupted by a call.
3. After calling `setCloudProxy` to set the cloud proxy, calling `joinChannelEx` to join multiple channels failed.
4. When using the Agora media player to play videos, after you play and pause the video, and then call the seek method to specify a new position for playback, the video image might remain unchanged; if you call the resume method to resume playback, the video might be played in a speed faster than the original one. 

#### API changes

**Added**

- `getEarMonitoringAudioParams`
- `startRecordingDeviceTest`
- `stopRecordingDeviceTest`
- `getNetworkType`
- `isAudioFilterable` in the `ChannelMediaOptions`
- `setDualStreamMode` [1/2]
- `setDualStreamMode` [2/2]

- `enableDualStreamMode` [3/3]

- `enableDualStreamModeEx`

  

**Deprecated**

- `startEchoTest` [2/3]

**Deleted**

- `enableDualStreamMode` [2/3] 

## v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on September 15, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

This release has optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v3.7.x. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Custom video capture and rendering (Media IO)
- Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see [Migrate from v3.7.x to v4.0.0](../develop/migration-guide).

**2. Callback exception handling**

To facilitate troubleshooting, as of this release, the SDK no longer catches exceptions that are thrown by your own code implementation when triggering callbacks in the `IRtcEngineEventHandler` class. You need to catch and handle the exceptions yourself; otherwise, it can cause a crash.

#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `RtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions.`

After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.

Besides, this release adds `createCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured videos in the channel:

1. Create a custom video track: Call this method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
2. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.
3. Pushing an external video source: Call `pushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in **step 2** in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
- Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**2. Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and now supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes.

Additionally, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 × 2160) and the frame rate to 60 fps when calling `setVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To enable this feature, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

**3. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

**4. Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

The SDK supports a new version of Noise Suppression (in comparison to the basic Noise Suppression in v3.7.x). The new AI Noise Suppression has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option. To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io).

**5. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `ULTRA_HIGH_QUALITY_VOICE` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**6. Spatial audio**

This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io). Contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the remote user.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/video-call-spatial.png)

You can also set the spatial audio for the media player as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `ILocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/spatial-audio-effect.png)


**7. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS` enumeration. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

**8. Extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace**

In order to enhance the real-time audio and video interactive activities based on the Agora SDK, this release supports the one-stop solution for the extensions from the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.APP_ID_LINK}}/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/">Agora extensions marketplace</Link>:

- Easy to integrate: The integration of modular functions can be achieved simply by calling an API, and the integration efficiency is improved by nearly 95%.
- Extensibility design: The modular and extensible SDK design style endows the Agora SDK with good extensibility, which enables developers to quickly build real-time interactive apps based on the Agora extensions marketplace ecosystem.
- Build an ecosystem: A community of real-time audio and video apps has developed that can accommodate a wide range of developers, offering a variety of extension combinations. After integrating the extensions, developers can build richer real-time interactive functions. For details, see [Use an Extension](../develop/use-an-extension).
- Become a vendor: Vendors can integrate their products with Agora SDK in the form of extensions, display and publish them in the Agora extensions marketplace, and build a real-time interactive ecosystem for developers together with Agora. For details on how to develop and publish extensions, see [Become a Vendor](/extensions-marketplace/get-started/quickstart-implement).

**9. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.

**10. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function in the following ways.

- Call the `startScreenCapture` method before joining a channel, and then call `joinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `true`.
- Call the `startScreenCapture` method after joining a channel, and then call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `true`.

**11. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blocklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `RtcEngineEx` interface:

- `setSubscribeAudioBlacklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeAudioWhitelist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.
- `setSubscribeVideoBlacklist`：Set the video subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeVideoWhitelist`：Set the video subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and a allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

**12. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `setAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT` to `AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannel` in v3.7.x through the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `switchChannel` method.

**2. Push external video frames**

This releases supports pushing video frames in I422 format. You can call the `pushExternalVideoFrame` [1/2] method to push such video frames to the SDK.

**3. Voice pitch of the local user**
This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.

**4. Device permission management**

This release adds the `onPermissionError` method, which is automatically reported when the audio capture device or camera does not obtain the appropriate permission. You can enable the corresponding device permission according to the prompt of the callback.

**5. Video preview**

This release improves the implementation logic of `startPreview`. You can call the `startPreview` method to enable video preview at any time.

 **6. Video types of subscription**

You can call the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method to choose the video stream type when subscribing to streams.
