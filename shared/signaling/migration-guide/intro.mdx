<Admonition type="info">
<Vg k="SIG" /> version `2.x` differs from `1.x` in the support of naming character sets. For example, `2.x` does not support channel names, user names, or topic names that start with `_` or contain `.` characters. When upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x` or using both versions together, be aware of possible incompatibilities caused by character set differences. Best practice is to use the character set supported by `2.x` when migrating. See [Channel naming ](/signaling/get-started/channel-basics#channel-naming) for the character set supported by `2.x`.
