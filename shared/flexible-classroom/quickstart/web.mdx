* Installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Project setup
To set up and run your <Vg k="FC" /> project, you need the following tools: 

* `Node.js` JavaScript runtime environment for building and running the web project.
* `yarn`: A package manager.
* `Lerna`: A build system for managing and publishing multiple JavaScript/TypeScript packages.
* `nvm`: (Optional) Version management command-line tool for `Node.js`.

### Install the development tools

To prepare your development environment:

1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download/) and install `Node.js`. Agora recommends using `Node.js` `14` or later.

1. Install Yarn:

   - If you have `Node.js` `16.10` or later, you can directly enable `yarn` with the following command:

      ```bash
      corepack enable
      ```

   - If you have a version of `Node.js` earlier than 16.10, you need to install `corepack` first and then enable `yarn` with the following command:

      ```bash
      npm i -g corepack enable
      ```

1. To install `lerna`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn add global lerna
   ```

1. (Optional) To install `nvm`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
   ```

### Download the source code


  To set up your <Vg k="FC" /> project:


1. Clone the repository locally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop.git
   ```

1. After the download is complete, navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd flexible-classroom-desktop
   ```

1. Best practice is to switch to the latest release.

    To switch to the branch for version `2.8.13`, run the command:

    ```bash
    git checkout release/2.8.13
    ```

1. Pull the sub-modules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-classroom-sdk
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-proctor-sdk
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-plugin-gallery
    ```

## Implement a Flexible Classroom

Follow these steps to launch a <Vg k="FC" />:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `Flexible-Classroom-Desktop` folder. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

1. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

1. Rename the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory to `.env`:

   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

1. Copy the App ID and App Certificate from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and update the corresponding parameters in the `.env` file:

   ```javascript
   REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID={your appid}
   REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE={your app certificate}
   ```

   To facilitate your testing, the `Flexible-Classroom-Desktop` project contains a <Vg k="MESS" /> Token generator, which can generate a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> Token with the App ID and App Certificate you provide. When your project goes live, you must deploy a <Vg k="MESS" /> Token generator on your server to ensure security.

1. Run the following command to launch the web client in development mode:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Test your implementation

1. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You see the login page of <Vg k="FC" />. 

1. To join a classroom, type in a room name and user name. Select a class type, set the user role to `Teacher` and then press **Enter**. 

   You are logged in to <Vg k="FC" />.

1. Install <Vg k="FC" /> on a second device. Login with the same credentials but this time set the user role to `Student`.

1. The `Teacher` and `Student` can now interact and communicate using <Vg k="FC" /> features.
