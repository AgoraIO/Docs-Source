After logging in to Chat, users can send the following types of messages to a peer user, a chat group, or a chat room:

- Text messages, including hyperlinks and emojis.
- Attachment messages, including image, voice, video, and file messages.
- Location messages.
- CMD messages.
- Extended messages.
- Custom messages.

The Chat message feature is language agnostic. End users can send messages in any language, as long as their devices support input in that language. 

In addition to sending messages, users can also forward one or more messages. When forwarding multiple messages, users have the following options:

* Forward messages one-by-one 
* Forward consolidated messages as message history

This page shows how to implement sending, receiving, forwarding multiple messages, and modifying sent messages using the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

<Understand />

**Forward multiple messages​**

<Vpd k="SDK" /> provides client APIs for forwarding multiple messages. Supported types for forwarded messages include text, images, audio & video files, attachment, and custom messages. When a user receives a consolidated message with multiple forwarded messages, they can forward this message again, thus creating a layered message. This action can be performed up to 10 times. For further details see [Multiple messages forwarding limitations](../../reference/limitations#multiple-messages-forwarding-limitations).

**Modify sent messages​**

<Vpd k="SDK" /> provides client APIs that enable end users to edit messages after sending. Every end user or chat group member may edit messages that they have sent. The original message is recalled and a new messages is sent after editing. Once a message is recalled, it is purged from the message history stored on Agora's Chat servers. An edited message contains the following information:

* The operator ID of the user performing the action.
* The operation time that indicates when the message was recalled and edited.
* The number of times a recalled message was edited (up to 5 times).
* The content of the most recent message. 

For further details see [Sent message modification limitations](../../reference/limitations#sent-message-modification-limitations).


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- You have integrated the Chat SDK, initialized the SDK, and implemented the functionality of registering accounts and login. For details, see <Link to="/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-sdk">Chat <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>. 

    Use <Vpd k="SDK" /> 1.2 or higher if you intend to enable users to forward multiple messages, or to modify sent messages.

- You understand the API call frequency limits as described in [Limitations](/agora-chat/reference/limitations).

## Implementation

This section shows how to implement sending and receiving the various types of messages.
