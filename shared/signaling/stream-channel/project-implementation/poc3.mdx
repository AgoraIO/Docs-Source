### Setup an event listener
</PlatformWrapper>

    Keep track of the users who join and leave topics, and events in the topic. In this implementation, we use the event listener we implemented in the [SDK quickstart](/en/signaling/develop/get-started-sdk#handle-events).

### Join and leave a stream channel

    To create a new stream channel, call `createStreamChannel`. When you join the channel, you configure the features you will use. 

    <JoinLeaveChannel/>

    <a id="topics"></a>

### Join and leave a topic <a name='topic'></a>

    A topic is a data stream management mechanism in stream channels. Users join, leave, subscribe, and unsubscribe to topics. You join a topic to publish and receive messages sent to all users in the topic. You subscribe to listen to messages sent by publishers only. When a user joins or leaves a topic, <Vg k="MESS"/> triggers an topic event notification. Users in the channel receive the notifications in real time. You use topic events to track changes in topic status. To join a topic:

    <JoinLeaveTopic/>

    There is no limit to the number of subscribers and publishers in each topic. However, there are limitations to the [number of topics and messages a user can subscribe to](/en/signaling/reference/limitations).

### Publish messages to a topic

    Messages are transmitted through the topic. After your user has joined a topic in a channel, you publish messages to the topic. Publishers and subscribers receive the messages. To send a message:

    <PublishMessage/>

### Subscribe to a topic

    To receive messages published to a topic, you subscribe to the topic. To subscribe:

    <SubscribeTopic/>
