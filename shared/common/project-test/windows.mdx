3. **Set the APP ID**

    In `video-sdk-samples-windows/config.json`, set `appId` to the [AppID](../reference/manage-agora-account?platform=android#get-the-app-id) of your project.

4. **Set the authentication method**

    Choose one of the following authentication methods:

    - **Temporary token**:
        1. Set `rtcToken`  with the value of your [temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token).
        1. Set `channelName` - with the name of a channel you used to create the token.
    - **Authentication server**:
        1. Setup an [Authentication server](../get-started/authentication-workflow?platform#create-and-run-a-token-server)
        1. In `config.json`, set:
           - `channelName` with the name of a channel you want to join.
           - `rtcToken` to an empty string.
           - `serverUrl` to the base URL of your authentication server. For example, `https://agora-token-service-production-1234.up.railway.app`.

5.  **Run the <Vpl k="NAME" /> sample**

    1. Double click on `<root>/agora_manager/agora_manager.sln`. It will open the solution in Visual Studio.
    
    1. Select the project you want to run in solution explorer, right click and `set as startup project'
