### User

Users are the initiators of behavior in Flexible Classroom. A user has the following properties:

- The user ID: The globally unique identifier of a user in Flexible Classroom.
- The user name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a nickname, Chinese name, or English name.
- The user role: Users have different roles in a classroom, such as the teacher, student, teaching assistant, and audience.
- Customized user properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize user properties, such as setting the user avatar or gender.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method.

### Room

Rooms in Flexible Classroom are just like the physical classrooms in schools. Classes offered by different teachers with diversified teaching materials can take place in the same room at different times. A school can have different types of classrooms, such as traditional classrooms, laboratories, and multimedia classrooms. Similarly, the rooms of Flexible Classroom can be divided into several types. A room has the following properties:

- The room ID: The globally unique identifier of a room.
- The room name: This property is only used for display in a classroom. It can be set as a Chinese name or an English name.
- The room type: Agora supports three room types: One-to-one Classroom, Small Classroom, and Lecture Hall. These room types vary in features and the upper limit on th number of users.
- Customized room properties: In addition to the above properties, developers are free to customize room properties, such as setting the room status and room label.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. A room is created automatically with the parameters (the room ID, room name, and room type) set by the first user joining the room. To join the same room with the first user, users need to call the `launch` method and pass in the same parameters (room ID, room name, and room type). Agora automatically destroys the room one hour after all users leave the room.

### Class

Classes in Flexible Classroom are just like the actual classes offered by different teachers in offline teaching scenarios. A class has the following properties:

- The class state: A class has three states: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Ended".
- The start time: The start time of a class. Before the start time, the class state is "Not Started". After the start time, the class state changes to "In Progress".
- The class duration: How long a class lasts. After the class duration, the class state changes to "Ended".
- The run-late time: How long a room can be open after the class ends. After the run-late time, the room is closed. Users are kicked out of the room immediately, and other users can no longer join the room.

Developers can set the above user properties when calling the `launch` method. The class properties are set by the first user joining the room.
