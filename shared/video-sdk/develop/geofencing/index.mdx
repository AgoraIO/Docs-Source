When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> media zone that is geographically closest to the user. However, to meet the laws and regulations of the user's country, you may need to specify, or filter out connections to a specific geographical zone. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> media zone users connect to.

## Understand the tech

After you turn on the restricted media zones feature, the SDK only accesses the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server in the specified zone(s), irrespective of the geographical location of the user. As an example, the following table shows the outcome if you specify North America as the access zone, and users connect to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> from North America and China respectively:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Designated access zone</th>
      <th>User's location</th>
      <th>Zone actually accessed by the SDK</th>
      <th>User experience</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">North America</td>
      <td>North America</td>
      <td rowspan="2">North America</td>
      <td>Normal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>China</td>
      <td>Quality may be affected</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Admonition title="information" type="info"> 
* If a server in the specified zone is not available, the SDK reports an error.
* Due to cross-regional public internet between the designated zone and the geographical location where the app user is located, the audio and video experience may be affected.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

## Implement restricted media zones
This section shows you how to restrict access to media zones in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
