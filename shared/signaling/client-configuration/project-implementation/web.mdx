### Geographical area configuration

To specify a geographical area for Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ connections, refer to the following code:

```js
// Set whitelist and blacklist areas
AgoraRTM.setArea({ areaCodes: ["GLOBAL"], excludedArea: "CHINA" })
```

### Proxy configuration

In some environments with restricted network services, you may need to set up a proxy service to access external resources. <Vg k="SIG" /> supports configuring a proxy service. You enable this feature during the the <Vg k="SIG" /> instance initialization.

```javascript
const { RTM } = AgoraRTM;
const appId = "your_appId";
const userId = "your_userId";
const rtmConfig = { cloudProxy: true };
const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig);
```

<Admonition type="info">
This feature is only available for Message channels and User channels.

### Private deployment configuration

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> is committed to offering its customers flexible, secure, and customizable solutions. Since version `2.2.0`, <Vg k="SIG" /> supports private deployments. This feature enables you to deploy and manage the <Vg k="SIG" /> environment yourself, giving you more control over your data and systems. 

<Vg k="SIG" /> provides [message](../core-functionality/message-channel) and [stream channels](../core-functionality/stream-channel). Choose one or both services based on your needs and budget. The following code shows you how to configure a private environment that deploys both services simultaneously:

```js
const appId = "your_appId";
const userId = "your_userId";
const rtmConfig = {
    privateConfig: {
        serviceType: ["MESSAGE", "STREAM"], // Service type for private deployment
        accessPointHosts: ["private.mynet.com"], // Private deployment server list, only domain name is supported
    }
};
const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig);
```

<Admonition type="info">
To deploy a private environment, you need to set up the backend service. For assistance, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). 
</Admonition>

### Log configuration

In the development and testing phase of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you may need to output more detailed information to locate and fix problems. Enable log output of the SDK and set the log information level by configuring `logLevel` when initializing the <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance. You can view the log information in the browser console.


```javascript
const { RTM } = AgoraRTM;
const appId = "your_appId";
const userId = "your_userId";
const rtmConfig = { logLevel : "debug" };
const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig);
```

Choose the log level from the following: 

| Enumeration Value       | Description      |
|------------|-------|
| `debug`   | Output all logs.      |
| `info`    | Output logs of level `error`, `warn`, and `info`. |
| `warn`    | Output logs of level `error`, and `warn`.         |
| `error`   | Output logs of level `error`.      |
| `none`    | No log output.   |

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
When your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is released to production, set the log level to `info`.
