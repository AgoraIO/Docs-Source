PK battles are a popular add-on to a host's live stream. In a PK battle, one host competes with another for the support of viewers to test the strength of their communities.

A PK battle scenario consists of the following key elements:

- The hosts start their individual live streams.
- Two hosts engage in a PK battle. 
- A PK battle request is sent and accepted. This is a timed activity that may span multiple rounds.
- The chat is divided. One host can mute the other to focus on communicating with their own audience.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers multiple solutions for implementing a PK battle scenario. The following table describes and compares these solutions:

| Solution | Description | Pricing | Pros | Cons |
| :------- | :---------- | :------ | :-------- | :----------- |
| [Media Relay](#media-relay) | Media Relay functionality in the <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to relay the live stream from a channel to one or more other channels. | Use of Media Relay is charged separately. | <ul><li>Media Relay is a mature and reliable technology.

| [Multiple Channels](#multiple-channels) | Each host has their own RTC channel. By default, audience members watch the live stream of their channel host. When the host enables the PK battle scenario, the audience members join the other host's RTC channel as well and subscribe to their live stream. | May incur additional costs due to increased audio live streaming usage. | <ul><li>No need to enable the cross-channel media stream relay feature.</li><li>Simpler to understand and integrate.</li></ul> | <ul><li>May cause increased audio usage</li><li>Investigation and troubleshooting can be difficult.</li><li>Limited customer validation; not yet widely adopted.</li></ul> |
| [Cloud Transcoder](#cloud-transcoder) | The Cloud Transcoder subscribes to the hosts' live streams, and manages UI layout and video/audio transcoding. It can be configured to generate multiple video profiles so that the audience in the channel can subscribe to a suitable video profile and bitrate according to their network conditions. | The Cloud Transcoder usage fee is charged separately. | <ul><li>Reduces bandwidth consumption.</li><li>Generates multiple video resolutions to enable the audience to adapt to network conditions.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Adding the UI element to the Cloud Transcoder layout can be complex.</li><li>Beta stage technology, not yet widely adopted.</li></ul> |

## Media Relay 

Cross-Channel media stream relay is available in native, Linux, and web SDKs.  The following figure illustrates two typical Media Relay use scenarios.

- **Relay a live stream to one destination channel**

    The Media Relay server pulls the live stream of UID 01 from Channel A, and pushes it to Channel B (assume UID as 01 in Channel B). UID 02 in Channel B, subscribes to UID 01's live stream.

- **Relay a live stream to multiple destination Channels**

    The Media Relay server pulls the live stream of UID 01 from Channel A, and pushes it to Channels B, C, and D (assume UID as 01 in Channels B,C, and D). UID 02 in Channel B, UID 03 in Channel C, and UID 04 in Channel D subscribe to UID 01's live stream.

Refer to [Cross-channel media stream relay](/interactive-live-streaming/core-functionality/cross-channel-media-relay) for implementation details.

## Multiple channels 

In the multiple channels solution, each host has their own independent channel. Each Host, and the audience in their channel, join the other hosts' Channel according to actual business rules.

For implementation details, see [Join multiple channels](/interactive-live-streaming/core-functionality/join-multiple-channels).

## Cloud Transcoder 

[Cloud Transcoder](https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/live-streaming-premium-legacy/cloud_transcoder) is a cloud-based transcoding service for audio and video live streaming scenarios. It pulls one or more audio and video streams from the server side and processes them with audio mixing, video layout composition, codec transcoding, and other operations before publishing the transcoded streams to an RTC channel for subscription by the audience. It is generally used to solve the following problems:

- Device performance issues

    Some users have devices with performance issues that cannot handle encoding, decoding, or rendering of multiple high-definition audio and video streams simultaneously. The solution is to merge the streams in the cloud and then push the merged streams back to the channel to reduce the device performance requirements.

- Network issues

    Some users have poor downstream networks. When subscribing to video streams from multiple hosts or a single high-definition video stream, they may experience stuttering or other network issues. By merging the streams in the cloud or converting them to lower resolution before delivery, the bitrate requirement is reduced, thus improving the viewer experience.
