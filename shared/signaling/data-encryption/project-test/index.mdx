To test the data encryption functionality:

1. **Configure the project**

    1. <OpenConfig/>

    1. <SetAppId/>

    1. <SetAuthenticationMethod/>

    1. Create the encryption key and salt
    
        In a production environment, you retrieve the encryption key and salt from an authentication server. For this code example you generate these parameters locally.

        * Create the 32-byte encryption key with the following command:

            ```bash
            openssl rand -hex 32
            ```
      
        * Create the salt with the following command

            ```bash
            openssl rand -base64 32
            ```

            In `config.json`:
            1. Paste the key into the `cipherKey` variable.
            1. Paste the salt into the `salt` variable.
            1. Set `encryptionMode` to 1.

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test data encryption**

    Login to <Vg k="SIG"/>, then send and receive secure messages.

    Communication between your test devices is end-to-end encrypted. This prevents data from being read or secretly modified by anyone other than the true sender and recipient.
