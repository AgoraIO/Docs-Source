This section shows you how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project.

### Get a list of shareable screens and windows
Call the `getScreenCaptureSources` method to get the **Display ID** or **Window ID** of the source you want to share. 

``` typescript
const sources = engine.getScreenCaptureSources(
  { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
  { width: 64, height: 64 },
  true
);
```

### Share a specific screen or window

- Share a specific screen using **Display ID** on macOS or Windows:

    ``` typescript
    engine.startScreenCaptureByDisplayId(
      targetSource.sourceId,
      {},
      {
        dimensions: { width, height },
        frameRate,
        bitrate,
        captureMouseCursor,
        excludeWindowList,
        excludeWindowCount: excludeWindowList.length,
        highLightWidth,
        highLightColor,
        enableHighLight,
      }
    );
    ```

- Share a specific window using **Window ID** on macOS or Windows:

    ``` typescript
    engine.startScreenCaptureByWindowId(
      targetSource.sourceId,
      {},
      {
        dimensions: { width, height },
        frameRate,
        bitrate,
        windowFocus,
        highLightWidth,
        highLightColor,
        enableHighLight,
      }
    );
    ```

### Capture system audio (Optional)

To capture and publish the audio played in the shared screen or window simultaneously, call `enableLoopbackRecording` to start sound card capture.

After you call this method, the audio played by other processes in the system is published to the remote end. To turn off sound card acquisition, call the method again.

### Join a channel and publish screen share streams

- To publish only a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream, add the following code to your project:

    ``` typescript
    agoraRtcEngine.joinChannel(token, channelId, uid, {
      autoSubscribeAudio: true,
      autoSubscribeVideo: true,
      publishMicrophoneTrack: false,
      publishCameraTrack: false,
      clientRoleType: ClientRoleType.ClientRoleBroadcaster,
      publishScreenTrack: true,
    });
    ```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
 To share captured audio during screen sharing, call `enableLoopbackRecording` to enable the sound card capture function and merge the sound played by the sound card with the local audio stream.
</Admonition>

- To publish both a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream and the video stream captured by the local camera simultaneously, add the following code to your project:

    ``` typescript
    // Call joinChannel to publish a stream of video captured by the local camera
    agoraRtcEngine.joinChannel(token, channelId, uid, {
      autoSubscribeAudio: true,
      autoSubscribeVideo: true,
      publishMicrophoneTrack: true,
      publishCameraTrack: true,
      clientRoleType: ClientRoleType.ClientRoleBroadcaster,
      publishScreenTrack: false,
    });

    // Call joinChannelEx to publish a screen-sharing stream
    agoraRtcEngine.joinChannelEx(
      token2,
      { channelId, localUid: uid2 },
      {
        autoSubscribeAudio: false,
        autoSubscribeVideo: false,
        publishMicrophoneTrack: false,
        publishCameraTrack: false,
        clientRoleType: ClientRoleType.ClientRoleBroadcaster,
        publishScreenTrack: true,
      }
    );
    ```

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- The video unit price for a screen-shared stream is based on the **video resolution** you set in `ScreenCaptureParameters`. If you do not pass dimensions in `ScreenCaptureParameters`, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> bills you for the default resolution of 1920 x 1080 (2,073,600). See [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details.
