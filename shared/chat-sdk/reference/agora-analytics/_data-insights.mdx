## Quality Insights

Follow these steps to view the Chat quality insights page:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>, and click **Agora Analytics** > **Chat Quality Insights** in the left menu bar.

2. In the upper left corner, select the project you want to view from the drop-down menu.

3. (Optional) In the upper right corner, select a unit and duration to view the end-user and server-side API data. The default is to view the last 30 minutes of data by minute.

 <div class="alert info">You can query any data within the last 7 days. If you view the data by hour, the time range of a single query cannot exceed 24 hours; if you view the data by minute, the time range of a single query cannot exceed 30 minutes.</div>

4. Click the **End-user Data** or **Server API Data** tab at the top of the page.

### End-user Data

The End-user Data section shows the number of request attempts, request success rate, and average request delay of client-side APIs. For details on the metric types and definitions, see <ProductWrapper product="agora-chat"> [End-user API metrics](../agora-analytics/data-metrics). </ProductWrapper> <ProductWrapper product="agora-analytics"> [End-user API metrics](../chat-sdk/data-metrics).</ProductWrapper>

To present the data more intuitively, different metrics use different charts:

| Metric                        | Map (on the left)                                            | Chart (on the right)                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request attempts              | The higher the number of request attempts, the darker the color of the area. | Line chart.                                                  |
| 1s/3s/5s request success rate | The higher the number of request attempts, the darker the color of the area. The larger the bubble, the lower the request success rate in that area. | Line chart.                                                  |
| Request delay                 | The higher the number of request attempts, the darker the color of the area. The larger the bubble, the higher the average request delay in that region. | Heat map chart, where the horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is the predefined value buckets of average request delay. The darker the color of the cell, the higher the number of request attempts in the corresponding time range. |

<div class="alert info">When entering the page for the first time, the chart shows the aggregated metric value of all areas on the map. After clicking an area on the map, the chart is updated to show the metric value of that area alone.</div>

### Server API Data

The Server API Data section shows the number of request attempts, request success rate, and average request delay of server-side RESTful APIs. For details on the metric types and definitions, see <ProductWrapper product="agora-chat"> [Server API metrics](../agora-analytics/data-metrics). </ProductWrapper> <ProductWrapper product="agora-analytics"> [Server API metrics](../chat-sdk/data-metrics).</ProductWrapper>

<div class="alert note">Server API data includes the RESTful API calls made by client SDKs. For example, <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> operations on the client SDK is implemented by calling the RESTful API, so it is counted in the Server API data.</div>

To present the data more intuitively, different metrics use different charts:

| Metric | Chart |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request attempts | Line chart. |
| 1s/3s/5s request success rate | Line chart. |
| Average request delay | Heat map chart, where the horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is the predefined value buckets of average request delay. The darker the color of the cell, the higher the number of request attempts in the corresponding time range. |
