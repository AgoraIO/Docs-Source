When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.
