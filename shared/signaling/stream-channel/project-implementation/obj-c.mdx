### Create a stream channel

To use stream channel functionality, call `createStreamChannel` to create a `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` object instance. 

```objc
NSError* create_error = nil;
AgoraRtmStreamChannel* stream_channel = [rtm createStreamChannel:@"your_channel" error:&create_error];
```

This method creates only one `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance at a time. If you need to create multiple instances, call the method multiple times.

```objc
NSError* create_error = nil;
// Create the first instance
AgoraRtmStreamChannel* stream_channel1 = [rtm createStreamChannel:@"your_channel1" error:&create_error];
// Create the second instance
AgoraRtmStreamChannel* stream_channel2 = [rtm createStreamChannel:@"your_channel2" error:&create_error];
```

<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> enables you to create unlimited stream channel instances in a single <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. However, best practice is to create channels based on your actual requirements to maintain optimal client-side performance. For instance, if you hold multiple stream channel instances, destroy the ones that are no longer in use to prevent resource blocking, and recreate them when they are needed again.

### Join a stream channel

Call the `joinWithOption` method on the `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance with appropriate options as follows:

```objc
AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption* join_opt =  [[AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption alloc] init];
join_opt.token =  @"your_token";
[stream_channel joinWithOption:join_opt completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
        if (errorInfo == nil) {
            NSLog(@"join channel success!!");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"join channel failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
        }
    }];
```

When joining a channel, set the `token` parameter in `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption` with a temporary token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

To facilitate testing of the app during development, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the project, and use the app ID in the `token` parameter when joining a channel.

```objc
AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption* join_opt =  [[AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption alloc] init];
join_opt.token =  @"your_appId";
join_opt.features = join_opt.features | AgoraRtmJoinChannelFeatureLock;
[stream_channel joinWithOption:join_opt completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"join channel success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"join channel failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
```

In stream channels, message flow is managed using topics. Even if you configure a global message listener, you must still join a topic to send messages. Similarly, to receive messages you must subscribe to a topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics) for more information.

### Send a message 

To send a message to a stream channel, you first need to:

- Create an `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance.
- Use the `joinWithOption` method to join a channel.
- Call `joinTopic` to register as a message publisher for the specified topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics).

Call `publishTopicMessage` to publish a message to a topic. This method sends a message to a single topic at a time. To deliver messages to multiple topics, call the method separately for each topic.

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```objc
    // Send a string message
    NSString* message = @"Hello Agora!"; // Message content
    [stream_channel publishTopicMessage:@"your_topic" message:message option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"publish success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"publish failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
    ```

* Binary message

    ```objc
    // Send a binary message
    unsigned char bytes[32] = { /* your raw values */ }; // Binary message content
    NSData* raw_message = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:bytes length:32]; // Creating NSData object with binary message
    [stream_channel publishTopicMessage:@"your_topic" data:raw_message option:nil completion:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
            if (errorInfo == nil) {
                NSLog(@"publish success!!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"publish failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
            }
        }];
    ```

In <Vg k="SIG" />, a user may register as a message publisher for up to 8 topics concurrently. However, there are no limitations on the number of users a single topic can accommodate. You can achieve a message transmission frequency to a topic of up to 120 QPS. This capability is useful in scenarios that demand high-frequency and high-concurrency data processing, such as Metaverse location status synchronization, collaborative office sketchpad applications, and parallel control operation-instructions transmission.


### Leave a stream channel

To leave a channel, call the `leave` method on the `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance:

```objc
[stream_channel leave:^(AgoraRtmCommonResponse * _Nullable response, AgoraRtmErrorInfo * _Nullable errorInfo) {
        if (errorInfo == nil) {
            NSLog(@"leave channel success!!");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"leave channel failed, errorCode %d, reason %@", errorInfo.errorCode, errorInfo.reason);
        }
    }];
```

To rejoin a stream channel, call the `joinWithOption` method again. You can join and leave as long as the corresponding `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance remains active and has not been destroyed.

### Destroy the stream channel instance

To destroy the stream channel instance, call `destroy`:

```objc
[stream_channel destroy];
stream_channel = nil;
```

<Admonition>
Destroying a stream channel removes the `AgoraRtmStreamChannel` instance from your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. This action is local to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> and does not affect other users or the <Vg k="SIG" /> channel.
