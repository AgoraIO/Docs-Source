Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Update the `APPID`, `token`, and `channel` parameter values in your code. 

1. To run the app, execute the following command in the project root directory:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    You see a window pop up showing the local video.

1. Invite a friend to run the demo app on a second device. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel.

    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video window; the audience can see the host in the remote video window and hear the host.
