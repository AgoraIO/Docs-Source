### Get the login ID list of other login devices of the current user

Call `getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform` to get the login ID list of other logged-in devices, and then select the target login ID as the message recipient to send messages to the specified device.

```javascript
chatClient.getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform().then((res) => {
  console.log(
    res,
    "Successfully obtained the login ID list of other login devices of the current user"
  );
  // Select a login ID as the message recipient.
  const toUserId = res.data[0];
  // toUserId as the message recipient.
  const options = {
    type: "txt",
    msg: "message content",
    to: toUserId,
    chatType: "singleChat",
  };
  // Create a message.
  const msg = AgoraChat.message.create(options);
  // Send a message.
  chatClient.send(msg);
});
```

### Get operations on other devices

Call `addEventHandler` to register listener events and listen to operations on other devices. After the server synchronizes information, the SDK will call back these events, and both the web end and other ends will receive notifications of friend and group-related operations.

For these operations, multi-device events have the same name as the single-device events. The only difference is the `from` field in the event: It is the current user ID in multi-end multi-device events, and the operator ID in single-device events. See [Listen for chat group eventsâ€‹](../client-api/chat-group/manage-chat-groups#listen-for-chat-group-events) and [Listen for contact events](../client-api/contacts?platform=web#listen-for-contact-events) for details.

In addition to friend and group events, the following events will trigger the `onMultiDeviceEvent` event:

```javascript
conn.addEventHandler("handlerId", {
  onContactAgreed: (event) => {},
  onGroupEvent: (event) => {},
  onMultiDeviceEvent: (event) => {
    switch (event.operation) {
      case "chatThreadCreate":
        //The current user creates a message thread on other devices.
        break;
      case "chatThreadDestroy":
        //The current user destroys the message thread on other devices.
        break;
      case "chatThreadJoin":
        //The current user joins the message thread on other devices.
        break;
      case "chatThreadLeave":
        //The current user leaves the message thread on other devices.
        break;
      case "chatThreadNameUpdate":
        //The current user updates the message thread on other devices.
        break;
      case "deleteRoaming":
        //The current user deletes the server conversation on other devices.
        break;
      case "memberAttributesUpdate":
        //The current user has updated the group member attributes on other devices.
        break;
      case "deleteRoaming":
        //The current user unidirectionally deletes message history of a conversation on other devices from the server.
        break;
      case "deleteConversation":
        //The current user has deleted a conversation on other devices.
        break;
      case "pinnedConversation":
        //The current user has pinned a conversation on other devices.
        break;
      case "unpinnedConversation":
        //The current user has unpinned a conversation on other devices.
        break;
      case "markConversation":
        //The current user has marked a conversation on other devices.
        break;
      case "unMarkConversation":
        //The current user has unmarked a conversation on other devices.
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  },
});
```
