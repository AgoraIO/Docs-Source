To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, call `setArea` and pass in the region you want to exclude or include.

    ```ts
        const useGeofencing = () => {
          useEffect(() => {
            AgoraRTC.setArea({
              areaCode: [AREAS.NORTH_AMERICA, AREAS.ASIA]
            })
          }, []);
        };
    ```

If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

* Whitelist certain domains
* Allow all IP addresses
* Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to="../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>.
