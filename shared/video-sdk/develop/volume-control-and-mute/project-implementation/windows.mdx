### Adjust playback Volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```cpp
int volume = 50;
int uid = 123456;
// Set the volume for all remote users played locally
mRtcEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
// Set the volume for a specific remote user played locally, for example, user 123456
mRtcEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid, volume)
```

### Getting User Volume (Callback)
During the entire process of audio collection, mixing, and playback, you can obtain the user IDs and their volumes of the three users (i.e. speakers) with the highest instantaneous volume in the channel through the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback. A returned `uid` of 0 indicates the local user.

<Admonition type="Note" title="Note" style="background-color:yellow">You need to enable `enableAudioVolumeIndication` to use the volume indication function.</Admonition>


```cpp
// Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
// their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
void CAudioVolumeEventHandler::onAudioVolumeIndication(const AudioVolumeInfo* speakers, unsigned int speakerNumber, int totalVolume){
}
```
### Adust the collection voulume
Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio collection signal.

```cpp
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
int vol = 50;
m_rtcEngine->adjustRecordingSignalVolume(vol);
```
**Precautions**:

When using the collection device to capture audio signals, the SDK defaults to a device volume of 85. A volume of 0 means mute, and a volume of 255 represents the maximum volume of the device. If the SDK detects that the volume of the collection device is too low in the current environment, it will automatically increase the volume of the collection device. The volume of the collection device affects the global volume of the device. If the volume of the collection device does not meet your needs, you can adjust the collection volume by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.
