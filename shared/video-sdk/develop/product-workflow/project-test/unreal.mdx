        ```cpp
        agoraEngine->adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine->adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUId,volume);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine->setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `OnMuteCheckboxChanged` replace the `muteRemoteAudioStream` call with one of the following:

        ```cpp
        agoraEngine->muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isMute);
        agoraEngine->muteLocalAudioStream(isMute);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.
