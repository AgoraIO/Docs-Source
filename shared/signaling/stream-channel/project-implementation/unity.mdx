### Create a stream channel

To use stream channel functionality, call `CreateStreamChannel` to create a `IStreamChannel` object instance. 

```csharp
IStreamChannel streamChannel = rtmClient.CreateStreamChannel("chat_room");
```
This method creates only one `IStreamChannel` instance at a time. If you need to create multiple instances, call the method multiple times.

```csharp
// Create the first instance
IStreamChannel streamChannel1 = rtmClient.CreateStreamChannel("chat_room1");
// Create the second instance
IStreamChannel streamChannel2 = rtmClient.CreateStreamChannel("chat_room2");
```

<Admonition type="info">
<Vg k="SIG" /> enables you to create unlimited stream channel instances in a single <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. However, best practice is to create channels based on your actual requirements to maintain optimal client-side performance. For instance, if you hold multiple stream channel instances, destroy the ones that are no longer in use to prevent resource blocking, and recreate them when they are needed again.

### Join a stream channel

Call the `JoinAsync` method on the `IStreamChannel` instance with appropriate options as follows:

```csharp
var options = new JoinChannelOptions();
options.token = "your_token";
var (status,response) = await streamChannel.JoinAsync(options);
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}       
else
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("User:{0} Join stream channel success! at Channel:{1}", response.UserId, response.ChannelName));
}
```

When joining a channel, set the `token` parameter in `JoinChannelOptions` with a temporary token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

To facilitate testing of the app during development, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the project, and use the app ID in the `token` parameter when joining a channel.
</Admonition>

```csharp
var options = new JoinChannelOptions();
options.token = "your_appId";
options.withLock = true;

var (status,response) = await streamChannel.JoinAsync(options);
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed,The error code is {1},because of: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}
else
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("User:{0} Join stream channel success! at Channel:{1}", response.UserId, response.ChannelName));
}
```

In stream channels, message flow is managed using topics. Even if you configure a global message listener, you must still join a topic to send messages. Similarly, to receive messages you must subscribe to a topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics) for more information.

### Send a message 

To send a message to a stream channel, you first need to:

- Create an `IStreamChannel` instance.
- Use the `JoinAsync` method to join a channel.
- Call `JoinTopicAsync` to register as a message publisher for the specified topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics).

Call `PublishTopicMessageAsync` to publish a message to a topic. This method sends a message to a single topic at a time. To deliver messages to multiple topics, call the method separately for each topic.

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```csharp
    // Send a string message
    string message = "left"; // Message content
    string topic = "Motion"; // Topic to which the message is sent
    var options = new TopicMessageOptions(); // Options for sending the message
    options.customType = "PlainTxt"; // Set the custom message type to "PlainTxt"
    var (status, response) = await streamChannel.PublishTopicMessageAsync(topic, message, options); // Send the message asynchronously
    if (status.Error)
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason)); // Log error information if message send fails
    }
    ```

* Binary message

    ```csharp
    // Send a binary message
    byte[] message = new byte[] { 00, 01, 35, 196 }; // Binary message content
    string topic = "Motion"; // Topic to which the message is sent
    var options = new TopicMessageOptions(); // Options for sending the message
    options.customType = "ByteArray"; // Set the custom message type to "ByteArray"
    var (status, response) = await streamChannel.PublishTopicMessageAsync(topic, message, options); // Send the message asynchronously
    if (status.Error)
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason)); // Log error information if message send fails
    }
    ```

In <Vg k="SIG" />, a user may register as a message publisher for up to 8 topics concurrently. However, there are no limitations on the number of users a single topic can accommodate. You can achieve a message transmission frequency to a topic of up to 120 QPS. This capability is useful in scenarios that demand high-frequency and high-concurrency data processing, such as Metaverse location status synchronization, collaborative office sketchpad applications, and parallel control operation-instructions transmission.

### Leave a stream channel

To leave a channel, call the `LeaveAsync` method on the `IStreamChannel` instance:

```csharp
var (status,response) = await streamChannel.LeaveAsync();
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}
else
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("User:{0} Join stream channel success! at Channel:{1}", response.UserId, response.ChannelName));
}
```

To rejoin a stream channel, call the `JoinAsync` method again. You can join and leave as long as the corresponding `IStreamChannel` instance remains active and has not been destroyed.

### Destroy the stream channel instance

To destroy a stream channel instance, call `Dispose`:

```csharp
var status = streamChannel.Dispose();
if (status.Error)
{
    Debug.Log(string.Format("{0} is failed, ErrorCode: {1}, due to: {2}", status.Operation, status.ErrorCode, status.Reason));
}
else
{
    Debug.Log("Dispose Channel Success!");
}
```

<Admonition type="info">
Destroying a stream channel removes the `IStreamChannel` instance from your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. This action is local to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> and does not affect other users or the <Vg k="SIG" /> channel.
