3. Compile the sample project

    To compile the sample project, execute the following commands in a terminal window:
    
    ```bash
    cd <extracted-folder>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example
    
    ./build-x86_64.sh
    ```

1. Run the sample project

    To launch the sample <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

    1. In the terminal, navigate to the output folder using the following command:

        ```bash
        cd out/x86_64
        ```
    
    1. Launch the compiled <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

        Execute the following command to launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Remember to replace the app ID, channel ID, and token with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

        ```bash
        ./hello_rtsa --app-id <your-app-id> --channel-id <your-channel-name> --token <authentication-token>
        ```

    1. On launching the complied <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, it joins the channel successfully.

        ```bash
        [INF] Welcome to RTSA SDK v1.9.0
        [INF] File parser found: h264
        [INF] File parser found: pcm
        [INF] [conn-1] Join the channel pankaj_encryption2 successfully, uid 2645490531 elapsed 602 ms
        [INF] [conn-1] Bandwidth change detected. Please adjust encoder bitrate to 499 kbps
        [INF] [conn-1] Bandwidth change detected. Please adjust encoder bitrate to 425 kbps
        ```
    1. **Test with Unauthorised user** : The user, who doesn't have `SSL key` and `salt` to communicate.  
        
       In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**. You see local user video screen for <Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo.
       
       But you can observe the compiled <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is started to show decrypt error:

       ```bash
        [INF] Welcome to RTSA SDK v1.9.0
        [INF] File parser found: h264
        [INF] File parser found: pcm
        [INF] [conn-1] Join the channel pankaj_encryption2 successfully, uid 2645490531 elapsed 602 ms
        [INF] [conn-1] Bandwidth change detected. Please adjust encoder bitrate to 499 kbps
        [INF] [conn-1] Bandwidth change detected. Please adjust encoder bitrate to 425 kbps
        [INF] [conn-1] Remote user "3674330576" has joined the channel, elapsed 6784 ms
        [WRN] Error 120 is captured. Error msg "audio:decrypt error"
        [WRN] Error 120 is captured. Error msg "video:not set"
        ```
        Which is perfectly fine and as per expectation as <Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo user doesn't have `SSL key` and `salt` to encrypt and decrypt data in the channel. So it is not authorised for communication with secured encrypted user.


    1. **Test with Authorised user** : The user, who have same `SSL key` and `salt` to communicate.

        Open two linux consoles (terminals). Go to the location `<extracted-folder>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example/out/x86_64` and execute the following command to launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> from both terminals. Remember to replace the app ID, channel ID, and token with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

        ```bash
        ./hello_rtsa --app-id <your-app-id> --channel-id <your-channel-name> --token <authentication-token>
        ```
        You can observe that these two users from these two terminals join channel and because of possesing same `SSL key` and `salt`, start tranferring data immediately.

        ```bash
        //User from console 1
