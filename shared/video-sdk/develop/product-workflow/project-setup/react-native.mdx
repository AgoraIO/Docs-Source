If your target platform is iOS:

1. Open the `.xcworkspace` file under the ios folder with Xcode.
1. Create a Broadcast Upload extension. Select **File** > **New** > **Target** > **Broadcast upload extension**.

    Ensure that **Include UI Extension** is disabled.
1. Set the `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` property of the `Info.plist` file inside the target to `AgoraReplayKitHandler`.
1. Include `Agora RTC` dependency to the newly created Broadcast Upload extension target. To do this, add the following lines at the end of the iOS Podfile:

    ```swift
    target 'ScreenShareExtension' do
    pod 'AgoraIrisRTC_iOS', '<version number>'
    end
    ```

1. Replace `ScreenShareExtension` with the name of the extension you have created. Similarly, replace `<version number>` with the correct version number. For example: `~> 4.1`.
