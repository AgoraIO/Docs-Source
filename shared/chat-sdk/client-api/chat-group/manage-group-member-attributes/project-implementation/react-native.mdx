### Set custom attributes of a group member via key and value items

Each chat group member can set their own attributes. Chat group admins/owners can also modify all members' attributes. Each custom attribute should be in key-value format.

Refer to the following sample code to set a custom attribute of a group member:

```typescript
// groupId: The group ID.
// member: The user ID of the group member.
// attributes: The custom attributes to set.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.setMemberAttribute(groupId, member, attributes)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("set group members attributes success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("set group members attributes fail.", reason);
  });

```

### Fetch group member custom attributes

Chat group members and group admins/owners can retrieve custom attributes of multiple group members by attribute key.

Refer to the following sample code to use the attribute key to fetch custom attributes of multiple group members:

```typescript
// groupId: The group ID.
// members: The array of user IDs of group members.
// attributeKeys: The array of keys of custom attributes to otain. If the array is empty or no key is passed in, all custom attributes of these members are obtained.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .groupManager.fetchMembersAttributes(groupId, members, attributeKeys)
  .then((result: Map<string, Record<string, string>>) => { 
    console.log("get group members attributes success.", result); 
  })
  .catch((reason) => { 
    console.log("get group members attributes fail.", reason); 
  });
```


### Listen for attribute changes of a group member

`ChatGroupEventListener` class holds callbacks that can be used to monitor the change of any key-value items. When such a change occurs, an `onMemberAttributesChanged` callback will notify the Client SDK by returning chat group ID, UID, and key-value pairs of the changes.

```typescript
 onMemberAttributesChanged(params: {
    groupId: string;
    member: string;
    attributes: any;
    operator: string;
  }): void {
    console.log(`${QuickTestScreenBase.TAG}: onStateChanged:`, params);
    this.that.setState({
      recvResult: `onMemberAttributesChanged: ` + params,
    });
  }
```
