Individual recording mode records audio and video of each UID as separate files.

### Inject online media stream

"Inject online media stream" refers to injecting an online media stream in an interactive live streaming channel to share the stream with all users in the channel. The Agora Video SDK provides a method for developers to inject an online mixed audio and video stream or an audio only stream to a channel. For details, see [inject online media stream](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/inject_stream_android).

## J

### Jitter

In real-time audio and video communication, jitter is the variation in the delay of data packets transmitted continuously on the network.

## L

### Last mile

The last mile refers to the network between the Agora edge server and the end user's device.

### Loopback test

A loopback test sends a signal from a communication device and is then returned (looped back) to it. It is often used to determine whether a device is working properly. For more information, see [test a media device](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/test_switch_device_android).

### Low-quality video stream

In dual-stream mode, the SDK transmits two video streams of differing quality at the same time. The low-quality video stream has a lower resolution and bitrate than the high-quality video stream. See [dual stream mode](#dual-stream-mode) for details.

## M

### MediaPlayer kit

The mediaplayer kit is a plug-in of the Agora Video SDK to play local and online media resources and publish the media streams to other users in an interactive live streaming channel. 

### Media stream

A media stream is an object that contains media data.

### Media push

Media push means that the Agora server converts the stream in the channel from the Agora protocol to the standard protocol, and pushes the stream to a third-party CDN.
