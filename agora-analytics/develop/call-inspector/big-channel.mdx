## Key terms

This section describes the key terms used in Call Inspector. See [Agora Key Terms](../../reference/glossary) for more.

### Big Channel

Every call or interactive streaming must occur in a channel. If we imagine an app being a building, a channel is a room in the building. Agora calls a channel with many online users as a Big Channel, you need to define your own Big Channel in the **Big Channel Config** page. You can enable Big Channel for specified channels or projects, to better understand the behavior and to optimize users' experience.

### User

Each user in the call has a unique [user ID](../../reference/glossary#user-iduid).

Big Channel counts a unique username in a unique channel as one user. If a real-life user joins one channel with different usernames, Big Channel counts the user as multiple users.

### Host

All users who have sent streams to the channel. If a user has sent streams in the first minute of a call and does not send any further streams, then <Vpd k="NAME"/> also determines this user as a host.

### Audience

The users who only receive streams from a channel.

### Poor user experience

During a call, users may have quality issues, such as poor audio quality and frozen video, caused by various factors. Agora calls this as a poor user experience, and you can see detailed information about quality factors in [Metrics ID](../../reference/api#_metrics_id).

### Call

Many calls can occur in a channel. When a user joins an empty channel, a call starts. When all users leave the channel, this call ends. If a user joins the channel after the call ends, then a new call starts. The period between the first user joining a channel and the last user leaving the channel is considered one call.

### Call duration

* A call's duration is the time from the first user joining the channel to the last user leaving the channel.
* A user's duration is the time from the user joining to leaving the channel. A user may join and leave a channel repeatedly during a call.

### Current/Total

* In a Big Channel with ongoing calls, **Details** shows the current data, such as the current number of users, hosts, and audience members.
* In a Big Channel with concluded calls, **Details** shows the total data, such as the total number of users, hosts, and audience members during the call.
