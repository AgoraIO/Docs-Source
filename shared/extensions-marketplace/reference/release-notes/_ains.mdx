### v2.0.1

#### Compatibility changes

This version no longer supports calling the `disable` method before `pipe` to disable the processor. Ensure that you call `pipe` before invoking `disable`.
 
#### New features
- Added the `setLogLevel` method to the `IAIDenoiserExtension` interface class to set the log level for the plugin and WASM module.
- Added the `setLatency` method to the `IAIDenoiserProcessor` interface class to configure latency for noise reduction processing.

#### Improvements
- Updated the noise reduction algorithm for improved noise suppression, voice fidelity, and overall robustness.
- Added support for 48 KHz audio sample rate.
- Optimized CPU resource allocation strategy to enhance runtime efficiency.

#### API changes
The implementation of callbacks has been revised in this version. The original callbacks `onloaderror`, `onoverload`, `ondump`, and `ondumpend` are deprecated. Use the `on` method with event names `"pipeerror"`, `"overload"`, `"dump"`, or `"dumpend"` to listen for the corresponding events instead.

### v1.1.0

#### Improvement

This release improves the calculation performance of the AI-powered noise suppression algorithm.

#### New features

This release adds the following APIs and parameters:

- **APIs**:
    - `checkCompatibility`: Checks whether the AI Noise Suppression extension is supported on the current browser.
    - `setMode`: Sets the noise suppression mode as AI noise suppression or stationary noise suppression.
    - `setLevel`: Sets the AI noise suppression level.
- **Parameters**:
    - `elapsedTime` in `onoverload`: Reports the time in ms that the extension needs to process one audio frame.

For API details, see [AI Noise Suppression](/interactive-live-streaming/advanced/ai-noise-suppression).

#### Compatibility changes

This release brings the following changes:

- AI Noise Suppression supports Agora Video SDK for Web v4.15.0 or later.
- The extension has Wasm dependencies only. Because JS dependencies are removed, you need to publish the Wasm files located in the `node_modules/agora-extension-ai-denoiser/external` directory again. If you have enabled the Content Security Policy (CSP), you need to modify the CSP configuration. See [AI Noise Suppression](/interactive-live-streaming/advanced/ai-noise-suppression) for details.
- The audio data is dumped in PCM format instead of WAV format.
- To adjust the intensity of noise suppression, best practice is to call `setLevel`.

### v1.0.0

First release.

## Noise suppression for use cases involving AI

### v1.0.0-beta2

[`agora-conversational-ai-denoiser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-conversational-ai-denoiser) v1.0.0-beta2 was released on March 5, 2025, to enhance the user experience in applications powered by [Agora Conversational AI Engine](/conversational-ai/overview/product-overview).

<Admonition type="caution">
The `agora-conversational-ai-denoiser` plugin has high CPU usage. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommend using it only for AI-related use cases.
</Admonition>
 
#### Key features:

- Significantly improved voice protection, especially for singing.
- Reduced risk of audio capture and playback stuttering during operation.
- When AI noise suppression is enabled, the default maximum AGC gain is reduced from 24dB to 12dB.
