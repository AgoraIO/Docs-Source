Media stream encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel can see and hear each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires media stream encryption, <Vpd k="NAME"/> provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.

This page shows you how to integrate built-in media stream encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Understand the tech

To ensure secure communication, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses the same SSL [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to encrypt and decrypt data in the channel. You use the key and salt to create an encryption configuration. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses the encryption configuration to encrypt a stream and sends it to remote users. When the remote user receives the encrypted media stream, the remote <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> decrypts the media stream using the same salt and key.

The following figure shows the call flow for the media stream encryption:

All users in a channel must use the same encryption configuration to initiate `agoraEngine` and enable encryption before joining a channel. If you don’t have the correct configuration, you cannot decrypt channel content. Best practice is that your authentication system generates a new key and salt regularly.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequites />

- Set up [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) on your development device.


## Implement <Vg k="COMPANY" /> media stream encryption

To implement media stream encryption, do the following:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test secure channel encryption

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="COMPANY" /> media stream encryption in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProjectTest />

Communication between your test devices is end-to-end encrypted. This prevents data from being read or secretly modified by anyone other than the true sender and recipient.
