### Equipment quality test

The SDK provides the `startEchoTest` [3/3] method to test the network connection and whether the audio and video devices are working properly. Refer to the following steps to implement the device quality test:

1. Before joining a channel, call `startEchoTest` [3/3] with `EchoTestConfiguration`. Specify the channel name, whether to test audio or video, and the time interval for the echo.

1. After starting the test, face the camera and speak into the microphone. The user's audio or video is played back after a short delay. If the playback is normal, it means that the user's devices and upstream and downstream network are working normally. 

1. To stop the test, call `stopEchoTest`, and then call `joinChannel` to join a channel.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
Using `startEchoTest` [3/3] to test an audio device and a video device at the same time may result in a brief audio-video desynchronization of the test results.
</Admonition>

To implement running an echo test in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` java
// Test audio devices
if (v.getId() == R.id.btn_echo) {
    // Create an instance of EchoTestConfiguration.
    EchoTestConfiguration config = new EchoTestConfiguration();
    // Turn off the video device test
    config.enableVideo = false;
    // Turn on the audio device test
    config.enableAudio = true;
    // Set the interval for returning test results
    config.intervalInSeconds = MAX_COUNT_DOWN;
    // Identify the channel name for each test
    config.channelId = "AudioEchoTest" + (new Random().nextInt(1000) + 10000);
    // Start testing audio devices
    engine.startEchoTest(config);
} else if (v.getId() == R.id.btn_echo_video) {
    EchoTestConfiguration config = new EchoTestConfiguration();
    // Turn on video device testing
    config.enableVideo = true;
    // Specifies the view used to render the local user video
    config.view = requireView().findViewById(R.id.surfaceView);
    // Test with audio device turned off
    config.enableAudio = false;
    // Set the desired delay of the video screen
    config.intervalInSeconds = MAX_COUNT_DOWN;
    // Identify the channel name for each test
    config.channelId = "VideoEchoTest" + (new Random().nextInt(1000) + 10000);
    // Start testing video equipment
    engine.startEchoTest(config);
}
```

### Network quality analysis

The SDK provides the `startLastmileProbeTest` method to probe the last-mile network quality before joining a channel. The method returns information about the network quality score and network statistics. Take the following steps to run a last-mile network quality probe test:

1. Before joining a channel or switching user roles, call `startLastmileProbeTest` to start the network test. Set the probe configuration and the expected maximum bitrate in `LastmileProbeConfig`.

1. After you start the test, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
    
    - `onLastmileQuality`: This callback is triggered two seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It provides feedback on the upstream and downstream network quality through a subjective `quality` score.

    - `onLastmileProbeResult`: This callback is triggered 30 seconds after `startLastmileProbeTest` is called. It returns objective real-time network statistics, including `packetLossRate`, network `jitter`, and `availableBandwidth`.

1. Call `stopLastmileProbeTest` to stop last-mile network testing.

To implement network quality testing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` java
// Configure a LastmileProbeConfig instance
LastmileProbeConfig config = new LastmileProbeConfig(){};
// Detect uplink network quality
config.probeUplink = true;
// Detect downlink network quality
config.probeDownlink = true;
// The maximum transmission bitrate (bps) expected by the user. The range is [100000,5000000].
config.expectedUplinkBitrate = 100000;
// The maximum bitrate (bps) that the user expects to receive. The range is [100000,5000000].
config.expectedDownlinkBitrate = 100000;
// Start last mile network test before joining the channel.
// Calling startLastmileProbeTest for pre-call network quality checking consumes network traffic. Therefore, after calling this method, Agora recommends that you do not call any other method until you receive the onLastmileProbeResult callback
rtcEngine.startLastmileProbeTest(config);

// Implemented in the IRtcEngineEventHandler class
// Triggered 2 seconds after the start of the last mile test
// The onLastmileQuality callback may return UNKNOWN the first time it is triggered. Subsequent callbacks will return the results of the test
public void onLastmileQuality(int quality){
    statisticsInfo.setLastMileQuality(quality);
    updateLastMileResult();
}


// Implemented in the IRtcEngineEventHandler class
// Triggered 30 seconds after starting the last mile test
public void onLastmileProbeResult(LastmileProbeResult) {
    // (1) Stop the test inside the callback. Agora recommends not calling any other APIs until the test is finished
    rtcEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
    statisticsInfo.setLastMileProbeResult(lastmileProbeResult);
    updateLastMileResult();
}

// (2) There is also the option to stop the test at another time. Agora does not recommend calling any other APIs until the test is finished
rtcEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
```
