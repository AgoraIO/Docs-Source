This section shows you how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project. The basic API call sequence is shown in the figure below:

<details>
<summary>Screen share process</summary>

![Screen Share Process](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-macos-unreal-windows.svg)
</details>

To enable <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, choose one of the following methods according to your use-case:

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` before joining the channel, then call `joinChannel [2/2]` to join the channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to `true` to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` after joining the channel, then call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to `true` to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

The flow diagram and implementation steps in this article are based on the first use-case.

### Get resource list

Call `getScreenCaptureSources` to get an object list of screens and windows available for sharing. The list contains important information such as the **window ID** and **screen ID**. This enables users to choose a certain screen or window, through the thumbnails in the list, for sharing. 

``` cpp
{
    // Get information about a specified shareable window or screen
    agora::rtc::IScreenCaptureSourceList* listCapture = m_rtcEngine->getScreenCaptureSources(sz, sz, true);
    for (int i = 0; i < listCapture->getCount(); i++)
    {
        // Returns information about a shareable window or screen
        agora::rtc::ScreenCaptureSourceInfo info = listCapture->getSourceInfo(i);
    }

    // Get the number of windows and screens that can be shared
    return static_cast<int>(m_listWnd.GetCount());
}
```

### Enable <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Depending on your application use-case, choose one of the following <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> methods.

#### Share the entire screen

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` with the following parameters to start sharing the whole screen:

- Set `sourceId` to the `displayId` (screen ID) obtained in the resource list.
- Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
    - In document scenes or remote control scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 FPS**.
    - In game scenes or video scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 FPS**.

``` cpp
// Start sharing the specified screen
m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByDisplayId(id, regionRect, capParam);
```

#### Share app window

Call `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` with the following parameters to start sharing an app window:

- Set `sourceId` to the `windowId` obtained in the resource list.
- Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
    - In document scenes or remote control scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 FPS**.
    - In game scenes or video scenes, it is recommended to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 FPS**.

``` cpp
// Start sharing a specified app window
ret = m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByWindowId(hWnd, rcCapWnd, capParam);
```

#### Share a designated area

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` method to start sharing, and set `regionRect` to the area you want to share relative to the whole screen or window. The sample code is as follows:

``` cpp
// Set the parameters of the area you want to share
m_screenRegion = { 0,0,heightX,heightY };
agora::rtc::Rectangle rcCapWnd = { m_screenRegion.x, m_screenRegion.y, (int)(m_screenRegion.width * scale), (int)(m_screenRegion.height * scale) };
...
m_rtcEngine->startScreenCaptureByDisplayId(id, rcCapWnd, m_screenParam);
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">If the sharing area is set to extend beyond the boundaries of the screen, only the content within the screen is shared. If the width or height is set to 0, the entire screen is shared.</Admonition>

### Set up a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario (Optional)

Call the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method to set the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario. Set the `screenScenario` to any one of the following according to the actual usage scenario:

- `SCREEN_SCENARIO_DOCUMENT`: Document scenario
- `SCREEN_SCENARIO_GAMING`: Game scenario
- `SCREEN_SCENARIO_VIDEO`: Video scenario
- `SCREEN_SCENARIO_RDC`: Remote control scenario

``` cpp
m_rtcEngine->setScreenCaptureScenario(type);
```

### Capture system audio (Optional)

To capture and publish the audio played in the shared screen or window simultaneously, call `enableLoopbackRecording` to start sound card capture.

After you call this method, the audio played by other processes in the system is published to the remote end. To turn off sound card acquisition, call the method again.

### Join a channel and publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream

Call `joinChannel`[2/2] to join the channel and set the channel media options. 

``` cpp
// Set Channel Media Options
ChannelMediaOptions option;
option.channelProfile = CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING;
option.clientRoleType = CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER;
option.publishMicrophoneTrack  = true;
// Publish the screen captured video to the channel
// To publish a second screen captured video in the channel, replace the next line of code with option.publishSecondaryScreenTrack = true；
option.publishScreenTrack = true;
// Join the channel
m_rtcEngine->joinChannel("Your Token", "Your ChannelId", 0, option)
```

#### Additional notes

This article demonstrates publishing the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream directly in the channel without publishing the stream captured by the camera. In a real-world scenario, the requirements may be different from the description in this document. Adjust the code logic based on your scenario. 

To publish the stream captured by the camera and the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream at the same time, refer to the following steps:

- Call `joinChannel`[2/2] to join the first channel and publish the video stream captured by the camera in this channel.
- Call `joinChannelEx` to join a second channel and publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream.

### Update <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters

To dynamically update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters in the channel, call the following methods:

- To update the shared region of the screen, call the `updateScreenCaptureRegion` method to reset the `regionRect` parameter and define a new sharing area.
- - To update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters, such as video encoding resolution, frame rate, bitrate, or to stroke the screen or app window, or block a specified
window, call the `updateScreenCaptureParameters` method and update the `captureParams` parameter configuration.

``` cpp
// Update the screen share area
int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureRegion(rect);

// Update screen sharing parameters
int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
```

### Stroke the screen 

Depending on your scenario, you may stroke the shared screen or window in one of the following ways:

- Stroke when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`, set `enableHighLight` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both `highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.

- Stroke after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `enableHighLight` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both `highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.

``` cpp
bool highLigne = m_chkHighLight.GetCheck();
m_screenParam.enableHighLight = highLigne;
// Setting the stroke color of the screen
m_screenParam.highLightColor = 0xFFFF0000;
// Setting the stroke width of the screen
m_screenParam.highLightWidth = 5;
// Enable Screen Stroke
int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
```

### Block window

Depending on your usage scenario, you may block a specified window in one of the following ways:

- Block windows when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.

- Block windows after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.

``` cpp
m_screenParam.excludeWindowList = excludeViews;
m_screenParam.excludeWindowCount = count;

int ret = m_rtcEngine->updateScreenCaptureParameters(m_screenParam);
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">On the Windows platform, you can block up to 24 windows.</Admonition>

### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Call `stopScreenCapture` to stop sharing the screen within a channel. 

``` cpp
// Stop screen sharing
ret = m_rtcEngine->stopScreenCapture();
```

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- After turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the resolution of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as the billing standard. Please see [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details. The default resolution is 1280 × 720, but you can adjust it according to your business needs.
- To share 4K Ultra-HD resolution video during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, your device needs to meet certain requirements. The minimum device specifications recommended by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> are: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHZ.
