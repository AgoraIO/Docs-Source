import ProjectImplement from '@docs/shared/signaling/add-event-listener/project-implementation/index.mdx';

To receive message and event notifications when you subscribe to or join channels, you add an event listener. An event listener is triggered by the SDK to inform the client about <Vg k="SIG" /> events and state changes. The listener enables you to respond to events like successful connection to <Vg k="SIG" />, token expiration, received messages, and other presence, storage, and lock events.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.
    
## Implement event listeners

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="MESS_SDK"/> to implement event listeners.
