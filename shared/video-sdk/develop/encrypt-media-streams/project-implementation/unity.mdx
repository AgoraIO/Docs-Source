To add built-in media stream encryption to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following steps:

<KeyAndSalt />

2. Implement client-side logic

    1. Obtain a String key and Base64-encoded salt from the server.

    1. Convert the salt from Base64 to `uint8_t`.

    1. Before joining the channel, call `EnableEncryption` to set the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode, and pass the key and salt to the SDK.

<Admonition type="caution" title="note">
- All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt. Discrepancies may lead to unexpected behavior, such as black screens or audio loss.
- To ensure security, best practice is to use a new key and salt each time you enable media stream encryption.
</Admonition>

To implement this logic, refer to the following code:

```csharp
// Secret key from server transmission
string secret;
// 32-bit salt from service transfer
byte[] kdfSal;
// Setting the encryption mode
ENCRYPTION_MODE EncrytionMode = ENCRYPTION_MODE.AES_128_GCM2;
var config = new EncryptionConfig
{
    encryptionMode = EncrytionMode,
    encryptionKey = secret,
    encryptionKdfSalt = kdfSal
};
// Enables encryption. Please call this method after initializing the engine
var nRet= RtcEngine.EnableEncryption(true, config);
Debug.Log("EnableEncryption: " + nRet);
```
