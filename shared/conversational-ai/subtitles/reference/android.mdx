#### `ConversationSubtitleController`

```kotlin
class ConversationSubtitleController (
    private val config: SubtitleRenderConfig
)
``` 

- `config`: Subtitle rendering configuration. See [`SubtitleRenderConfig`](#subtitlerenderconfig) for details.


#### `SubtitleRenderConfig`

```kotlin
data class SubtitleRenderConfig (
    val rtcEngine: RtcEngine,
    val renderMode: SubtitleRenderMode?,
    val callback: IConversationSubtitleCallback?
)
```

- `rtcEngine`：Agora `RtcEngine` instance.
- `renderMode`: Subtitle rendering mode, see [`SubtitleRenderMode`](#subtitlerendermode) for details.
- `callback`: The callback interface for receiving subtitle content updates, see [`IConversationSubtitleCallback`](#iconversationsubtitlecallback) for details.

#### `SubtitleRenderMode` 

```kotlin
enum class SubtitleRenderMode {
    Text,
    Word
}
```

- `Text`: Sentence-by-sentence rendering mode. The subtitle content received by the callback is fully rendered on the UI.
- `Word`: Word-by-word rendering mode. The subtitle content received by the callback is rendered word by word on the UI.

<Admonition type="caution"> 
Using the word-by-word rendering mode (`Word`) requires that your chosen TTS vendor supports word-by-word output, otherwise, it will automatically fall back to sentence-by-sentence rendering mode (`Text`). 
</Admonition>

#### `IConversationSubtitleCallback`

The callback interface for subtitle content update events.

```kotlin
interface IConversationSubtitleCallback {
    fun onSubtitleUpdated(subtitle: SubtitleMessage)
}
```

- `onSubtitleUpdated`: Subtitle update callback.
    - `subtitle`: Updated subtitle message, see for details [`SubtitleMessage`](#subtitlemessage).

#### `SubtitleMessage`

```kotlin
data class SubtitleMessage(
    val turnId: Long,
    val userId: Int,
    val text: String,
    var status: SubtitleStatus
)
```

- `turnId`: The identifier of the conversation turn. One conversation turn between the user and the agent corresponds to one `turnId`, and follows the following rules:
    - `turnId = 0`, This is the welcome message of the agent, and there is no subtitle for the user.
    - `turnId ≥ 1`, The subtitles for the user or agent in that round. Use the `userId` to display the user's subtitles before the agent's subtitles, and then repeat the process for round +1.

    <Admonition type="caution">
    There is no guarantee that callbacks will be in strictly increasing `turnId` order. If you encounter out-of-order situations, implement the sorting logic yourself.
    </Admonition>

- `userId`: The user ID associated with this subtitle message. In the current version, `0` represents the user, non-zero represents the agent ID.
- `text`: Subtitle text content.
- `status`: The current status of the subtitles. See [`SubtitleStatus`](#subtitlestatus) for details.

#### SubtitleStatus

Use `SubtitleStatus` for special UI processing based on the status, such as displaying an interruption mark at the end of the subtitle.

```kotlin
enum class SubtitleStatus {
    Progress,
    End,
    Interrupted
}
```

- `Progress`: The subtitles are still being generated; the user or agent has not finished speaking.
- `End`: The subtitle generation is complete; the user or agent has finished speaking.
- `Interrupted`: The subtitles were interrupted before completion; the user actively stopped the agent’s response.
