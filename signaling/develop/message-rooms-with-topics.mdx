After your user joins the Stream Channel, you can listen to the event notifications in the channel, but if you
need to send
and receive messages, you also need to implement it through the Topic feature, see Topic for details . RTM allows thousands of Stream Channels to exist in your app at the same time, but due to end-side performance and bandwidth limitations, a single client can only join a limited number of channels at the same time
