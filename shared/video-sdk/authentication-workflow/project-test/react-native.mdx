3. **Configure your project**:

    In `src/agora-manager/config.ts`, update the following:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `token` - an empty string.
    * `serverUrl` - with the base URL for your token server.
        For example: `https://agora-token-service-production-yay.up.railway.app`.
    * `tokenExpiryTime` - with an integer denoting the number of seconds after which a token expires.


1.  **Start the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**

    - iOS
         ```bash
         yarn run ios
         ```
    - Android

         ```bash
         yarn run android
         ```
    A moment later you see the project installed on your device. If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
