A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You use webhooks to notify your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> or back-end system when certain <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> events occur. For example, when a channel is created, a user joins and leaves a channel, or changes role from host to audience. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> (<Vg k="NCS" />) enables you to subscribe to events and receive notifications about them across multiple product lines.

## Understand the tech

Using <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> you subscribe to specific events for your project and tell <Vg k="NCS" /> the URL of the webhooks you have configured to receive these events. <Vg k="NCS" /> sends notifications of your events to your webhooks every time they occur. Your server authenticates the notification and returns `200 Ok` to confirm reception. You use the information in the JSON payload of each notification to give the best user experience to your users.

The following figure illustrates the workflow when <Vg k="NCS" /> is enabled for the specific events you subscribe to:

![](/images/shared/ncs-worklow.png)

1. A user commits an action that creates an event. For example, creates a channel.
1. <Vg k="NCS" /> sends an HTTPS POST request to your webhook.
1. Your server validates the request signature, then sends a response to <Vg k="NCS" /> within 10 seconds. The response body must be in JSON.

If <Vg k="NCS" /> receives `200 OK` within 10 seconds of sending the initial notification, the callback is considered successful. If these conditions are not met, <Vg k="NCS" /> immediately resends the notification. The interval between notification attempts gradually increases. <Vg k="NCS" /> stops sending notifications after three retries.

## Prerequisites

To set up and use Agora NCS, you must have:

- A [valid Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account).
- An [active Agora project](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-project).
- A computer with Internet access.
    
    If your network access is restricted by a firewall, call the [IP address query API](#ip-address-query-api) to retrieve the <Vg k="NCS" /> IP addresses , then configure the firewall to allow these IP addresses.

## Handle notifications for specific events

In order to handle notifications for the events you subscribe to you need to:

- [Create your webhook](#create-your-webhook)
- [Enable <Vg k="NCS" />](#enable-ncs)
- [Verify NCS signatures](#add-signature-verification)
- [Implement online user status tracking](#implement-online-user-status-tracking)
- [Handle redundant notifications and abnormal user activity](#handle-redundand-notifications-and-abnormal-user-activity)

### Create your webhook

Once <Vg k="NCS" /> is enabled, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends notification callbacks as `HTTPS POST` requests to your webhook when events that you are subscribed to occur. The data format of the requests is JSON, the character encoding is `UTF-8`, and the signature algorithm is `HMAC/SHA1` or `HMAC/SHA256`.

For <Vg k="NCS" />, a webhook is an endpoint on an `HTTP` server that handles these requests. In a production environment you write this in your web infrastructure, for development purposes best practice is to create a simple local server and use a service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to supply a public URL that you register with  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> when you enable <Vg k="NCS" />.

To do this, take the following steps:

1. **Setup a Java project for your server**

    Your server receives and handles <Vg k="NCS" /> notifications. The `RootHandler` handles requests sent to the root address of your server and the `NcsHandler` handles the <Vg k="NCS" /> notifications sent to `<your server address>/ncsNotify`. To Set up your server, create a new Java project and add the following code to a file named `Main.java`:

    ```java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
    import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

    public class Main {
      public static int port = 80;

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start http server
        SimpleHttpServer httpServer = new SimpleHttpServer();
        httpServer.Start(port);
      }

      static class SimpleHttpServer {
        private HttpServer server;

        public void Start(int port) {
          try {
            server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(port), 0);
            System.out.println("NCS webhook server started at port " + port);
            server.createContext("/", new Handlers.RootHandler());
            server.createContext("/ncsNotify", new Handlers.NcsHandler());
            server.setExecutor(null);
            server.start();
          } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
          }
        }

        public void Stop() {
          server.stop(0);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1.  **Add a JSON library to your project**

    The body of an HTTP request that your server receives contains event parameters in JSON format. To read these parameters download the [`json-simple-1.1.1.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/json-simple/json-simple/1.1.1/) library and add it to your JAVA project. 

1. **Handle <Vg k="NCS" /> callbacks** 

    To define the `RootHandler` and the `NcsHandler`, create a new file named `Handlers.java` in your JAVA project folder. Add the following code to this file:

    ```java
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.io.InputStreamReader;
    import java.io.OutputStream;
    import java.util.stream.Collectors;

    import com.sun.net.httpserver.Headers;
    import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
    import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
    import org.json.simple.JSONObject;
    import org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser;

    public class Handlers {

        public static class RootHandler implements HttpHandler {
            @Override
            public void handle(HttpExchange he) throws IOException {
                String response = "<h1>Agora NCS Demo</h1>" + "<h2>Port: " + Main.port + "</h2>";
                he.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
                OutputStream os = he.getResponseBody();
                os.write(response.getBytes());
                os.close();
            }
        }

        public static class NcsHandler implements HttpHandler {

            @Override
            public void handle(HttpExchange he) throws IOException {
                Headers headers = he.getRequestHeaders();
                // Read signatures from the request header
                String agoraSignature = headers.getFirst("Agora-Signature");
                //String agoraSignatureV2 = headers.getFirst("Agora-Signature-V2");

                InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(he.getRequestBody(), "utf-8");
                BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
                
                // Read the request body
                String body = br.lines()
                    .collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));

                String noticeId, channelName = "";
                long productId, clientSeq = 0;
                int uid = 0, eventType;

                // Read event parameters from JSON in the request body
                try {
                    JSONObject jsonObj = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(body);

                    noticeId = (String) jsonObj.get("noticeId");
                    productId = (long) jsonObj.get("productId");
                    eventType = (int) (long) jsonObj.get("eventType");
                    JSONObject payload = (JSONObject) jsonObj.get("payload");

                    // Read payload
                    if (payload.containsKey("clientSeq"))
                        clientSeq = (long) payload.get("clientSeq");

                    if (payload.containsKey("uid"))
                        uid = (int) (long) payload.get("uid");

                    if (payload.containsKey("channelName"))
                        channelName = (String) payload.get("channelName");

                    System.out.println(
                        "Event code: " + eventType
                                    + " Uid: " + uid
                                    + " Channel: " + channelName
                                    + " ClientSeq: " + clientSeq);

                } catch (Exception e) {
                    System.out.println("Error parsing JSON: " + e.toString());
                    return;
                }

                // Send OK response code 200
                String response = "Ok";
                he.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
                OutputStream os = he.getResponseBody();
                os.write(response.toString().getBytes());
                os.close();

            }
        }

    }
    ```

1. **Create a public URL for your server**

    In this example you use ngrok to create a public URL for your server.

    1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). If you have `Chocolatey`, use the following command:

        ```bash
        choco install ngrok
        ```
    
    1. Add an `authtoken` to ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
        ```

        To obtain an `authtoken`, [sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) with ngrok.


    1. Start a tunnel to your local server using the following command:

        ```bash
        ngrok http <local server port>
        ```

        You see a **Forwarding** URL displayed such as `https:// 1111-123-456-789-99.ap.ngrok.io`. This is the public URL for your local server that you use to enable <Vg k="NCS" />.

### Implement online user status tracking

This section provides sample Java code to show how to use channel event callbacks to maintain online user status at your app server.

To maintain a user registry, take the following steps:

1. Create a new file in you JAVA project folder named `UserRegistry.java` containing the following code.

    ```java
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Timer;
    import java.util.TimerTask;

    public class UserRegistry {
        public static int EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN = 103;
        public static int EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT = 104;
        public static int EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN = 105;
        public static int EVENT_AUDIENCE_QUIT = 106;
        public static int EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER = 111;
        public static int EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE = 112;
        
        public static int ROLE_BROADCASTER = 1;
        public static int ROLE_AUDIENCE = 2;
        public static int WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS = 60 * 1000;
        private static Timer timer = new Timer();

        class User { // Holds user information
            int uid; // user ID
            int role; // user role
            boolean isOnline; // whether the user is in a channel
            long lastClientSeq; // clientSeq of the last event handled by your server

            public User(int uid, int role, boolean isOnline, long clientSeq) {
                this.uid = uid;
                this.role = role;
                this.isOnline = isOnline;
                this.lastClientSeq = clientSeq;
            }
        };

        // Channel list
        private static HashMap<String, Channel> channels = new HashMap<>();;

        class Channel { // Holds the list of users in each channel
            HashMap<Integer, User> users = new HashMap<>();
        };

        // Process Agora NCS server callbacks to update user registry
        public void HandleNcsEvent(String channelName, int uid, int eventType, long clientSeq) {
            // Check the eventType to process events that notify of users joining or
            // leaving a channel or a change in the user role
            if (eventType != EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN &&
                eventType != EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT &&
                eventType != EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN &&
                eventType != EVENT_AUDIENCE_QUIT &&
                eventType != EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER &&
                eventType != EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE) {
                
                return;
            }

            // Determine whether a user is online
            boolean isOnlineInNotice = IsUserOnlineInNotice(eventType);
            // Get the user role from eventType
            int roleInNotice = GetUserRoleInNotice(eventType);

            Channel channel = channels.get(channelName);
            if (channel == null) {
                // If a channel does not exist, create a channel and add it to the list
                channel = new Channel();
                channels.put(channelName, channel);
                System.out.println("New channel " + channelName + " created");
            }

            User user = channel.users.get(uid);
            // Get whether a user has left a channel
            boolean isQuit = !isOnlineInNotice && (user == null || user.isOnline);
            if (user == null) {
                // Create a new user and add it to the user list of the corresponding channel
                user = new User(uid, roleInNotice, isOnlineInNotice, clientSeq);
                channel.users.put(uid, user);

                if (isOnlineInNotice) {
                    System.out.println("New User " + uid + " joined channel " + channelName);
                } else {
                    // Set a timer for deleting a user's data after the user leaves a channel
                    DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(channelName, uid, clientSeq);
                }
            } else if (clientSeq > user.lastClientSeq) {
                /*
                * If the data for a user already exists, compare the clientSeq
                * of the latest notification with that of the last notification
                * callback handled by your server. If the latest value is greater,
                * update the user data; otherwise, ignore the notification callback.
                */
                user.role = roleInNotice;
                user.isOnline = isOnlineInNotice;
                user.lastClientSeq = clientSeq;

                if (isQuit) {
                    // Mark the status of a user as offline, and delete the user after one minute
                    System.out.println("User " + uid + " quit channel " + channelName);
                    DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(channelName, uid, clientSeq);
                }
            }
        }

        // Set a timer for deleting the data of an offline user
        private void DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(final String channelName, final int uid, final long clientSeq) {
            timer.schedule(new TimerTask() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    Channel channel = channels.get(channelName);
                    if (channel == null) return;
                    User user = channel.users.get(uid);
                    if (user == null) return;

                    // If the value in the clientSeq field changes, do not delete data
                    if (user.lastClientSeq != clientSeq) return;

                    if (!user.isOnline) {
                        // Delete user data only when the user is offline
                        channel.users.remove(uid);
                        System.out.println("Removed user " + uid + " from channel " + channelName);
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("User " + uid + " is online while delayed removing, cancelled");
                    }

                    // If there are no users left in the channel, delete the channel
                    if (channel.users.isEmpty()) {
                        channels.remove(channelName);
                        System.out.println("Removed channel " + channelName);
                    }
                }
            }, WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS);
        }

        // Determine whether a user is online.
        private static boolean IsUserOnlineInNotice(int eventType) {
            return eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE;
        }

        // Get the user role.
        private static int GetUserRoleInNotice(int eventType) {
            if (eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER) {
            return ROLE_BROADCASTER;
            } else {
                return ROLE_AUDIENCE;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Instantiate the `UserRegistry` class

    Add the following code to the `Handlers` class after `public class Handlers {`:

    ```java
    public static UserRegistry userRegistry = new UserRegistry();
    ```

1. To update the user registry when you receive a <Vg k="NCS" /> callback, add the following code to the `handle` method in the `NcsHandler` class after `os.close();`:

    ```java
    // Maintain user registry
    userRegistry.HandleNcsEvent(channelName, uid, eventType, clientSeq);
    ```

When adopting the solutions recommended by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> to maintain user online status, you need to recognize the following:

* The solutions only guarantee eventual consistency of user status.
* To improve accuracy, notification callbacks specific to one channel must be handled in a single process.

### Handle redundant notifications and abnormal user activity
<MaintainStatus />

## Reference

This section contains in depth information about <Vg k="NCS" />

<ChannelEvents />

### IP address query API

If your server that receives notification callbacks is behind a firewall, you need to call the IP address query API to retrieve the IP addresses of <Vg k="NCS" /> and configure your firewall to trust all these IP addresses.

Agora occasionally adjusts the <Vg k="NCS" /> IP addresses. Best practice is to call this endpoint at least every 24 hours and automatically update the firewall configuration.

#### Prototype

* Method: `GET`
* Endpoint: `https://api.agora.io/v2/ncs/ip`

#### Request header

Authorization: You must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the Customer ID and Customer Secret provided by Agora, and then pass the credential to the Authorization field in the HTTP request header. 

#### Request body

This API has no body parameters.

#### Response body

When the request succeeds, the response body looks like the following:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "service": {
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                },
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Each primary IP field shows an IP address of <Vg k="NCS" /> server. When you receive a response, you need to note the primary IP fields and add all these IP addresses to your firewall's allowed IP list.

### Considerations

* The Agora NCS does not guarantee that notification callbacks arrive at your server in the same order as events occur.
* Your server needs to be able to handle messages arriving out of order.
* To improve the reliability of <Vg k="NCS" />, there can be more than one notification callback for each event, and your server needs to be able to handle repeated messages.
