1. Generate a key and salt on your server

    - To generate a random 32-byte hexadecimal key on your server as a string, refer to the following `OpenSSL` command:
    
        ```shell
        # Generate a 32-byte hexadecimal key
        openssl rand -hex 32
        ```

    - To generate a random Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt on your server, refer to the following `OpenSSL` command:
    
        ```shell
        # Generate a Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt
        openssl rand -base64 32
        ```
