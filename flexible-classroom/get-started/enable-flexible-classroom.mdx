        ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641366278596)

    1. Enable the advanced services. See [Enable whiteboard server-side features](/interactive-whiteboard/develop/enable-whiteboard#enable-whiteboard-server-side-features).

    1. Configure a third-party cloud storage service for storing files uploaded in a classroom. Fill in the following information:
          - `region`: The location of the data center you specified when creating a bucket in Amazon S3.
          - `endpoint`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as `s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.
          - `Bucket`: The bucket name in Amazon S3.
          - `folder`: The domain name used to access the Amazon S3 service, such as `whiteboard`.
          - `accessKey`: The Access Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to identify visitors.
          - `secretKey`: The Secret Key provided by Amazon S3, which is used to authenticate signatures.

1. **Configure your classroom**

     1. Find the cloud recording module on the **Flexible Classroom configuration** page in Agora Console:

        ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1641368314262)

    1. Configure storage

        Pass in the `storageConfig` JSON object for storing recorded files. For example:

        ```json
        {
            "vendor": 2,
            "region": 3,
            "bucket": "xxxxx",
            "accessKey": "xxxxxxf",
            "secretKey": "xxxxx",
            "endpoint": "https://agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com",
            "fileNamePrefix": [
                "scenario",
                "recording"
            ]
        }
        ```

        For parameter descriptions, see [storageConfig](../../cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#cloud-storage-configuration).

    1. Configure recording.

       By default, you record teacher audio and video in [composite recording mode](../../cloud-recording/develop/composite-mode). Your recorded files are stored in Agora's Amazon S3 account. To change the default behavior, Pass in the `recordingConfig` JSON object:

        ```json
        {
            "maxIdleTime": 30,
            "streamTypes": 2,
            "channelType": 0
        }
        ```

       For parameter descriptions, see [recordingConfig](/cloud-recording/reference/rest-api/start#recording-configuration).
