This page lists the known issues and limitations of using the Web SDK.

This page is continuously updated as the systems and browsers evolve. Agora suggests you regularly upgrade to the latest version of the SDK, which includes new features, bug fixes and improvements.s

## Desktop

<a name="chrome"></a>

### Chrome

- On all AMD-based and some Intel-based devices with the Windows operating system, if Chrome uses the H.264 codec, the video transmission bitrate may be lower than the set value.
 **Solution:** To resolve this issue, you can set the browser to use the VP8 codec or try to disable hardware acceleration.
- Chrome 84 on macOS has a known issue: When using the H.264 codec, WebRTC can experience a sudden drop in the frame rate. For details, see the official Google bug reports: [Issue 1088650](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1203206&can=2&q=webrtc%20drop%20component%3ABlink%3EWebRTC%3EVideo) and [Issue 12704](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=12704#c3).
 **Solution:** Agora recommends using VP8 instead of H.264 for Chrome 84 and later versions on macOS.
- Acoustic Echo Cancellation(AEC) fails to work on Chrome in certain scenarios.
 **Cause:** If you apply extra processing (for example, spatial audio) to the received remote audio stream, AEC fails to get the AEC Reference signal. For details, see the Chrome [Issue 687574](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=687574).
**Solution:** Agora recommends that all users wear headphones instead of using speakers. To use speakers in this scenario, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).
- Chrome plans to deprecate and remove the Plan B dialect in WebRTC. For details, see the [Chrome feature description](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5823036655665152). If you use any of the following versions of <Vpd k="NAME"/>, best practice is to upgrade to the latest version:

  <ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">

  | Version   | Impact  |
  |---|---|
  | v2.5.0 - v2.9.0 <br></br> v3.0.0 - v3.6.1  |  After a stream is published, calls to `switchDevice` cause video freeze or no sound issues. |
  | v4.0.0 - v4.0.1 |  The `publish` and `subscribe` methods do not have any effect. |

  </ProductWrapper>

  <ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">

  | Version   | Impact  |
  |---|---|
  |  v4.0.0-4.0.1 |  The `publish` and `subscribe` methods do not have any effect. |

  </ProductWrapper>

<a name="safari"></a>

### Safari

- On Mac OS Ventura, when sharing the screen using Safari, the video resolution set by the SDK may be different from the actual captured resolution. If the browser does not support the resolution set by the user, the billing system uses the actual captured   resolution. As a result, the captured resolution may be larger or smaller than the set resolution due to browser restriction.
- On Safari 15.4, if you set the sample rate of the local audio track as 32,000 Hz, the local audio track ends (triggering the `AgoraRTCClient.on('track-ended'` event).
- If you use H.264 on Safari 15.1, setting [MediaStreamTrack.enabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/enabled) as `false` crashes the web tab.
- On Safari 14.0.1, the audio can experience stuttering.
- Safari 13 users may not be able to hear other users.
- Safari 12.1 or earlier only supports the H.264 codec.
- Safari 11 only supports video resolutions of 480P and higher.
- Safari does not support getting the output device information, so it does not support the `getPlayoutDevices` and `setAudioOutput` methods.
- On Safari, when calling APIs to get quality statistics, the values of some properties are 0. For example, when calling `getLocalAudioStats` to get the quality statistics of the local audio track, the value of `sendPacketsLost` is 0.
- If **Auto-Play** is not enabled on Safari (as the following figure shows), the stream playback has no audio. You have to call the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` method to get the device permissions before playing a stream.
  ![img](/images/video-sdk/safari-auto-play.png)
- After creating a screen sharing video track using `createScreenVideoTrack` on Safari 16.2 and 16.3 on macOS Ventura, there may be an issue of a green screen when calling `setEncoderConfiguration` to modify the video resolution of that track. This issue is caused by a fallback in WebKit, as explained in [Bug 254652](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254652). The solution is to upgrade to macOS Ventura 13.3 and Safari 16.4.

<a name="firefox"></a>

### Firefox

- On Firefox 98, when sending H.264 video from Windows devices, the keyframes cannot be received immediately after the video is subscribed, thus slowing down the rendering of the first video frame.
- When the Web SDK on Firefox communicates with the SDK on some devices, the video on Firefox is rotated.
- Firefox does not support changing the frame rate (30 fps by default).
- Firefox does not support setting the audio encoding rate.
- Setting the video profile on Firefox does not take effect on the following devices:
   - MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)
   - Windows 10 (MI)
- On Macs with the Apple M1 chip, Firefox does not support H.264. For details, see the [Firefox documentation](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1686470).
- Firefox does not support getting `CodecType`, `sendFrameRate` and `captureFrameRate`.

### Other restrictions on desktop

- On Chrome 81 or later, Safari, and Firefox, device IDs are only available after the user has granted permission to use the media device. This restriction affects the `getMicrophones`, `getCameras`, and `getPlaybackDevices` methods.
- The `setPlaybackDevice` method is only supported on Chrome. Calling this method on other browsers throws the `NOT_SUPPORTED` error.
- The `setOptimizationMode` method and the `optimizationMode` parameter in `CameraVideoTrackInitConfig`, `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig`, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` are only supported on Chrome.
- Calling `createScreenVideoTrack` to enable screen sharing has the following restrictions:
   - The Web SDK supports screen sharing on Chrome 58 or later. If the Chrome version is earlier than 72, you need to add the [Google Chrome Extension for Screen Sharing](../basic-features/screensharing#screen-sharing-on-chrome) provided by Agora, get the `extensionId`, and set the `extensionId` parameter when you create a video track for screen sharing. If the Chrome version is 72 or later, simply call `createScreenVideoTrack`.
   - The Web SDK supports screen sharing on Firefox 56 or later. Firefox on Windows does not support the `application` mode.
   - The Web SDK supports screen sharing on Edge 80 or later on Windows 10+.
   - The Web SDK supports screen sharing on macOS Safari 13 or later. The end-user can only share the whole screen on Safari.
   - The Web SDK supports sharing the local audio playback when sharing a screen on Chrome 74 or later. To share the audio, set the `withAudio` parameter when calling `createScreenVideoTrack`. On Windows, this function allows you to share the audio when sharing the entire screen and sharing Chrome tabs, but not when sharing the application window. On macOS, this function allows you to share the audio only when sharing Chrome tabs.
- The `setBeautyEffect` method is only supported on the following browsers and versions:

   - Chrome 65 or later.
   - Safari 12 or later.
   - Firefox 70.0.1 or later.

## Mobile

### iOS known issues

<details>
<summary>iOS 16.0: The video is stretched after the screen changes to a certain orientation</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 16.0, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Reason**: Due to the regression of the WebRTC module of WebKit on iOS 16.0, RTP streaming with coordination of video orientation (CVO) does not work properly, which causes the video to be stretched after rotation.

**Workaround**: Agora recommends that you add a prompt to remind users of this issue.

</details>

<details>
<summary>iOS 15.1.x: The browser crashes when sending the H.264 video stream</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 15.1.x, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Details**: If you set `codec` as `'h264'` when calling `createClient`, the browsers on iOS 15.1.x crash after you send the video stream.

**Reason**: This issue happens due to the regression of the WebKit video encoder on iOS 15.1.x. For details, see [WebKit Bug 231505](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231505).

**Workaround**: Use the VP8 codec for video encoding.

```javascript
createClient({codec:'vp8', mode})
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>iOS 15.x: The actual bitrate of sending the H.264 video stream is lower than expected</summary>

**Impact**: Safari on iOS 15.x

**Reason**: The issue occurs because **WebRTC H264 LowLatency encoder** is enabled by default for Safari on iOS 15.x. For details, see [Webkit bug 238366](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238366).

**Workaround**: The following workarounds are available:
- Use the VP8 codec for video encoding. The sample code is as follows:

  ```javascript
  createClient({codec:'vp8', mode})
  ```
- On the iOS device, go to **Settings** > **Safari** > **Advanced** > **Experimental Features**, and disable **WebRTC H264 LowLatency encoder**.
</details>

<details>
   <summary>iOS 15.0 to 15.3: Low audio volume</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 15.0 to 15.3, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Details**: On iOS 15.0 to 15.3, after the local user subscribes to the `RemoteAudioTrack` and plays it, sometimes the audio is routed to the earpiece instead of the speaker, and the volume that the local user hear may be very low.

**Reason**: This issue happens due to the regression of the WebKit audio module on iOS 15.0 to 15.3. For details, see [ WebKit Bug 230902](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230902).

**Workaround**: On iOS 15.0 to 15.3, use `WebAudio` to play the audio, and use `GainNode` to increase the audio volume level. Use the following workaround:
1. Upgrade to the Web SDK 4.9.0 or later versions.
2. Set the SDK private parameter `REMOTE_AUDIO_TRACK_USES_WEB_AUDIO` as `true`. The SDK uses `WebAudio` to play the remote audio stream. Sample code:
   ```javascript
   function isIOS15(ua){
       // Use UA to judge whether the iOS version is 15
   }

   if(isIOS15(navigator.userAgent)){
       // If you are using Typescript, add the "@ts-ignore" tag before calling setParameter
       // @ts-ignore
       AgoraRTC.setParameter("REMOTE_AUDIO_TRACK_USES_WEB_AUDIO", true);
   }
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>iOS 15.x: The video playback goes black</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 15.x, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Details**: On iOS 15.x, if you play the video in DOM node and add some CSS properties (such as `transform` and `animation`) to the` video` element or its parent element, or if you change the CSS properties to redraw the video rendering area, sometimes the video goes black.

**Reason**: This issue happens due to the regression of the WebKit video renderer on iOS 15.x. For details, see [WebKit Bug 230902](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230902).

**Workaround**: Upgrade to the Web SDK v4.7.3 or later and minimize changes to the CSS properties of the `video` element and its parent elements.
</details>


<details>
<summary>iOS 15.x: If a user wears a Bluetooth headset, the audio may be significantly distorted</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 15.x, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Reason**: This issue happens due to the regression of the WebKit audio playback module on iOS 15.x. For details, see [WebKit Bug 231422](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231422).

**Workaround**: Agora recommends that you add a prompt to remind users of possible audio distortion issues when they use a Bluetooth headset.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Backgrounding the browser or app causes the audio streaming to be cut off.</summary>
<p>

**Impact**: 
- Safari on iOS 15.x.
- Browsers and apps that use WKWebView (such as Chrome) on iOS 14.4 to iOS 15.x.
</p>
<p>

**Reason**: 
- For Safari: This happens primarily due to this WebKit [bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231105). After the browser switches to the background, the `AudioContext` of `WebAudio` stops processing audio.
- For browsers and apps using WKWebView: This happens because iOS `WKWebView` prohibits microphone usage while in the background. For details, see [Microphone gets muted in background](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/689182).
</p>
<p>

**Workaround**: Currently there is no workaround for browsers and apps using WKWebView. For Safari on iOS 15.x, you can follow these steps to avoid this issue:
1. Upgrade to the Web SDK v4.7.3 or later versions.
2. When calling `createMicrophoneAudioTrack`, set `bypassWebAudio` as `true`. The Web SDK directly publishes the local audio stream without processing it through `WebAudio`.

   ```javascript
   const localAudioTrack = await AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack({bypassWebAudio: true});
   ```

   > Note that this workaround has a side effect. After applying this workaround, the audio mixing function (`MixingAudioTrack`) in the SDK fails.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>iOS 15.x: Audio and video playback might not resume automatically after being interrupted by a system phone call, another real-time interaction app, Siri, or an alarm.</summary>

**Impact**: All browsers and apps that use WKWebView on iOS 15.x, such as Safari and Chrome.

**Reason**: Such interruptions can cause the state of the `video` and `audio` elements to be `paused`. After the interruption finishes, the state cannot be automatically switched back to `playing`, and even calling `HTMLMediaElement.play` cannot resume the media playback. See the WebKit bug [232599](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232599) and [226698](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226698) for more details.
**Workaround**: Upgrade to the Web SDK v4.7.3 or later versions. The SDK attempts to resume media playback after the interruption. Agora recommends that you add a prompt that instructs users to refresh the page.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Other known issues</summary>

- The volume of a remote user can change randomly on iOS 13 and 14.
- Switching between the front and rear cameras can momentarily rotate the video.
- The audio routing can change randomly. Sometimes, the audio is routed to the speakerphone when a headset is connected or to the earpiece when no headset is connected.
- If you call `getUserMedia` twice to get two tracks of the same media type, the first track goes muted or black.
- After a user switches to another app that uses the microphone or camera (such as Siri or Skype) and then switches back, the audio sampling or video capture fails.
</details>

### iOS known limitations

<details>
<summary>The <code>createScreenVideoTrack</code> method is not supported</summary>

Reason: iOS Safari and WKWebView do not support the `mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia` method.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The <code>setBeautyEffect</code> method is not supported</summary>

Reason: WebGL is not well supported on iOS Safari and WKWebView, and the image enhancement algorithm can reduce the system performance below acceptable levels.
</details>

<details>
<summary><code>The IBufferSourceAudioTrack.seekAudioBuffer</code> method is not supported</summary>

Reason: `WebAudio` on iOS does not support this method.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cannot send H.264 video streams with a resolution of 1080p or higher</summary>

Reason: The Web SDK uses the H.264 Baseline Profile for negotiation, so encoding and sending a video stream with a resolution of 1080p or higher is not supported on iOS.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When sending a low-quality stream on iOS Safari, you cannot set <code>LowStreamParameter.bitrate</code>, and the resolution of the low-quality stream must be proportional to the resolution of the high-quality stream.</summary>

Reason: iOS Safari and WkWebView do not support setting the frame rate with the `RTCRTPSender.setParameters` method. After compressing the resolution with the `scaleResolutionDownBy` property, the resolution of the low-quality stream stays proportional to the resolution of the high-quality stream.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The <code>encodeDelay</code> property is not supported</summary>

Reason: The `encodeDelay` property cannot be calculated through the `getStats` method of WebRTC on iOS.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Backgrounding the browser or app causes the user's video to display as a black screen</summary>

Reason: iOS `AVCaptureSession` prohibits camera usage while in the background. For details, see [AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReason](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesessioninterruptionreason/avcapturesessioninterruptionreasonvideodevicenotavailableinbackground?preferredLanguage=occ) or [Chromium issue 4294](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=4294).
</details>

<details>
<summary> Calling <code>RemoteAudioTrack.setVolume</code> has no effect on the playback volume of the remote audio</summary>

Reason: iOS and iOS WebView do not support setting the volume of a media object through the `HTMLMediaElement.volume` property.
</details>


### Android known issues

<details>
<summary>Android 12: Video distortion on Chrome when hardware acceleration is enabled</summary>

**Impact**: The Chrome browser or Chromium kernel browser 97 or earlier on certain devices with Android 12, such as Pixel 3 and Pixel 4.

**Details**: If the Chrome browser on Android 12 enables the WebRTC `H264` or `VP8` hardware acceleration by default, video distortion can occur.

**Reason**: This issue happens due to the regression of the Chromium WebRTC video encoder. For details, see [Chromium issue 1237677](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1237677).

**Workaround**: Chrome 97 fixed this issue. You can instruct users to upgrade to Chrome 97 or later versions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The bitrate when sending video on Android Chrome fails to reach the preset value.</summary>

**Scope**: Certain Android devices, such as Xiaomi and OnePlus.

**Reason**: This is a hardware encoder issue. The bitrate fails to reach the preset value at a specific video encoding frame rate.

**Workaround**: In most cases, the bitrate is relatively lower when the frame rate is set as 15 fps. If you set the frame rate as 30 fps, the bitrate increases. So Agora recommends trying to set the frame rate as 30 fps when encountering a bitrate issue. However, setting the frame rate as fps may cause performance issues.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The autoplay of inaudible media is blocked on WeChat</summary>

**Impact**: The WeChat browser using Chromium 89 kernel

**Details**: The autoplay of inaudible media is blocked. Even after the user interacts with the webpage to resume the video playback, the autoplay block is still not removed.

**Reason**: This issue happens because the WeChat browser implements a custom autoplay policy.

**Workaround**: Follow these steps to avoid this issue:
1. Upgrade to the Web SDK v4.6.0 or later versions.
2. Listen to the `AgoraRTC.onAutoplayFailed` event. Instruct the user to click on the page to resume playback:

   ```javascript
   AgoraRTC.onAutoplayFailed = ()=>{
       document.alert('Please click the page to resume playback');
   }
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>If a local user wears a Bluetooth headset, after they start to send the audio, the remote audio is lost</summary>

**Scope**: Certain Xiaomi and OnePlus devices

**Details**: If a local user wears a Bluetooth headset, when the Bluetooth headset starts capturing the audio, there is a possibility that the remote audio is lost.

**Reason**: It may be due to the audio issue on Chromium regarding the profile switch of the Bluetooth.

**Workaround**: Agora recommends that you add a prompt to remind users of possible audio-loss issues when they use a Bluetooth headset.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When a local user is sending audio, switching the audio output device does not take effect</summary>


**Scope**: Chromium-based browsers on Android devices


**Details**: When a local users is sending audio, if the user switches from using the speaker to using a Bluetooth headset, the remote audio still comes from the speaker.


**Reason**: The audio routing on Android devices is controlled by the Android operating system and cannot be fixed at Chromium's level. For details, see [Chromium issue 1317548](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1317548&q=bluetooth&can=2)。
</details>


<details>
<summary>Issues specific to certain Android devices</summary>

- On devices equipped with **MediaTek chips**, the Web SDK cannot encode and send video streams in H.264.
- On devices equipped with Huawei **HiSilicon Kirin** chips, if you use Chrome versions earlier than 88, the Web SDK cannot encode and send video streams in H.264.
- When receiving video streams on Chrome on **OnePlus 6**, if the screen turns off, the video can freeze.
- **Harmony OS** does not support sending the video stream of 180p.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Other known issues</summary>

- On some Android devices, the device labels might not be available.
- On some Android devices, tracks can end if the audio and video streams are interrupted by system phone calls or other audio or video calling apps. To resume the call, the Web SDK needs to re-capture the audio and video.
- On Android Chrome, the Web SDK cannot send high-quality and low-quality streams in H.264.
- On Android Chrome earlier than 90, the volume obtained by `getVolumeLevel` is 0, but the user can hear the audio.
- On Android system Webview versions from 55 to 75, the `decodeFrameRate` property stays 0.
</details>
