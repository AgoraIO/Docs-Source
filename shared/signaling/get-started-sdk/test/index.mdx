In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID. You create a token for each user in the channel. Each user must log in from a different instance of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
To test <Vg k="MESS" />, you run 2 or more instances of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. When you call `login` using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same as you used to create the token.

For each user in your tests:

1. **[Generate a temporary token](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/)**.


1. **Configure the project**

    1. <OpenConfig/>
    1. <SetAppId/>
    1. <SetToken/>
    1. <SetAuthenticationMethod/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test stream channels**:

    1. For each user, open a new instance of the reference app.
    1. Choose the **Stream Channels** example.
    1. Log in to <Vg k="MESS" />, then send and receive messages using topics in channels.
