The <Vpd k="NAME" /> playground provides an interactive environment for testing and configuring AI agents. It enables you to :

- Experiment with different AI models, TTS/STT systems, and real-time communication tools.
- Test agent behavior in a safe, interactive environment.
- Select and configure extensions from a range of prebuilt modules.

This guide walks you through setting up and running the playground to experiment with different AI models, speech services, and communication tools.

## Prerequisites

- **Agora credentials** 

    Obtain an [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) and [App Certificate](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

- **Development environment**  
    Install one of the following:

    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended)
    - [Node.js(LTS) v18](https://nodejs.org/en)

- **System requirements**

    - CPU: Dual-core processor or higher
    - Memory: 4 GB RAM minimum

## Set up playground

### Clone the repository

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework.git
cd ten-framework/ai_agents
```

### Configure environment

1. Create a `.env` file from the template:

    ```sh 
    cp ./.env.example ./.env
    ```

1. Open `.env` and add your Agora credentials:

    ```bash title=".env"
    AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
    AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_certificate_here
    ```

### Start Docker containers

Run the `docker` command to compose containers:

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up -d
```

## Build and run 

1. Enter the development container

    ```bash 
    docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash
    ```

1. Build the agent

    Use the following command to build the agent:

    ```bash 
    task use
    ```

1. Start the web server


    ```bash 
    task run
    ```

### Configure your agent

The playground interface allows you to test different configurations and see results in real-time. Each graph type supports specific extensions and capabilities - Voice Agent for speech interactions, Realtime Agent for low-latency communication.

To get started:

1. Open the playground at `http://localhost:3000`

1. Configure your agent:

    1. Select a graph type (Voice Agent or Realtime Agent) from the dropdown.

    1. Click the module configuration button. Select extension modules such as STT, TTS, and LLM from the panel. The system saves settings to `property.json` when you click **Save changes**. For further details, see [Configure modules](../config/modules).

    1. Click the settings button to configure extensions with required API keys and parameters. For further details, see [Configure properties](../config/properties).

    1. To configure STT and TTS languages, see [Configure languages](../config/change-language).

### Modify the code directly
You can edit the configuration files directly if you prefer manual control. Open `agents/property.json`, locate the graph you want to modify, and update any values.
After saving your changes, refresh the playground page and reconnect to the agent. Your changes take effect immediately.
