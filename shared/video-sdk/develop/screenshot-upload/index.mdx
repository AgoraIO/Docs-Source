To meet the needs of video content supervision, Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to take screenshots of the
video stream in a channel and then upload these images to third-party cloud storage.

## Understand the tech

When you enable screenshot upload, you set the interval between screenshots. After each interval <Vg k="VSDK" />
takes a screenshot of the video stream sent by local users, and uploads the image to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. <Vg
k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uploads each screenshot to your third-party cloud storage and sends a callback notification to
your server in the form of an `HTTPS` request.
