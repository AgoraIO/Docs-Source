This page provides detailed help for the Flexible Classroom RESTful APIs.

## Basic information

### Server

All requests are sent to the host: api.agora.io.

### Data format

The Content-Type of all requests is application/json.

### Authentication

Flexible Classroom Cloud Service uses tokens for authentication. You need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` and `x-agora-uid` fields when sending your HTTP request:

- The <Vg k="SIG"/> token generated at your server.
- The uid you use to generate the <Vg k="SIG"/> token.

For details, see [Generate an RTM Token](/signaling/develop/authentication-workflow).
