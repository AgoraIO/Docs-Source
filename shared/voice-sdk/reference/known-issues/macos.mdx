- MacOS SDK v4.4.0

    **MacOS 15 Sequoia beta system issue**

    When the app path (including the App name) contains non-English characters (such as Chinese characters), the compiled `Metal shader library` may not contain any methods, causing the app to crash. See [this article](../../help/other-issues/macos_15_beta) for the workaround.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
As of v4.5.0, both <Vpd k="SDK" /> and Signaling SDK (v2.2.0 and above) include the `aosl.xcframework` library. If you manually integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> via CDN and also use Signaling SDK, delete the earlier version of the `aosl.xcframework` library to avoid conflicts.
