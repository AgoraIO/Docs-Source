### 4. Generate a token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using [tokens](../reference/glossary.html#token) to authenticate users logging in to an RTM system.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating RTM tokens. To generate an RTM token:

1.  Visit https://webdemo.agora.io/token-builder.

2.  Fill in the App ID, App certificate, and user ID to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />. You need to specify the user ID yourself (for example, "test"). The generated RTM token is showed on the screen. When calling the `login` method later, ensure that the user ID is the same with the one that you use to generate the RTM token.

### 5. Install dependencies and run the sample project

Refer to the following steps to integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> into the sample project:

1.  Download the [RTM](https://github.com/AgoraIO/RTM) repository on Github, and locate the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Web` folder.

2.  Go to the directory of the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Web` folder, and run the following command to install dependencies:

           $ npm install

3.  Run the following command to run the sample project:

           $ npm run dev

4.  After the project runs successfully, enter your App ID and token to try the project.

    You must log in with the user ID you entered to generate the token.

## Expected result

When the sample project runs successfully, you can see the following interface. You can enter the same App ID, Account Name (user ID) and temporary token to join the same channel and communicate with the remote user.
