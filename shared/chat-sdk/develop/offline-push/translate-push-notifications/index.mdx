Push notifications work in conjunction with the translation feature. If a user enables the auto-translate feature and sends a message, the SDK will send both the original message and the translated message.

A recipient can set the preferred language for push notifications. If the language of the translated message matches their setting, the translated message is displayed in the push notification bar; otherwise, the original message is displayed.

The following sample code shows how to set and get the preferred language for push notifications:

<Android />
<Ios />
<Web />
<Flutter />
<ReactNative />
