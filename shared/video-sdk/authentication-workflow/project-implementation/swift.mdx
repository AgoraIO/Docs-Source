import FetchToken from '@docs/assets/code/video-sdk/authentication-workflow/swift/fetch-token.mdx';

1.  **Add the required import statements**

    In `ViewController`, add the following lines after the last `import` statement:

    ``` swift
    import Foundation
    import Dispatch
    ```

2.  **Add variables for your connection to the token server**

    Declare the variables you need to generate the token. In `ViewController`. replace:

    ``` swift
    // Update with the temporary token generated in Agora Console.
    var token = "<#the token you added when you tested your app#>"

    // Update with the channel name you used to generate the token in Agora Console.
    var channelName = "<#the channel name you added when you tested your app#>"
    ```

    With:

    <AddVariables />

    Make sure you specify the token-server URL in exactly the same format as shown in the example.

3.  **Enable the user to specify a channel**

    Add a text box to the user interface. To implement this, In `ViewController`, copy the following code at the beginning of the `initViews()` function:

    <SpecifyChannel />

4.  **Retrieve a token from the server**

    Use a GET request to retrieve an authentication token for a specific channel from the token server, then decode the return parameters to obtain the token.

    In `ViewController` class, add the following `fetchToken` method:

    <FetchToken />

5.  **Join a channel using the token**

    Use the retrieved token to either join a channel or to renew an expiring token.

    In `ViewController`, replace the following `joinChannel` code:

    ``` swift
    // Join the channel with a temp token. Pass in your token and channel name here
    let result = agoraEngine.joinChannel(
        byToken: token, channelId: channelName, uid: 0, mediaOptions: option,
        joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in }
    )
    // Check if joining the channel was successful and set joined Bool accordingly
    if (result == 0) {
        joined = true
        showMessage(title: "Success", text: "Successfully joined the channel as \(self.userRole)")
    }
    ```

    With:

    ``` swift
    if !fetchToken() {
        return
    }
    // If already joined to a channel, renew the expiring token. If not, join a channel passing fetched token saved in token variable.
    if joined {
        agoraEngine.renewToken(token)
    } else {
        let result = agoraEngine.joinChannel(
            byToken: self.token, channelId: self.channelName, uid: 0, mediaOptions: option,
            joinSuccess: { (channel, uid, elapsed) in }
        )
        // Check if joining the channel was successful and set joined Bool accordingly
        if (result == 0) {
            joined = true
            showMessage(title: "Success", text: "Successfully joined the channel as \(self.userRole)")
        }
    }
    ```

6.  **Handle the event triggered by <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> when the token is about to expire**

    A token expires after the `expireTime` specified in the call to the token server or after 24 hours, if `expireTime` is not specified. The `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` event handler receives a callback when the current token is about to expire. Your event handler retrieves a fresh token and persists the connection with <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

    In `extension ViewController: AgoraRtcEngineDelegate {`, add the following event handler function:

    ``` swift
    // Handle the event triggered by {AGORA_BACKEND} when the token is about to expire
    func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, tokenPrivilegeWillExpire token: String) {
        joinChannel()
        showMessage(title: "Authentication", text: "Token renewed")
    }
    ```
