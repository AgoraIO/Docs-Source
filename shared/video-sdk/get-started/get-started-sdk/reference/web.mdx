### Next steps

After implementing the quickstart sample, read the following documents to learn more:

* The sample code in this document uses a temporary token to join a channel. To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, best practice is to obtain a token from an authentication server. For details, see [Secure authentication with tokens](./get-started/authentication-workflow).

### Sample project

Agora provides open source sample projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Shengwang-Lab/API-Examples-Web) for your reference. Download or view the [sample project](https://github.com/Shengwang-Lab/API-Examples-Web/tree/main/src/example) for a more detailed example.


### Other integration methods

Using npm to integrate the Web SDK also supports turning on Tree shaking to reduce the size of the app after integrating the SDK. For details, see [Using Tree shaking](.).

In addition to using npm to obtain the Web SDK, you can also use the following methods to integrate the SDK:

* In the project HTML file, add the following code to obtain the SDK using the CDN method:

    ```html
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTC_N-4.20.0.js"></script>
    ```

* Download the <Vpd k="SDK"/> package locally, save the `.js` files in the SDK package to the project directory, and then add the following code to the project HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="./AgoraRTC_N-4.20.0.js"></script>
    ```

### Frequently asked questions

#### Why do I get a `digital envelope routines::unsupported` error when running the quickstart project locally?

This issue arises because the quickstart project, which is configured with webpack for local execution, is affected by changes in Node.js 16 and above. The modifications in Node.js, particularly in its dependency on OpenSSL (detailed in the [node issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29817)), impact the local development environment dependencies of the project (refer to the [webpack issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532) for specifics). 

Use one of the following solutions to resolve the issue:

* Run the following command to set a temporary environment variable (Recommended):

    ```shell
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
    ```

* Temporarily switch to a lower version of Node.js.
