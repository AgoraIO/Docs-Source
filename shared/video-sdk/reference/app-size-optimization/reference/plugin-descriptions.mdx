#### PVC insert

PVC (Perceptual Video Coding) is a video coding method that reduces bandwidth consumption while ensuring the same image quality. Use it to improve video fluency in scenarios with limited bandwidth, and reduce traffic consumption in mobile network scenarios. If you need to use this function, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

<Admonition type="warning" title="warn">
Since v4.1.0, the SDK statically compiles the PVC library by default, and no longer provides plugins. If you have integrated the PVC plugin, you need to remove the PVC plugin from the project dependencies and recompile the project after upgrading.

#### Face capture plugin

Since v4.3.0, the SDK provides a facial capture plug-in, which is used to obtain face-related information such as facial expressions, head rotation, and head translation, and can be used to drive virtual human expression changes and head movements. If you need to use this function, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unity">
#### Face recognition plugin

Agora provides a face recognition plugin since v4.1.1, that recognizes faces or portraits through face or virtual background segmentation algorithms. It uses higher-quality encoding for the ROI (Region of Interest) area during the encoding process to achieve sharper face or portrait effect. If you need to use this function, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

#### Super resolution plugin

After integrating the super-resolution plugin, you can call `enableRemoteSuperResolution` to increase the resolution of the remote video.

Since v4.1.1, the SDK statically compiles the super-resolution library by default. It no longer provides a plugin method. If you have previously integrated the super-resolution plugin, you need to remove it from the project dependencies and recompile the project after upgrading.

<Admonition type="warning" title="warn">
Starting from v4.1.1, the SDK now statically compiles the super-resolution library by default and no longer provides a plug-in method. The `enableRemoteSuperResolution` API has been removed. As a result, enabling super-resolution no longer requires explicit API calls.
