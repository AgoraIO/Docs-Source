When using <Vg k="NCS" /> to maintain the online status of your app users, your server might experience the following issues:

* **Message notifications are redundant**. You receive multiple notifications because the Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> server can send more than one notification callback for each channel event to ensure reliability of the service.

* **Message notifications arrive out of order**. Network issues cause callbacks to arrive at your server in a different order than the order of event occurrence.

To accurately maintain the online status of users, your server needs to be able to deal with redundant notifications and handle received notifications in the same order as events occur. The following section shows you how to use channel event callbacks to accomplish this.

#### Handle redundant or out of order notifications

Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> sends RTC channel event callbacks to your server. All channel events, except for `101` and `102` events, contain the `clientSeq` field (Unit64) in `payload`, which represents the sequence number of an event. This field is used to identify the order in which events occur on the app client. For notification callbacks reporting the activities of the same user, the value of the `clientSeq` field increases as events happen.

Refer to the following steps to use the `clientSeq` field to enable your server to handle redundant messages, and messages arriving out of order:

1. Enable Agora <Vg k="NCS" />, and subscribe to RTC channel event callbacks. Best practice is to subscribe to the following event types according to your scenario:

    * In the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile: `103`, `104`, `105`, `106`, `111`, and `112`.
    * In the `COMMUNICATION` profile: `107` and `108`.

1. Use the channel event callbacks to get the latest status updates about the following at your server:

    * Channel lists
    * User lists in each channel
    * Data for each user, including the user ID, user role, whether the user is in a channel, and `clientSeq` of channel events

1. When receiving notification callbacks of a user, search for the user in the user lists. If there is no data for the user, create data specific to the user.

1. Compare the value in the `clientSeq` field of the latest notification callback you receive with that of the last notification callback handled by your server:

    * If the former is greater than the latter, the notification callback needs to be handled.
    * If the former is less than the latter, the notification callback should be ignored.

1. When receiving notification callbacks reporting a user leaving a channel, wait for one minute before deleting the user data. If it is deleted immediately, your server cannot handle notifications in the same order as channel events happen when receiving redundant notifications or notifications out of order.

#### Deal with abnormal user activities

When your server receives a notification callback of event `104` with reason as `999`, it means that the user is considered to have abnormal activities due to frequent login and logout actions. In this case, best practice is that your server calls the Banning user privileges API to remove the user from the current channel one minute after receiving such notification callback; otherwise, the notification callbacks your server receives about the user's events might be redundant or arrive out of order, which makes it hard for you to accurately maintain the online status of this user.
