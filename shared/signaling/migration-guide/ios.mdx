This page describes the library changes of the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> for iOS, and how to upgrade to v1.4.5 from versions with the static library.

## Library changes
Since v1.4.5, the SDK changes from a static library to a dynamic library, and the XCFramework integration is used. You can go to [SDK Downloads]({rootdir}/reference/downloads.html) to download the v1.4.5 SDK. The following table lists the libraries among different versions:

| SDK version        | Library name              | Library type    |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1.4.5 or later     | `AgoraRtmKit.xcframework` | Dynamic library |
| Earlier than 1.4.5 | `AgoraRtmKit.framework`   | Static library  |

## Upgrade from versions earlier than 1.4.5 to 1.4.5

1.  Copy `AgoraRtmKit.xcframework` from the v1.4.5 SDK to the path of your project and replace the original one.

2.  Open Xcode (take Xcode 11.0 as an example), go to the **TARGETS &gt; Project Name &gt; General &gt; Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu, and click **-** to remove the following libraries:

    -   AgoraRtmKit.framework

    -   libc++.tbd

    -   libresolv.tbd

    -   SystemConfiguration.framework

    -   CoreTelephony.framework

    -   CoreWLAN.framework (only for macOS)

3.  Change the **Embed** attribute of `AgoraRtmKit.xcframework`.
