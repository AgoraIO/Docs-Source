To manage audio mixing and sound effects, <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides the following APIs:

| Function | Sound effect | Audio mixing |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Play or stop playing a specific audio file     | `preloadEffect`<br/> `unloadEffect`<br/> `playEffect`<br/> `stopEffect`<br/> `stopAllEffects`  | `startAudioMixing`<br/> `stopAudioMixing`       |
| Pause or resume playing an audio file          | `pauseEffect`<br/> `pauseAllEffects`<br/> `resumeEffect`<br/> `resumeAllEffects` | `pauseAudioMixing`<br/> `resumeAudioMixing`    |
| Get and adjust playback position and volume   | `setEffectPosition`<br/> `getEffectCurrentPosition`<br/> `getEffectsVolume`<br/> `setEffectsVolume`<br/> `setVolumeOfEffect` | `getAudioMixingCurrentPosition`<br/> `setAudioMixingPosition`<br/> `getAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`<br/> `getAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`<br/> `adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume` |
| Report playback status of audio files          | `rtcEngineDidAudioEffectFinish`                       | `audioMixingStateChanged`                    |

### Play sound effects

Before joining a channel, call `preloadEffect`to preload the sound effect file. After joining the channel, call `playEffect` to play the specified sound effect. Call `playEffect` multiple times to set multiple sound effect IDs and play multiple files simultaneously. After the sound effect has finished playing, the SDK triggers the `rtcEngineDidAudioEffectFinish` callback.

   ```swift
   // Set the effect ID as a unique identifier for the audio effect file
   let EFFECT_ID:Int32 = 1
   // Specify the path to the audio effect file
   let filePath = "your filepath"
   // If you want to play the effect repeatedly, you need to preload the audio effect file into memory. Do not preload if the file size is large
   // You can only preload local audio effect files
   agoraKit.preloadEffect(EFFECT_ID, filePath: filePath)

   // Set the number of times the effect will loop. -1 means infinite loop
   int loopCount = -1;
   // Set the pitch of the effect. 1 means the original pitch
   let pitch = 1
   // Set the spatial position of the effect. 0.0 means the effect is in front
   let pan = 1
   // Set the volume of the effect. 100 means the original volume
   let gain = 100.0
   // Set whether to publish the effect to the remote end
   let publish = true
   // Call playEffect to play the specified audio effect file
   // Multiple calls to playEffect can set multiple effect IDs to play multiple audio effect files simultaneously
   agoraKit.playEffect(EFFECT_ID, filePath: filePath, loopCount: Int32(loopCount), pitch: pitch, pan: pan, gain: gain, publish: publish)

   // Pause or resume playing the audio effect file
   agoraKit.pauseEffect(EFFECT_ID)
   agoraKit.resumeEffect(EFFECT_ID)

   // Set the playback position of the specified local audio effect file
   agoraKit.setEffectPosition(EFFECT_ID, pos: 500)

   // Set the playback volume for all audio effect files
   agoraKit.setEffectsVolume(volume: 50.0)
   // Set the playback volume for the specified audio effect file
   agoraKit.setVolumeOfEffect(EFFECT_ID, volume: 50.0)

   // Unload the preloaded audio effect file
   agoraKit.unloadEffect(EFFECT_ID)
   // Pause playing all audio effect files
   agoraKit.stopAllEffects()

   // Trigger this callback when the audio effect file finishes playing
   func rtcEngineDidAudioEffectFinish(_engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit soundId: soundId)
   ```

### Incorporate audio mixing

Before or after joining a channel, call `startAudioMixing` to play the audio file. When the audio mixing status changes, the SDK triggers the `audioMixingStateChanged` callback and reports the reason for the change. 

To mix in an audio file, refer to the following code example:

```swift
// Specify the path to the local or online music file
let filePath = "your file path"
// Set whether to play the music file only locally. false means both local and remote users can hear the music file
let loopback = false
// The number of times the music file will loop. 1 means play only once
let cycle = 1
// Set the starting position of the music file playback
let startPos = 0
// Call the startAudioMixing method to play the music file
agoraKit.startAudioMixing(filePath, loopback: loopback, cycle: cycle, startPos: startPos)

// This callback is triggered when the music file playback status changes
// After receiving the localAudioMixingStateDidChanged callback, Agora recommends calling other music mixing APIs, such as pauseAudioMixing or getAudioMixingDuration
func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit,
               audioMixingStateChanged state: AgoraAudioMixingStateType,
               reasonCode: AgoraAudioMixingReasonCode) {
}

// Pause or resume playback of the music file
agoraKit.pauseAudioMixing()
agoraKit.resumeAudioMixing()

// Get the total duration of the current music file
agoraKit.getAudioMixingDuration()
// Set the playback position of the current music file. 500 means start playing from 500 ms into the music file
agoraKit.setAudioMixingPosition(pos: 500)

// Adjust the playback volume of the current music file on the remote end
agoraKit.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume: 50)
// Adjust the playback volume of the current music file locally
agoraKit.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume: 50)
```

Control playback using the following methods:

- `pauseAudioMixing`: Pause playback.
- `resumeAudioMixing`: Resume playback.
- `stopAudioMixing`: Stop playing.
- `setAudioMixingPosition`: Set the playing position of the current audio file.
- `adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume`: Adjust the volume of the current audio file played locally.
- `adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume`: Adjust the volume of the current audio file played at the remote end.
