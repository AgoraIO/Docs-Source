## Version differences and upgrade advantages

### Version history

Version 5.x includes two sub-versions:

- **5.x v1**: The original version, with a more complex request structure and deeply nested parameter configurations.
- **5.x v2**: An optimized version with a flatter structure, more closely aligned with version 6.x.

Version 7.x is the latest recommended release. It offers several key improvements over version 5.x:

- **Simplified API workflow**: Removes the need to obtain a `builderToken` through the `acquire` interface.
- **Consistent API naming**: Follows RESTful naming conventions.
- **Extended functionality**: Adds support for configuring language settings by UID.
- **Standardized URL paths**: Retains the same domain (`api.agora.io`) but introduces a more structured path format.


## Major changes

### API endpoint and method name changes

| `5.x`   | `7.x`   | Summary |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `acquire` | This method has been removed. | The process of obtaining `builderToken` through the `acquire` interface has been removed in version 7.x. |
| `stop` | `leave` | Method for stopping a task has been renamed to `leave`. |
| `start` | `join` | The method for starting an STT task has been renamed to `join`. |
| `update` | `update` | The method name remains unchanged. |
| `query` | `get` | The method for querying task status has been renamed to `get`. |

### URL path changes

| API | v5.x URL | v7.x URL |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Start task  | `https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks?builderToken={{tokenName}}`  | `https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/join` |
| Query status  | `https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks/{{taskId}}?builderToken={{tokenName}}`  | `https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/agents/{agent_id}` |
| Stop task  | `https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks/{{taskId}}?builderToken={{tokenName}}`  | `https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/agents/{agent_id}/leave` |
| Update configuration | `https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks/{{taskId}}?builderToken={{tokenName}}`	| `https://api.agora.io/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/agents/{agent_id}/update` |

### Parameter changes

- Task identifier changes
    - 5.x: Uses `taskId to` identify tasks
    - 7.x: Uses `agent_id` to identify tasks

- Authentication method changes
    - 5.x: Need to first call `acquire` to obtain a `builderToken`. Subsequent requests are passed through URL parameters.
    - 7.x: Removes the process of obtaining a `builderToken` through the `acquire` interface, simplifying the API call steps.

#### Request parameter changes  

- Structural differences between 5.x v1 and 7.x:

    - In 5.x v1, the API uses deeply nested structures such as `audio.agoraRtcConfig` and `config.recognizeConfig`.
    - In 7.x, the API uses a flatter structure with top-level fields such as `languages`, `rtcConfig`, and `captionConfig`.

- Structural changes between 5.x v2 and 7.x (minor changes):

    - The overall structure remains the same, with only minor updates to API names and paths.

- Added parameters to the `join` method (formerly `start`):

    - `name`: Required. A unique task name within 64 characters. This parameter is used for task deduplication to ensure that only one speech-to-text task runs in the same channel. To run multiple speech-to-text tasks in a channel, set different `name` values.
    - `uidLanguagesConfig`: Optional. Allows you to configure different languages for specific UIDs, providing greater flexibility.

#### Other changes

- URL path standardization: Version 7.x uses the same domain name (`api.agora.io`) but introduces a more standardized path structure, such as `/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/`.
- HTTP method standardization: Some methods, such as `stop`, now use `POST` instead of `DELETE` to better comply with RESTful conventions.
- Return value format: Version 7.x return values include more detailed task status information.

## Migration steps

### Migrate from 5.x v1 to 7.x

There are large differences between the API structure of 5.x v1 and 7.x. The migration steps are as follows:

#### Update API call process

**Version 5.x v1**

1. Call `acquire` to get a `builderToken`.
2. Use the `builderToken` to call `start` and begin the task.
3. Call `query` to check the task status.
4. Call `stop` to end the task.

**Version 7.x**

1. Call `join` to start the task and get the `agent_id`.
2. Call `get` to check the task status.
3. Call `leave` to stop the task.
4. Call `update` to change the task configuration (optional).

#### Refactor the request body format

You must refactor the request body format from version 5.x v1. The main mapping relationships are as follows:

1. Map `audio.agoraRtcConfig.channelName` to `rtcConfig.channelName`.
2. Map `audio.agoraRtcConfig.maxIdleTime` to `maxIdleTime`.
3. Map `config.recognizeConfig.language` to the `languages` array.
4. Map `audio.agoraRtcConfig.uid` and `token` to `rtcConfig.subBotUid` and `subBotToken`.
5. Set `rtcConfig.pubBotUid` and `pubBotToken` if needed.
6. If storage is required, map the storage configuration to `captionConfig.storage`.

#### Update the URL and authentication method

1. Remove all calls to `acquire` and the `builderToken` processing logic.
2. Update the API path from `/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/` to `/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/`.
3. Update the task identifier from `taskId` to `agent_id`.
4. Change in HTTP methods. Note that the request for stopping a task now uses `POST` instead of `DELETE`. 

### Migrate from 5.x v2 to 7.x

Since the structure of version 5.x v2 is similar to that of version 7.x, the migration process is more straightforward.

#### Update the API call process

**Version 5.x v2**

1. Call `acquire` to get a `builderToken`.
2. Use the `builderToken` to call `start` and start the task.
3. Use `query` to check the task status.
4. Use `stop` to stop the task.
5. Use `update` to update the task configuration (optional).

**Version 7.x**

1. Call `join` to start the task and get the `agent_id`.
2. Call `get` to check the task status.
3. Call `leave` to stop the task.
4. Call `update` to change the task configuration (optional).

#### Update the request body format

The request body format of version 5.x v2 is similar to that of version 7.x. Make the following changes:

- Add the `name` parameter (required) in the `join` request.
- If needed, add the `uidLanguagesConfig` parameter to support personalized language settings.

#### Update the URL and authentication method

- Remove all calls to `acquire` and related `builderToken` handling logic.
- Update the API path from `/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/` to `/api/speech-to-text/v1/projects/{appid}/`.
- Update method names in the path as follows:
    - `start` → `join`
    - `query` → `get` 
    - `stop` → `leave`
- Change the task identifier from `taskId` to `agent_id`.
- Update the HTTP methods. Note that `stop` is now a `POST` request instead of `DELETE`.

## FAQs

#### Why should I migrate from version 5.x to 7.x?
Version 7.x delivers a more reliable and robust service, simplifies the API process, and adds new features such as support for language identification at the UID level. It significantly improves both stability and scalability.

#### What are the main differences between version 5.x v1 and 5.x v2?
Version 5.x v2 introduced a more streamlined structure compared to v1 and is closer to the 7.x design. It supports additional features, such as subtitle translation, and adopts a flatter request structure that is easier to maintain.

#### Do I need to keep both version 5.x and 7.x in my codebase?
No. Migrate fully to version 7.x. Older versions are deprecated and may not be maintained in the future.

#### What should I be aware of during the migration process?
If you're using version 5.x v1, pay close attention to the complete restructuring of the request body. For all users, make sure to update the API endpoints, remove the acquire-token flow, and note changes to HTTP methods. For example, the `stop` method has changed from `DELETE` to `POST`.

#### Does version 7.x support string type UIDs?
Currently, UIDs are still treated as integers internally, although they are passed as strings in the API. This prepares for future support of true string UIDs. Version 7.x automatically converts string UIDs to integers for compatibility.

#### Have error codes changed in version 7.x?
Yes. Version 7.x includes standardized error codes for more consistent handling.

#### How can I verify that the new API works correctly after migration?
Follow these steps to validate the functionality after migration:
- Start a task and obtain the `agent_id`
- Query the task status to confirm it is running
- Perform speech recognition tests and review the output
- Test stopping the task and updating its configuration

#### How can I ensure a smooth migration?
Use the following approach to ensure smooth migration:
- Complete migration and testing in a staging environment
- Prepare a fallback plan and keep the old version temporarily
- Use a phased rollout, starting with non-critical services
- Monitor the new API’s performance and error rate before full deployment

## Migration troubleshooting
If you encounter problems during the migration process, refer to the following table:

| Error description             | Possible cause    | Recommended action        |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Authentication failed        | Missing or incorrect authentication header             | Check if the auth configuration is correct and if the app ID is enabled on the new service |
| Task cannot be started       | Incorrect request parameter format  | Verify the parameter format against the documentation; ensure `languages` is an array |
| Task status cannot be queried| Incorrect `agent_id` or the task has already ended     | Use the correct `agent_id` returned by the `join` interface      |
| Audio subscription problem   | Subscription config doesn't match UID in the channel   | Check that `subscribeAudioUids` matches actual UIDs in the channel                 |
| Recognition result problem   | Incorrect language configuration    | Ensure the `languages` array includes a valid language code, such as `["zh-CN"]`    |
