## Project setup

To create a <Vpd  k="SDK" /> development environment:

<Setup />

## Implement <Vg k="MESS" />

Best practice is to separate the <Vg k="MESS" /> workflows from your UI implementation. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> sample
project implements the <Vg k="MESS" />  business logic in the `SignalingManager` object. This class encapsulates the
`signalingEngine`, an instance of the`AgoraRTM`, and core functionality such as logging in To <Vg k="MESS"
/>, sending a message, listening for messages from other users and logging out.

The following code examples show how to implement these steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<Implement />


## Test this <Vg k="MESS" /> implementation

This section explains how to run the sample project and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:

- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).

- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.

- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your server.

- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for channel messaging.
