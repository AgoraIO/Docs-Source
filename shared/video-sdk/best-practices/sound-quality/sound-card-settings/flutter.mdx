### Disable `3A`

<Vg k="VSDK" /> turns on `3A` by default. `3A` stands for echo cancellation (AEC), noise reduction (ANS), and gain control (AGC) in audio processing. Sound card devices usually provide some built-in audio processing, such as echo and noise cancellation. Currently, if `3A` is enabled in the application layer, it may cause over-processing of the audio signal, and interference between different algorithms may impact sound quality. Therefore, it is recommended that users using sound cards call [`setParameters`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/flutter/6.x/API/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setparameters) to disable the `3A` function enabled by default.

```dart
Future<void> setParameters(String parameters);
```

### Turn on stereo capture

Call [`setAdvancedAudioOptions`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/flutter/6.x/API/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setadvancedaudiooptions) to set the number of audio pre-processing channels to `AGORA_AUDIO_STEREO_PROCESSING` (2), that is, use two channels to collect and send stereo sound.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note"> 
Call this method before calling `joinChannel`, `enableAudio`, and `enableLocalAudio.

```dart
Future<void> setAdvancedAudioOptions(AdvancedAudioOptions options);
```
