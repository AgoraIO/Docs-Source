This page shows how to start Broadcast Streaming using the default Agora domain. With a simple API call, you get everything you need to push a live stream and play it back.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

-   [Enable Broadcast Streaming](enable-broadcast-streaming) in Agora Console.
-   Install streaming software such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) or [XSplit Broadcaster](https://www.xsplit.com/broadcaster).

## Project setup

### Get an App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637824227532" />  icon in the App ID column.

### Get a Customer ID and Customer Secret

Broadcast Streaming servers use a Customer ID/Customer Secret pair for authentication.

To generate a set of Customer ID and Customer Secret, do the following:

1. In [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), click the account name in the top right corner, and click **RESTful API** from the drop-down list to enter the **RESTful API** page.
   ![1637661003647](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637661003647)
2. Click **Add a secret**, and click **OK**. A set of Customer ID and Customer Secret is generated.
3. Click **Download** in the **Customer Secret** column. Read the pop-up window carefully, and save the downloaded `key_and_secret.txt` file in a secure location.


<div class="alert info">This quickstart uses the <code>curl -u</code> command to generate the <code>Authorization</code> parameter in the HTTP request header. Alternatively, you can use the sample code for other programming languages in [Pass the basic HTTP authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).</div>

## Implement Broadcast Streaming

### Step 1: Create a live stream <a name="create"></a>

To create a live stream, send a request to the Broadcast Streaming endpoint:

1. Copy the following code into your command-line tool:

    ```text
    appid=<Your_App_ID>
    key=<Your_Customer_ID>
    secret=<Your_Customer_Secret>

    curl  https://api.agora.io/${region}/v1/projects/${appid}/cfls/live-streams \
        -u "${key}:${secret}" \
        -X POST
    ```

2. Replace `<Your_App_ID>`, `<Your_Customer_ID>`, and `<Your_Customer_Secret>` with your values from Agora Console.

3. Replace `${region}` with the value for your business region:

    - `na`: North America.
    - `ap`: Southeast Asia.
    - `eu`: Europe.

If the request is successful, the response includes a Stream Key and a Playback ID, which are used in subsequent steps:

-  Stream Key: A secret used to configure streaming software.
-  Playback ID: A string used to create the playback URL.

<div class="alert note">The Broadcast Streaming servers automatically delete all the information about a live stream if the Stream Key or Playback ID is inactive for 30 days.</div>

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": "v2xxxxxxO5",
        // Your Stream Key
        "streamKey": "M3xxxxxxWb",
        "playbackIds": [
            {
                // Your Playback ID
                "id": "vgxxxxxxQy",
                "policy": "public"
            }
        ],
        "transcodings": {
            "id": "default",
            "standardTemps": [
                "fhd",
                "sd1",
                "ld"
            ],
            "createdAt": "1640995200"
        },
        "createdAt": "1650017833"
    }
}
```

The detailed description of the response body fields is as follows:
- `status`: Whether the request is successful. Possible values include:
  - `"success"`: The request is successful. Detailed information is returned in `data`.
  - `"fail"`: The request failed because of invalid arguments.
  - `"error"`: The request failed because of a server error.
- `data`: A JSON Object which contains the following fields:
  - `id`: The unique identifier of the stream.
  - `streamKey`: The Stream Key, a secret used to configure streaming software.
  - `playbackIds`: A JSON Array of Playback ID objects. Each Playback ID object contains the following fields:
    - `id`: The Playback ID, a string used to create the playback URL.
    - `policy`: The playback policy. Possible values include:
      - `"public"`: The Playback ID alone can be used to play the live stream.
      - `"private"`: The Playback ID must be used with a JSON Web Token (JWT) to play the live stream.
  - `transcodings`: A JSON Object which contains the following fields:
    - `id`: The unique identifier of the transcoding configuration. `"default"` stands for the default configuration.
    - `standardTemps`: A JSON Array of the standard transcoding templates you want to use. For details about standard transcoding templates, see [Transcoding Configuration API Reference](../restful-api/transcoding/standard#http-request).
    - `createdAt`: The time (Unix timestamp) when the transcoding configuration is created.
  - `createdAt`: The time (Unix timestamp) when the live stream is created.

### Step 2: Push the live stream

Broadcast Streaming supports pushing streams using the RTMP or RTMPS protocol. To push an RTMP or RTMPS stream, you need to configure streaming software. The following example uses OBS:

1. Open OBS, and click the **Settings** button in the widget list in the bottom right corner. ![open obs setting](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637724707399)

2. Click **Stream** in the left navigation menu in the Settings window, and choose **Custom...** in Service.
3. Fill in the Server and Stream key:
    - Server: `rtmps://stream-in.agoramdn.com/live`
    - Stream key: The `streamKey` that is returned when you [create a live stream](#create).
      ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649670946752)
4. Click **OK** to save the settings.

### Step 3: Play the live stream

To play the live stream, create an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playback URL using the Playback ID returned when you [create the live stream](#create):

```text
https://stream.agoramdn.com/${playbackId}.m3u8
```

For each live stream to be played, Broadcast Streaming automatically transcodes the stream into three resolutions. The URLs of these three stream versions are provided in the [Master Playlist](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.4):

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:6
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2150400,CODECS=mp4a.40.2,avc1.640020,RESOLUTION=1920x1080
https://global.manifest.a2.agoramdn.com/S3hLV2o3bUFrYWhwaUpmbWFLWmVaWmtkcVZ1WlB4TUhhQ3NSOmZoZA/rendition.m3u8?token=NjIzNDM2M2ZfYjA2NzEyZWJjMWMxNmEzNjA2NGVkNTcyMmQzYjE4ZTExZDE3YmU3NDM4YzYyNjc4NzU1MjE5MDk0NWJhMmUzYQ%3D%3D
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=655360,CODECS=mp4a.40.2,avc1.640020,RESOLUTION=640x360
https://global.manifest.a2.agoramdn.com/S3hLV2o3bUFrYWhwaUpmbWFLWmVaWmtkcVZ1WlB4TUhhQ3NSOnNkMQ/rendition.m3u8?token=NjIzNDM2M2ZfZWVlMzZjNGU0MjdiMDgzYTEwZGFjYWFlMGY0YmNhMjk4YzkxODllYTBhOGI3NjJjOWMzNmVkMmE1N2Q5MmMxYw%3D%3D
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=409600,CODECS=mp4a.40.2,avc1.640020,RESOLUTION=360x240
https://global.manifest.a2.agoramdn.com/S3hLV2o3bUFrYWhwaUpmbWFLWmVaWmtkcVZ1WlB4TUhhQ3NSOmxk/rendition.m3u8?token=NjIzNDM2M2ZfNDc4ZDRlYzk2MzkzMDBkYTA3MDE5NjRlMTg0NmYxMzdjNWI2MGJlNzJlMzA3MmU0MzRlNWU5MDM3MTYzYzM5Yw%3D%3D
```

If you want to access the original stream (which is not transcoded), use the following playback URL instead:

```text
https://stream.agoramdn.com/${playbackId}_original.m3u8
```

### Step 4: Stop streaming

Stop the streaming software to disconnect from the Broadcast Streaming servers.

## Next steps

After implementing Broadcast Streaming, you can try the following functions.

### Use transcoding templates

1. Get a `transcodingsId` by sending the following request:

    ```shell
    appid=<Your_App_ID>
    key=<Your_Customer_ID>
    secret=<Your_Customer_Secret>

    curl  https://api.agora.io/${region}/v1/projects/${appid}/cfls/live-transcodings\
    -u "${key}:${secret}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
        "settings": {
            "standardTemps": [
                # Specify transcoding templates here
                "hd",
                "sd1",
                "ld"
            ]
        }
    }'
    ```

    1. Replace `<Your_App_ID>`, `<Your_Customer_ID>`, `<Your_Customer_Secret>`, and `${region}` with your values.
    2. Specify the transcoding templates you want to use in `standardTemps`. For details about the supported templates, see [Transcoding Configuration API Reference](../restful-api/transcoding/standard#http-request).

    If the request is successful, the response looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            // Your transcodingsId
            "id": "zFxxxxxxmk",
            "standardTemps": [
                "hd",
                "sd1",
                "ld"
            ],
            "createdAt": "1650018546"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Pass in the `transcodingsId` when creating a live stream:

    ```text
    curl  https://api.agora.io/${region}/v1/projects/${appid}/cfls/live-streams \
        -u "${key}:${secret}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
            "settings":{
                "transcodingsId": "zFxxxxxxmk"
            }
        }'
    ```

3. When playing the live stream, Broadcast Streaming automatically transcodes the stream using the specified templates. You can find the corresponding URLs in the Master Playlist.
