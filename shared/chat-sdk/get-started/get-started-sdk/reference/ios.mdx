## Other approaches to integrate the SDK

#### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Install CocoaPods if you have not. For details, see [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In the Terminal, navigate to the project root directory and run the `pod init` command to create a text file `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile` file and add the Agora Chat SDK. Remember to replace `AgoraChatExample` with the target name of your project.

   ```
   platform :ios, '11.0'

   target 'Your project target' do
       pod 'Agora_Chat_iOS'
   end
   ```

4. In the project root directory, run the following command to integrate the SDK. When the SDK is installed successfully, you can see `Pod installation complete!` in the Terminal and an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

   ```
   pod install
   ```

5. Open the `xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

#### Method 2: Through your local storage

1. Download the latest Agora Chat SDK and decompress it.

2. Copy `AgoraChat.framework` in the SDK package to the project folder. `AgoraChat.framework` contains arm64, armv7, and x86_64 instruction sets.

3. Open Xcode and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

4. Click **+ > Add Otherâ€¦ > Add Files** to add `AgoraChat.framework` and set the **Embed** property to **Embed & Sign**. Then the project automatically links to the required system library.
