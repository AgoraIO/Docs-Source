<PlatformWrapper platform="[android,ios,macos]">
A user channel in <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> allows for direct, point-to-point communication between individual users. This is often used in scenarios such as private chats, customer support interactions, or one-on-one communication.

This page shows you how to use the user channel to send messages to other users in the channel.

## Understand the Tech

To implement a user channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>:

1. **Set Up SDK**: Initialize an instance of the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> in your app.
2. **User Authentication**: Log in to the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> server using a unique user ID.
3. **Send Messages**: Use the `publish` method with the recipient's user ID to send messages.
4. **Handle Incoming Messages**: Listen for events to manage messages received directly by the user.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

* Integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project, and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.

## Implement communication in a user channel

This section shows you how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement user channel communication in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<ProjectImplement/>

<Vg k="SIG"/> currently supports only string and binary message data formats. If your business requires other data types such as JSON, Object, or third-party data construction tools like protobuf, you need to serialize the message data before sending it. For more information on how to effectively construct the payload data structure and recommended serialization methods, please refer to [Message Payload Structuring](../best-practices/message-payload-structuring).
