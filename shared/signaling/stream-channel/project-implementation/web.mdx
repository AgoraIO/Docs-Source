### Create a stream channel

To use stream channel functionality, call `createStreamChannel` to create a `RTMStreamChannel` object instance. 

```javascript
const channelName = "chat_room";
const streamChannel = rtmClient.createStreamChannel(channelName);
```

This method creates only one `RTMStreamChannel` instance at a time. If you need to create multiple instances, call the method multiple times.

```javascript
// Create the first instance
const streamChannel = rtmClient.createStreamChannel("chat_room_1");
// Create the second instance
const streamChannel = rtmClient.createStreamChannel("chat_room_2");
```

<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> enables you to create unlimited stream channel instances in a single <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. However, best practice is to create channels based on your actual requirements to maintain optimal client-side performance. For instance, if you hold multiple stream channel instances, destroy the ones that are no longer in use to prevent resource blocking, and recreate them when they are needed again.

### Join a stream channel

Call the `join` method on the `RTMStreamChannel` instance with appropriate options as follows:

```javascript
const options = {
  token: "your_token",
  withPresence: true,
  withLock: true,
  withMetadata: true
};
try {
  const result = await streamChannel.join(options);
} catch (status) {
  const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
  console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode: ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`);
}
```

When joining a channel, set the `token` parameter in `JoinChannelOptions` with a temporary token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

To facilitate testing of the app during development, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the project, and use the app ID in the `token` parameter when joining a channel.

```js
const options = {
    token: "your_appId",
    withPresence: true,
    withLock: true,
    withMetadata: true
};
try {
    const result = await streamChannel.join(options);
} catch (status) {
    const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
    console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode: ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`);
}
```

In stream channels, message flow is managed using topics. Even if you configure a global message listener, you must still join a topic to send messages. Similarly, to receive messages you must subscribe to a topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics) for more information.

### Send a message 

To send a message to a stream channel, you first need to:

- Create a `RTMStreamChannel` instance.
- Use the `join` method to join a channel.
- Call `joinTopic` to register as a message publisher for the specified topic. See [Topics](../core-functionality/topics).

Call `publishTopicMessage` to publish a message to a topic. This method sends a message to a single topic at a time. To deliver messages to multiple topics, call the method separately for each topic.

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```javascript
    // Sending a string message
    const payload = "Hello Agora!"; // Message content
    const topicName = "chat_topic"; // Topic to which the message is sent
    const options = { customType: "PainTxt" }; // Options for sending the message
    try {
      const result = await streamChannel.publishTopicMessage(topicName, payload, options); // Sending the message asynchronously
    } catch (status) {
      const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
      console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode: ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`); // Logging error information if message sending fails
    }
    ```

* Binary message

    ```javascript
    // Sending a binary message
    const message = "Hello Agora!"; // Binary message content
    const payload = new TextEncoder().encode(message); // Encoding message to binary data
    const topicName = "chat_topic"; // Topic to which the message is sent
    const options = { customType: "ByteArray" }; // Options for sending the message
    try {
      const result = await streamChannel.publishTopicMessage(topicName, payload, options); // Sending the message asynchronously
    } catch (status) {
      const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
      console.log(`${operation} failed, the error code is ${errorCode}, because of: ${reason}.`); // Logging error information if message sending fails
    }
    ```

In <Vg k="SIG" />, a user may register as a message publisher for up to 8 topics concurrently. However, there are no limitations on the number of users a single topic can accommodate. You can achieve a message transmission frequency to a topic of up to 120 QPS. This capability is useful in scenarios that demand high-frequency and high-concurrency data processing, such as Metaverse location status synchronization, collaborative office sketchpad applications, and parallel control operation-instructions transmission.

### Leave a stream channel

To leave a channel, call the `leave` method on the `RTMStreamChannel` instance:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await streamChannel.leave();
} catch (status) {
  const { operation, reason, errorCode } = status;
  console.log(`${operation} failed, ErrorCode ${errorCode}, due to: ${reason}.`);
}
```

To rejoin a stream channel, call the `join` method again. You can join and leave as long as the corresponding `RTMStreamChannel` instance remains active and has not been destroyed.
