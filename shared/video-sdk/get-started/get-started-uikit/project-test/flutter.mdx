6. Now, you can see yourself on the test device as you have successfully joined the channel as a **Host**.

8.  To join the channel as **Audience**, edit the `initAgora` method and add the following code after `client.initialize();`:

    ``` dart
    client.engine.enableLocalVideo(false);
    client.engine.enableLocalAudio(false);
    AgoraChannelData agoraChannelData = AgoraChannelData(
        clientRole: ClientRole.Audience,
    );
    client.sessionController.setChannelProperties(agoraChannelData);
    ```

9.  Relaunch the app. Now you have joined the channel as **Audience** and you see only the remote stream.
