### Development considerations

The `enableDualStream` method is not applicable for audio-only call scenarios.

There are several limitations to consider when sending large and small streams on mobile devices:

- It is not possible to send large and small streams using `h264` encoding on Android Chrome.
- When sending a small stream on iOS Safari and setting video properties using `setLowStreamParameter`, the `bitrate` setting is not supported, and the small stream resolution needs to be proportional to the large stream resolution.
- Some browsers are not fully adapted to dual-stream mode when using the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method. Known adaptation issues include:
  - macOS Safari: The frame rate and resolution of large and small streams are consistent.
  - iOS Safari 11: Large and small stream switching is not supported.
  - Firefox: The frame rate of small streams is fixed at 30 fps.
