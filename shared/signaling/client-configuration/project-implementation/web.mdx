### Geographical area configuration

To specify a geographical area for Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ connections, refer to the following code:

```js
// Set whitelist and blacklist areas
AgoraRTM.setArea({ areaCodes: ["CHINA", "INDIA"], excludedArea: "JAPAN" });
```

### Proxy configuration

In some environments with restricted network services, you may need to set up a proxy service to access external resources. <Vg k="SIG" /> supports configuring a proxy service. You enable this feature during the the <Vg k="SIG" /> instance initialization.

```javascript
const { RTM } = AgoraRTM;
const appId = "your_appId";
const userId = "your_userId";
const rtmConfig = { cloudProxy: true };
const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig);
```

### Log configuration

In the development and testing phase of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you may need to output more detailed information to locate and fix problems. Enable log output of the SDK and set the log information level by configuring `logLevel` when initializing the <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance. You can view the log information in the browser console.


```javascript
const { RTM } = AgoraRTM;
const appId = "your_appId";
const userId = "your_userId";
const rtmConfig = { logLevel : "debug" };
const rtm = new RTM(appId, userId, rtmConfig);
```

Choose the log level from the following: 

| Enumeration Value       | Description      |
|------------|-------|
| `debug`    | `0x0000`: Do not output any logs.      |
| `info`    | `0x0001`: Output logs at levels `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, and `info`. We recommend setting the log level to this level. |
| `warn`    | `0x0002`: Only output logs at levels `fatal`, `error`, and `warn`.         |
| `error`   | `0x0004`: Only output logs at levels `fatal` and `error`.      |
| `fatal`   | `0x0008`: Only output logs at the `fatal` level.   |

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
When your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is released to production, set the log level to `info`.
