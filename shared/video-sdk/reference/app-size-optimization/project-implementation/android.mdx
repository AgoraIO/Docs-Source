#### Integration through Maven Central

When integrating the Android SDK through Maven Central, you can modify the `dependencies` in the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file to specify the dynamic libraries you need to integrate, and exclude the plugins you don't need. For the relationship between each file in the Android SDK and the gradle `dependencies`, see [dependency implementation](#dependency-implementation). 

Refer to the following examples to include all plugins, exclude all plugins, or to include only the specified plugins.

* If you need to use all plugins, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:4.0.1'
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-screen-sharing:4.0.1'
        ...
    }
    ```

* If you do not need to use any plugin, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:4.0.1'
        ...
    }
    ```

* If you only need to use specific plugins such as the AI ​​noise reduction plugin and Bel Canto plugin, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

    ```
    dependencies {
        def agora_sdk_version = "4.0.1"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:${agora_sdk_version}"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-ains:${agora_sdk_version}"
        implementation "io.agora.rtc:audio-beauty:${agora_sdk_version}"
        ...
    }
    ```
