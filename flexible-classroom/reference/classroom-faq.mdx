## General product inquiry

### What classroom states does Flexible Classroom support?

Flexible Classroom supports three classroom states: not started, started, and ended. Refer to the following table for a detailed description of each state:

| Classroom state | Description|
|:----|:-----------|
| Not started  Started | When the classroom state is not started or started, both teachers and students can do the following:<ul><li>Engage in real-time audio and video interaction.</li><li>Send real-time messages.</li><li>See the list of students.</li><li>Use the whiteboard for writing or file sharing.</li></ul>Flexible Classroom cloud service marks the current state. |
| Ended |<ul><li>Teachers and students are immediately disconnected from the classroom.</li><li>Real-time audio and video interaction, real-time messaging, and whiteboard functions are all disabled.</li><li>Neither teachers nor students can join a classroom in an ended state.</li><li>An ended classroom cannot be restarted.</li><li>A classroom is destroyed automatically one hour after it is ended.</li></ul>|

#### Change the classroom state

In the Flexible Classroom client, you can specify the starting time and duration of a classroom by calling launch to set the following parameters:

* `startTime`: The starting time of the class in Unix format (ms), subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who joins the classroom.
* `duration`: The duration (s) of the class, subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who joins the classroom.

The state of the classroom is automatically started at the specified start time and automatically ended after the specified duration elapses.

In addition, you can change the classroom state by calling the RESTful API.


## Integration issues

### How to connect Flexible Classroom with your own user management system and class scheduling system?

Flexible Classroom enables real-time engagement in classrooms but does not provide user management system and class scheduling system. If you already have a user management system and class scheduling system, refer to the following picture to connect Flexible Classroom with your own systems.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1625827386244)

You need to implement the following business logic:

* Deploy an RTM Token generator on your server, and generate an RTM Token with parameters including the Agora App ID, App Certificate, and user ID. For details, see Generate an RTM Token.

* Design a RESTful API for the following three purposes:
    * Check whether the user logging into the app exists in your user management system.
    * Get the user's personal information and class schedule.
    * Get the RTM token generated by the RTM Token Generator.

After the client gets the user ID, class ID, and RTM token, refer to the quickstart guide to call the launch method in the Agora Classroom SDK and pass in the user ID, class ID, and RTM token to the SDK to join a flexible classroom.

|:warning:**Caution**|
|:---|
| <ul><li>Please ensure that the user ID and class ID are globally unique.</li><li>When the first user joins the classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom. The classroom is destroyed one hour after the last user leaves the classroom. Agora does not store any of your business data.</li></ul>|

### How can I set user properties and classroom properties?

Flexible Classroom supports custom user properties and classroom properties. The property consists of a property name and a property value. Each property name has only one property value.

You can modify the value of a custom user or classroom property through full modification or path modification:

Suppose the current custom user or classroom property is as follows:

```json
{"key1":
   {"subkey1":"a",
    "subkey2":"b"
   },
 "key2":
   {"subkey3":"c",
    "subkey4":"d"
   }
}
```

There are several scenarios:

* If you want to capitalize all values of `subkey`, you can pass the following JSON array when calling the API through full modification:

    ```json
    {"key1":
        {"subkey1":"A",
        "subkey2":"B"
        },
    "key2":
        {"subkey3":"C",
        "subkey4":"D"
        }
    }
    ```

* If you only want to capitalize the value in `subkey1`, changing `a` into `A`, for example, you can pass `{"key1.subkey1":"A"}` when calling the API through path modification.

* If you want to add `subkey5` with the value of `E` to `key1`, you can pass `{"key1.subkey5":"E"}` when calling the API. The properties after modification are:

    ```json
    {"key1":
        {"subkey1":"A",
        "subkey2":"B",
        "subkey5":"E"
        },
    "key2":
        {"subkey3":"C",
        "subkey4":"D"
        }
    }
    ```

    Please note that if you pass `{"key1": {"subkey5": "E"} }`, all the original properties are overwritten.

* You can add multiple properties once. For example, pass `{"key1.subkey5":"E", "key2.subkey6":"F"}`. The properties after modification are:

    ```json
    {"key1":
        {"subkey1":"A",
        "subkey2":"B",
        "subkey5":"E"
        },
    "key2":
        {"subkey3":"C",
        "subkey4":"D",
        "subkey6":"F"
        }
    }    
    ```
