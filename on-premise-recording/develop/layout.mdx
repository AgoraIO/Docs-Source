This guide shows you how to configure the video layout during composite recording using the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

In composite recording mode, the SDK renders the final video on a canvas that includes multiple user video streams. Each stream is placed in a defined region of the canvas. The canvas acts as the background, and you specify the dimensions and position of each userâ€™s video.

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
The aspect ratio of a user's video must match that of the assigned region. If the aspect ratios differ, the SDK crops the video, which can result in image loss.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before using layouts, complete the steps in the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/quickstart) guide to integrate the SDK and set up basic recording.
