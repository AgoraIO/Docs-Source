When the connection status changes, <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends a `connectionChangedToState` callback. This section describes how to use the `connectionChangedToState` callback to monitor changes in a channel's connection state.

In your project, open the file with `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` and copy the following code into the `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` initialization process:

``` swift
func rtcEngine(_ engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit, connectionChangedTo state: AgoraConnectionState, reason: AgoraConnectionChangedReason) {
    LogUtils.log(message: "Connection state changed: \(state) \(reason)", level: .info)
}
```

The code logs the connection state changes and the reason for the state change.
The `reason` parameter in `connectionChangedToState` explains why the connection state changed and helps you troubleshoot your network.
