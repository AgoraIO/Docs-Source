Language configuration in <Vpd k="NAME" /> involves two key components:

- **Input language**: The language for speech recognition (STT)
- **Output language**: The language for speech synthesis (TTS)

This guide shows you how to configure both components for different agent types.

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

- Complete the [Agent quickstart](../get-started/quickstart)
- Verify the playground is running at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## STT language configuration

### Standard STT agents

For agents using separate STT modules:

1. Open the playground at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

2. Select the `voice_assistant` graph type

3. Click the settings button next to the graph selector

4. Choose **STT** from the extension dropdown

5. Update the language property to your target language

6. Click **Save Changes**

### RTC Integrated Azure STT agents

For agents with RTC-integrated Azure STT:

1. Open the playground at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

2. Select the `voice_assistant_integrated_stt` graph type

3. Click the settings button next to the graph selector

4. Choose **RTC** from the extension dropdown

5. Update the language property (for example, use `en-US` for English)

6. Click **Save Changes**

## TTS language configuration

TTS language support depends on the selected voice. Some voices support multiple languages, while others support only one.

To configure TTS language:

1. Open the playground at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

2. Select the `voice_assistant` graph type

3. Click the settings button next to the graph selector

4. Choose the TTS from the extension dropdown

5. Select a voice that supports your target language

6. Click **Save Changes**
