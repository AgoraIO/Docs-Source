## Classroom Services Billing Policy

Smart Classroom's classroom services are calculated based on the usage and unit price of the classroom service . The formula is usage × unit price .

### Smart Classroom Service Usage

Smart Classroom calculates the time usage based on the number of people in the room, that is, the time usage of each Smart Classroom room is the sum of the time generated by all users in the room .

For each user, Agora starts timing when he joins the smart classroom room and ends when he leaves the room. Dosage accuracy is minutes .

Depending on whether the user subscribes to the video stream in the smart classroom room, the duration usage can be divided into the following two categories:

- Audio duration usage: If the user does not subscribe to the video stream, audio usage will be incurred regardless of whether the user subscribes to the audio stream.
- Video duration usage: If the user successfully subscribes to the video stream, video usage is generated. If you subscribe to both audio and video streams, only the video usage is counted.

### Smart classroom classroom service unit price

Smart Classroom divides the video levels into four levels: HD, FHD, 2K and 2K+ based on the collective resolution of all video streams subscribed by the user, and calculates the cost of each level of video respectively. Unit price details are shown in the table below:

| Subscription type/video slot | Collection resolution of user subscribed videos | Smart classroom interactive live broadcast1(yuan/thousand minutes) | Smart Classroom Extremely Fast Live Broadcast1(yuan/thousand minutes) |  
|---|---|---|---|
| Audio | / | 19 | 16 |  
| High Definition Video (HD) | Collection resolution ≤ 921,600 (1280 × 720) | 42 | 27 |  
| Full High Definition Video (FHD) | 921,600 (1280 × 720) < set resolution ≤ 2,073,600 (1920 × 1080) | 81 | 47 |  
| 2K video | 2,073,600 (1920 × 1080) < Collection resolution ≤ 3,686,400 (2560 × 1440) | 135 | 73 |  
| 2K+ video | 3,686,400 (2560 × 1440) < Set resolution ≤ 8,847,360 (4096 × 2160) | 289 | 150 |

## Billing example

This section shows how to count the usage of Smart Classroom under an Shengwang developer account and calculate the total cost based on the corresponding unit price.

### Scene description

Assume that 1 teacher, 5 students, and 3 parents join a smart classroom room at the same time, and conduct a 60-minute interactive live video course. In the course:

- The teacher and 5 students interacted via video over the mic. The video resolution of the teacher and students was 360 × 240.
- 3 parents subscribed to teacher and all student video streams
- In addition, the teacher also shared his screen with all students and parents in the room. The resolution of both the sent and received screen sharing streams is 1280 × 720.

  | user | Subscribed video streams | Collection resolution of videos | Subscribe to video streaming slots |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | teacher | 5 students | 360 × 240 × 5 = 432,000 | High Definition Video (HD) |
  | student | Teacher + shared screen by teacher + 4 other students | 360 × 240 + 1280 x 720 + 360 × 240 × 4 = 1,353,600 | Full HD video |
  | parents | Teacher + shared screen by teacher + 5 students | 360 × 240 + 1280 x 720 + 360 × 240 × 5 = 1,440,000 | Full HD video |

### Cost calculation

The calculation results of the videos at each level and the total cost are as shown in the table below:

| Paid service (subscription for video streaming slots) | Total time usage (minutes) = sum of time usage of each user | Unit price (yuan/thousand minutes) | Each service fee (yuan) | Total cost (yuan) (rounded to two decimal places) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High Definition Video (HD) | 60 | 42 | (60/1000) × 42 = 2.52 | 41.4 |
| Full HD video | 60 × 8 = 480 | 81 | (480/1000) × 81 = 38.88 |  |

## Tiered discount

When your total monthly usage exceeds 100,000 minutes, Shengwang also automatically provides tiered discounts:

| Dosage (minutes) | Discount |
|---|---|
| 100,000 to 499,999 | 5% |
| 500,000 to 999,999 | 7% |
| 1,000,000 and above | 10% |

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">The discounts for each tier are only applicable to the usage within the corresponding tier range. For example, if the usage is 600,000 minutes, there will be no discount for 1 to 99,999 minutes, a 5% discount for 100,000 to 499,999 minutes, and a 7% discount for 500,000 to 999,999 minutes. </Admonition>
