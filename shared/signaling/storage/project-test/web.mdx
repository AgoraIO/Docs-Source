1. In `<samples-root>/signaling-sdk-samples-web/src/signaling_manager/config.json`, update the following parameter values:

    * `appId`: Your <Vpd k="NAME" /> enabled app ID from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

    * `serverUrl`: The URL of your token server. See [Create and run a token server](../get-started/authentication-workflow#create-and-run-a-token-server) to set one up.


1. To access the token server from the web app, you use a proxy server. To start the proxy service, run the following command in Terminal from the `<samples-root>/signaling-sdk-samples-web/src` folder:

    ```bash
    node proxy
    ```

1. To build and run the project, open a Terminal in the `<samples-root>/signaling-sdk-samples-web` folder, and run the following commands:

    ``` bash
    npm run build
    npm run start:dev
    ```

1. In your browser, open `http://localhost:9000/` and select the **Store channel and user data** project from the navigation bar.

1. Enter a numeric **User ID** and press **Login** to log in to <Vg k="MESS" />.

1. Enter a **Channel name** and press **Subscribe** to subscribe to a channel. You see the following:

    1. Your User ID appears in the **Users in the channel** list.
    1. Under **Channel Metadata**, you see the `lastUser` key that is saved to the channel.
    1. In the log events section at the bottom, you see notifications confirming update of channel and user metadata.  

1. In another browser tab, load `http://localhost:9000/storage` and log in using a different **User ID**. Enter the same channel name as before, and press **Subscribe**. You see the following:

    1. Both User IDs appear in the user lists in both tabs.
    1. The value of the `lastUser` key, under **Channel Metadata**, is updated in *both* tabs with the time of the latest login. The updated `AuthorUid` shows the User ID of the new user.

1. In either browser tab, type in some text in the **Save your bio to user metadata** box and press **Update Bio**. You see user metadata `UPDATE` notifications in both tabs.

1. In the other browser tab, select the user for which you modified the User bio under **Users in the channel**. You see their updated metadata displayed in the log events section.
