In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID. You create a token for each user in the channel. Each user must log in from a different instance of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
To test <Vg k="MESS" />, you run two or more instances of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. When you call `login` using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same as you used to create the token.

For each user in your tests:

1. **Configure the project**

    <SetTokenConfig/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test the basic functionality**:

    1. Open a new instance of the reference app.
    1. Choose the **SDK quickstart** example.
    1. Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />. 
    1. Subscribe to a channel, then send and receive messages.
