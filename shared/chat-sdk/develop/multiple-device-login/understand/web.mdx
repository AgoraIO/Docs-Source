- Single-device login: The newly logged-in device will force the current device to log out. The logged-out device will receive the `onDisconnected` event.
- Multi-device login: If the number of logged-in devices on one end reaches the upper limit, the newly logged-in device will force the earliest logged-in device on that end to log out. Chat only supports forced logout for devices on the same end. The logged-out device will receive the `onDisconnected` event.
