The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> uses `IAgoraChatManager` to provide message receipt. Followings are the core methods:

- `AgoraChatOptions.enableRequireReadAck`: Enables message read receipt.
- `AgoraChatOptions.enableDeliveryAck`: Enables message delivery receipt.
- `ackConversationRead`: Sends a conversation read receipt.
- `sendMessageReadAck`: Sends a message read receipt.
- `sendGroupMessageReadAck`: Sends a message read receipt for group chat.

The logic for implementing these receipts are as follows:

- Message delivery receipts

  1. The message sender enables delivery receipts by setting `AgoraChatOptions.enableDeliveryAck` as `YES`.
  2. After the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically sends a delivery receipt to the sender.
  3. The sender receives the delivery receipt by listening for `messageDidDeliver`.

- Conversation and message read receipts

  1. The message sender enables read receipt by setting `AgoraChatOptions.enableRequireReadAck` as `YES`.
  2. After reading the message, the recipient calls `ackConversationRead` or `sendMesageReadAck` to send a conversation or message read receipt.
  3. The sender receives the conversation or message receipt by listening for `onConversationRead` or `messageDidRead`.
