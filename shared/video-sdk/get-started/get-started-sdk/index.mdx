<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> enables one-to-one or small-group video interactions with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>s.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> enables you to host live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video interaction into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s.
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> for applications where ultra-low latency (400-800ms) is needed to keep audiences engaged, such as talk shows, sports broadcasts and live auctions. For further information on setting the audience latency level in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, see the [Call quality](../develop/ensure-channel-quality) and [Pricing](../overview/pricing#unit-pricing) guides.

<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> enables you to host large-scale live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video interaction into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s.
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> for applications where low latency (1500-2000ms) is needed for limited audience engagement, such as podcasts, gaming streams and other virtual events. For further information on setting the audience latency level in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, see the [Call quality](../develop/ensure-channel-quality) and [Pricing](../overview/pricing#unit-pricing) guides.

Thanks to <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network ([<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />](../overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn)), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

This section explains how you can integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the basic workflow you need to integrate this feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">

In an <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> event, hosts stream a video feed to an audience. For example, when a CEO is giving a speech to the company employees, the CEO does not need to see all members of the audience. To represent this in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, when you join as a host, the local feed is started and you see your own video feed. When you join as a member of the audience, you see the host's video feed.
</ProductWrapper>


To start a session, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- *Set the channel profile and role.*
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
- *Set the latency level.*
</ProductWrapper>
- *Retrieve a token*: A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. In this guide you retrieve your token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To see how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

- *Join a channel*: Call methods to create and join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- *Host publishes local video and audio to the channel*: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. Each host can publish their local video to the channel.
- *Audience subscribes to video and audio published by the hosts to the channel*: Audience members view content published by hosts to the channel.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
- *Send and receive video and audio in the channel*: All users send and receive video and audio streams from all users in the channel.
</ProductWrapper>

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<PrerequisitesGetStarted />

## Project setup

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unreal, electron,  react-native">
To get up and running quickly with Agora's powerful communication capabilities, choose the option that best fits your needs:

### Install and run the reference app
The quickest way to experience the features of <Vpd k="SDK" /> is by installing and running the reference app. This app showcases key features and provides a solid foundation for your own implementations.
To install the <Vg k="VSDK" /> reference <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> on your development device:
<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to test <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features using the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app and view the associated code.

### Start your own project

To create a new <Vpl k="NAME" /> project with the necessary dependencies:
<NewProject />

You are ready to implement <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features in your <Vpl k="NAME" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="unreal, electron, react-native">
To integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:


<ProjectSetup />
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unreal">

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />

When a user opens the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" />. When the user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing <Vg k="COMPANY"/> features and not UX bells and whistles.

</PlatformWrapper>

<ProjectImplement />

## Test the implementation

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends you run this project on a physical mobile device, as some simulators may not support the full features of this project. To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProjectTest />

## Reference

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

<Reference />

- [Downloads](../reference/downloads) shows you how to install <Vpd k="SDK" /> manually.

- To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, best practice is to set up and use a token server to obtain an authentication tokens. See [Secure authentication with tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow).
