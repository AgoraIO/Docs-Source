Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Use the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/) to generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

    1. Select Signaling from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
    1. Fill in your app ID and app certificate from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
    1. Click **Generate Token**.

1. In `index.html`, replace `your_appid` and `your_token` values in the code with your project's app ID and the generated token.

1. Update the value for the `userId` with an integer value.

1. Save the file and run it in your browser. 

1. Make a copy of the project. Use the same `app_id` but a different `userId`. Launch another instance of the page in a separate browser tab. 

1. Type a message in the text input box in either instance and click the **Send** button. The message is displayed in the other app instance.

1. Swap the sending and receiving instances and send another message.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
