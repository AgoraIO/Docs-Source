This section shows you how to implement the following methods of multi-channel streaming:

-   [Channel media relay](#channel-media-relay)

-   [Join multiple channels](#implement-joining-multiple-channels)

Choose the method that best suits your scenario and follow the step by step procedure.

### Channel media relay

In this example, you use a single `Button` to start and stop channel media relay.

#### Implement the user interface

To enable your users to start and stop relaying to another channel, add a `Button` to the user interface. Open `/lib/main.dart` and add the following lines after `ListView(...children: [` in the `build` method:
``` dart
ElevatedButton(
    child: relayState == ChannelMediaRelayState.relayStateRunning
        ? const Text("Stop Channel media relay")
        : relayState == ChannelMediaRelayState.relayStateConnecting
            ? const Text("Channel media relay connecting ...")
            : const Text("Start media relay"),
    onPressed: () => {channelRelay()},
),
```

#### Implement channel media relay

To enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to relay channel media to a destination channel, take the following steps:

1.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To store source and destination channel settings and manage channel relay, in `/lib/main.dart`, add the following variable declarations to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    String destChannelName = "<name of the destination channel>";
    String destChannelToken = "<access token for the destination channel>";    
    int destUid = 0; // Uid to identify the relay stream in the destination channel
    String sourceChannelToken =  "<access token for the source channel>"; // Generate with the channelName and uid = 0.
    bool mediaRelaying = false;
    ChannelMediaRelayState relayState = ChannelMediaRelayState.relayStateIdle;
    ```

1.  **Start or stop channel media relay**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts relaying media from the source channel to the destination channel. If channel media relay is already running, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> stops it. To integrate this workflow, add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class.

    ``` dart
    void channelRelay() async {
        if (mediaRelaying) {
            agoraEngine.stopChannelMediaRelay();
        } else {
            // Define the channel media relay configuration
            ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration mediaRelayConfiguration =
                ChannelMediaRelayConfiguration(
                    srcInfo: ChannelMediaInfo(
                        channelName: channelName, // Default value is NULL, which means the SDK applies the name of the current channel
                        uid: 0, // You must set it as 0 which means the SDK generates a random uid
                        token: sourceChannelToken // token generated with the channelName and uid in srcInfo
                    ), //
                    destInfos: [
                        ChannelMediaInfo(
                            channelName: destChannelName, // The name of the destination channel
                            uid: destUid, // The Uid to identify the relay stream in the destination channel
                            token: destChannelToken // Token generated with the channelName and uid in destInfos
                        )
                    ],
                    destCount: 1);

            // Start relaying media streams across channels
            agoraEngine.startChannelMediaRelay(mediaRelayConfiguration);
        }
    }
    ```

1.  **Monitor the channel media relay state**

    To receive notification of connection state changes during channel media relay, you add an event handler. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> responds to connection and failure events in the `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged` event. In `setupVideoSDKEngine()`, add the following code after `RtcEngineEventHandler(`:

    ``` dart
    onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged: (ChannelMediaRelayState state, ChannelMediaRelayError error) {
        setState(() {
            relayState = state;
        });

        if (state == ChannelMediaRelayState.relayStateRunning) {
            mediaRelaying = true;
            showMessage("Channel media relay running.");
        } else {
            mediaRelaying = false;
            showMessage("Relay state:\n" + state.toString()) + "\n" + error.toString() ;
        }
    },
    ```

1.  **Monitor channel media relay events**

    To receive notifications of important channel relay events such as network disconnection, reconnection, and users joining channels, you add the `onChannelMediaRelayEvent` method to the event handler. In `setupVideoSDKEngine()`, add the following code after `RtcEngineEventHandler(`:

    ``` dart
    onChannelMediaRelayEvent: (ChannelMediaRelayEvent mediaRelayEvent) {
        // This example shows messages when relay events occur.
        // A production level app needs to handle these events properly.
        showMessage(mediaRelayEvent.toString());
    },
    ```

### Join multiple channels

The alternate approach to multi-channel live streaming is joining multiple channels. In this section, you learn how to implement joining a second channel in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

#### Implement the user interface

1. In this example, you use a single button to join and leave a second channel. To add a button to your UI, in `/lib/main.dart`, add the following lines after `ListView(...children: [` in the `build` method:

    ``` dart
    ElevatedButton(
        child: !isSecondChannelJoined
            ? const Text("Join second channel")
            : const Text("Leave second channel"),
        onPressed:  () => {joinSecondChannel()}
    ),
    ```

1. To display video from a second channel, add another video panel widget to your interface. In the `build` method, add the following code after the `Container(...)` block:

    ```dart
    Container(
        height: 240,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(border: Border.all()),
        child: Center(child: _secondVideoPanel()),
    ),
    ```

#### Implement joining multiple channels

To add multi-channel functionality to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To join and manage a second channel, in `/lib/main.dart`, add the following declarations to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    late RtcConnection rtcSecondConnection; // Connection object for the second channel
    String secondChannelName = "<name of the second channel>";
    int secondChannelUid = 100; // User Id for the second channel
    String secondChannelToken = "<access token for the second channel>";
    bool isSecondChannelJoined = false; // Track connection state of the second channel
    int? remoteUidSecondChannel; // User Id of the remote user on the second channel
    ```

1.  **Use the multi-channel enabled `RtcEngineEx` interface**

    In the SDK quickstart code, the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance was declared as `RtcEngine`. To implement multi-channel functionality, you use the multi-channel interface of the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> `RtcEngineEx`. In order to switch to the multi-user interface, do the following:

    1.  In the `_MyAppState` class, replace the declaration `late RtcEngine agoraEngine;` with:

        ``` dart
        late RtcEngineEx agoraEngine; // Agora multi-channel engine instance
        ```

    1.  In the `setupVideoSDKEngine` method, replace the line `agoraEngine = createAgoraRtcEngine();` with the following:

        ``` dart
        agoraEngine = createAgoraRtcEngineEx();
        ```

1.  **Join a second channel**

    When a user presses the button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a second channel. If the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is already connected to a second channel, it leaves the channel. To do this, add the following method to the
    `_MyAppState` class.

    ``` dart
    void joinSecondChannel() async {
        if (isSecondChannelJoined) {
            agoraEngine.leaveChannelEx(rtcSecondConnection);
            setState(() {
                isSecondChannelJoined = false;
            });
        } else {
            ChannelMediaOptions mediaOptions; 
            if (_isHost) { // Host Role
                mediaOptions = const ChannelMediaOptions(
                    publishCameraTrack: true,
                    publishMicrophoneTrack: true,
                    clientRoleType: ClientRoleType.clientRoleBroadcaster,
                    channelProfile: ChannelProfileType.channelProfileLiveBroadcasting);
            } else { // Audience Role
                mediaOptions = const ChannelMediaOptions(
                    autoSubscribeAudio: true,
                    autoSubscribeVideo: true,
                    clientRoleType: ClientRoleType.clientRoleAudience,
                    channelProfile: ChannelProfileType.channelProfileLiveBroadcasting
                );
            }

            rtcSecondConnection = RtcConnection(
                channelId: secondChannelName, 
                localUid: secondChannelUid
                );

            agoraEngine.joinChannelEx(
                token: secondChannelToken,
                connection: rtcSecondConnection,
                options: mediaOptions,
            );
            
            isSecondChannelJoined = true;
        }
    }
    ```

1.  **Receive callbacks from the second channel**

    The `RtcEngineEventHandler` registered with your instance of <Vg k="ENGINE" /> receives events from all channels that a user is connected to. To identify the channel from which a callback originates, you look at the `channelId` of the `connection` object in the callback. To enable your app to handle callbacks from both channels, in `setupVideoSDKEngine` **replace** the code block `agoraEngine.registerEventHandler(RtcEngineEventHandler(...))` with the following

    ``` dart
    agoraEngine.registerEventHandler(
      RtcEngineEventHandler(
        onJoinChannelSuccess: (RtcConnection connection, int elapsed) {
          showMessage("Local user uid:${connection.localUid} joined the channel ${connection.channelId!}");

          if (connection.channelId == channelName) {
            setState(() {
              _isJoined = true;
            });
          } else if (connection.channelId == secondChannelName) {
            setState(() {
              isSecondChannelJoined = true;
            });
          }
        },

        onUserJoined: (RtcConnection connection, int remoteUid, int elapsed) {
          showMessage("Remote user uid:$remoteUid joined the channel ${connection.channelId}");
          if (connection.channelId == channelName) {
            setState(() {
              _remoteUid = remoteUid;
            });
          } else if (connection.channelId == secondChannelName) {
            setState(() {
              remoteUidSecondChannel = remoteUid;
            });
          }
        },
        
        onUserOffline: (RtcConnection connection, int remoteUid, UserOfflineReasonType reason) {
          showMessage("Remote user uid:$remoteUid left the channel ${connection.channelId}");
          if (connection.channelId == channelName) {
            setState(() {
              _remoteUid = null;
            });
          } else if (connection.channelId == secondChannelName) {
            setState(() {
              remoteUidSecondChannel = null;
            });
          }
        },
      ),
    );
    ```

1.  **Display video from a second channel**

    In this example, you display two remote videos from two different channels. To create the widget for displaying the second video, add the following method to the `_MyAppState` class:

    ``` dart
    Widget _secondVideoPanel() {
        if (!isSecondChannelJoined) {
            return const Text(
                'Join a second channel',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            );
        } else {
            // Display remote video from the second channel
            if (remoteUidSecondChannel != null) {
                return AgoraVideoView(
                    controller: VideoViewController.remote(
                        rtcEngine: agoraEngine,
                        canvas: VideoCanvas(uid: remoteUidSecondChannel),
                        connection: rtcSecondConnection
                    ),
                );
            } else {
                return const Text(
                'Waiting for a host to join the second channel',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                );
            }
        }
    }
    ```
