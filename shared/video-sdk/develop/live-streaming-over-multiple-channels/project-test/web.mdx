### Test channel media Relay

1. In `main.js`, update `appID`, `channel` and `destChannelName`.

2. In `main.js`, set `uid` to a non-zero unsigned 32-bit integer.

3. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vpl k="CONSOLE" /> using `appID` and `channel`. Use it to update `token` in `main.js`.

4. Generate a third token in <Vpl k="CONSOLE" /> using `appID` and `destChannelName`. Use it to update `destChannelToken` in `main.js`.

5. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

6. Repeat the previous step on a second device, but this time use `appID`, `destChannelName`, and `destChannelToken` to **Join** the channel.

7. Start the dev server:

    Execute the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Use the URL displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in your browser.
