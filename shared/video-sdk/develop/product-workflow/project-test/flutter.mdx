3. In `/lib/main.dart`, update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

4. Connect a test device to your development device.

5. In your IDE, click **Run app** or execute `flutter run lib/main.dart` in a terminal window. A moment later, you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run your app, grant camera and microphone permissions.

7. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your test device as you move the slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap the **Mute** `CheckBox` while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app. You notice that the remote audio is muted on your test device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `onVolumeChanged` replace the `agoraEngine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(volume);` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid:_remoteUid!, volume:volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `onMuteChecked` replace the `agoraEngine.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(uid: _remoteUid!, mute: _isMuted);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(_isMuted);
        ```
        Run the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.

6. **Test Screen sharing**

    1. To build your app for the Windows platform, execute `flutter build windows` in a terminal window. A `build\` directory is created in your project folder that contains a Visual Studio solution. 
    
    1. [Compile the solution using Visual Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/windows/building#compiling-with-visual-studio) and run the app.
    
    1. After you join a channel, press **Start Screen Sharing**. You see your Windows screen in the web demo app and in the local video container.

    1. Press **Stop Screen Sharing**. Screen sharing stops and the camera stream is restored.
