This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic <Vpd k="NAME"/> app using the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

To start a <Vpd k="NAME" /> session, implement the following steps in your app:

- **Initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />**: Create and initialize an <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance before you call other APIs.

- **Join a channel**: Call the appropriate methods to create and join a channel.

  - **Join as a host**: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. A host publishes <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> to the channel and can also subscribe to streams from other hosts.

  - **Join as audience**: Audience members can only subscribe to streams published by hosts.

  For the Voice Calling and Video Calling use case, each user joins as a host.

- **Send and receive <Vpd k="MEDIA" />**: Hosts publish streams to the channel. Audience members subscribe to <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> streams published by hosts.

- For streaming applications, set the latency level based on your use case:

   - **Interactive live streaming**: Optimized for real-time interaction with ultra-low latency. Use this when hosts and audience need to interact quickly, such as in live Q&A sessions, interactive classrooms, or auctions.

   - **Broadcast streaming**: Optimized for scalability with slightly higher latency. Use this for large-scale events where one-way broadcasting is sufficient, such as concerts, sports events, or news broadcasts.

<Admonition type="info" title="React SDK and Web SDK relationship">
The React SDK is built on Web SDK 4.x and includes its APIs. For example, `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` calls the Web SDK `createMicrophoneAudioTrack` method.  

Use the React SDK for basic real-time audio and video features. For advanced or complex scenarios, use the Web SDK. When a feature requires the Web SDK, the React SDK documentation links to the relevant Web SDK API pages.
