To manually install <Vpd k="SDK" />:

- **Using CocoaPods**:

    1. [Ensure that you have installed **CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

    2.  In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

    3.  Open `Podfile`, and add the <Vpd k="SDK" /> pod.

        ``` bash
        // For version, fill in a specific SDK version number. For example, 4.0.0-beta.2
        pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS_Beta', 'version'
        ```
    1. Replace `version` with the version of <Vpd k="SDK" /> that you want to integrate and set `platform` to `macos, '10.11'`.

    4.  Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install <Vpd k="SDK" />. Once you successfully install <Vpd k="SDK" />:, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

    5.  Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.


- **Download <Vpd k="SDK" />**:

    1. Extract the files from [the macOS download](../../sdks) to a local folder, `<unzipped_package>`.

    2.  From the libs folder of the downloaded SDK package, copy the files or subfolders you need to the root of your project folder.

    3. In Xcode, [link your target to the frameworks or libraries](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev51a648b07) you have copied. Be sure to choose Embed & Sign from the pop-up menu in the Embed column.

        Apple does not allow an app extension to contain any dynamic library. If you are integrating the Agora SDK to an app extension, choose Do Not Embed in the Embed column.

        The Agora SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact support@agora.io if you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). <Vpd k="SDK" />: provides FAT image libraries with multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and 32/64-bit audio/video real devices.
