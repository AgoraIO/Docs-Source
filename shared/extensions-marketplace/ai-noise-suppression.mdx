### Considerations

Currently,  <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> has the following limitations:

- If the sample rate of the input signal is not 16 kHz,  <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />:
    1. Down-samples the signal to 16 kHz.
    1. Removes noise.
    1. Resamples the output signal to the original sample rate.

    This means that audio data above 8 kHz is removed in the output signal.

- In some use-cases, <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> may cause audio quality to decrease by a certain degree.
- When multiple people speak at the same time, the audio quality of lowest human voices could be decreased by a certain degree.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- If only some of the audio tracks on the current web page enable <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />, audio tracks that do not enable <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> could be affected. This is because <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> turns on AEC and AGC and turns off NS in the browser.
- Although <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> supports Safari v14.1 and greater, there are performance issues. Best practice is to not support Safari.
- <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> does not support browsers on mobile devices.
