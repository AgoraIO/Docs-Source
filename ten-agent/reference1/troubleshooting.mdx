## Development environment problems

### Script not found error 

You see the following error:

```
/app/agent/bin/start: not found
```

This error typically occurs due to incorrect line endings on Windows systems. Unix-based scripts require LF (Line Feed) endings, but Windows often uses CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed).

To resolve this issue:

1. Configure Git to preserve line endings:

    ```bash
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    ```

2. After changing this setting, either:

    - Re-clone the repository, or
    - Download the ZIP file directly from GitHub

### Environment variables not updating

Changes to your `.env` file aren't reflected in your environment.

1. Stop any running containers or services
1. Edit your .env file with the new values
1. Apply the changes:

    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    source .env  
    powershell
    ```

    ```bash
    # For Windows PowerShell
    Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match "(.+)=(.+)") {
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1], $matches[2])
      }
    }
    ```

1. Restart the containers or services

### Network connectivity issues

Verify both HTTPS and SSH connectivity to ensure proper operation:

- Test HTTPS connection

    ```bash
    ping www.google.com
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    PING google.com (198.18.1.94): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 198.18.1.94: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.099 ms
    64 bytes from 198.18.1.94: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.121 ms
    ```

- Test HTTP/API connectivity

    ```bash
    curl www.google.com
    ```

    Expected output (abbreviated):

    ```html
    <html>
    <head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

If these tests fail:

- Check your network firewall settings
- Verify proxy configurations
- Ensure DNS resolution is working correctly

## Container-specific problems

### Cannot connect to Docker container
If you cannot access services in the container:

1. Check container status:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

1. Verify port mappings:

    ```bash
    docker port ten_agent_dev
    ```

1. Inspect container logs:

    ```bash
    docker logs ten_agent_dev
    ```

### Module configuration issues

If your modules do not work correctly:

1. Verify API keys in your `.env` file
1. Check module configuration in the playground
1. Review logs for authentication errors
1. Test API connectivity from within the container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it ten_agent_dev curl -I https://api.openai.com
    ```

## Platform-specific issues

### Windows line endings
Windows users may encounter additional line-ending issues beyond the script error mentioned above.
For a comprehensive fix:

1. Set Git configuration:

    ```bash
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    ```

2. Fix existing files (if needed):

    ```bash
    # Install dos2unix if not available
    sudo apt-get install dos2unix  # Linux
    brew install dos2unix  # macOS

    # Convert files
    find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec dos2unix {} \;
    ```

1. Consider using WSL2 for a more Linux-compatible environment
