### Equipment quality test

The SDK provides the `startEchoTest` method to test the network connection and whether the audio and video devices are working properly. Refer to the following steps to implement the device quality test:

#### Start the echo test

1. Create the UMG

   Create a button control named **Btn_StartEchoTest** that you click to start the voice call loop test.

1. Bind UI events

    Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the **Btn_StartEchoTest** control and the `OnStartEchoTestClicked` callback. When you press the button to start the voice call test, the `OnStartEchoTestClicked` callback is triggered. This is shown in the following figure:

1. Implement the UI event

    Create the `OnStartEchoTestClicked` callback function. When this callback is triggered, the **Start Echo Test** method is called to start the test. When the echo test starts, the user speaks into the microphone. If the recording is played back after the set time interval, it means that the audio device and network connection are working normally. In this example, configure the `Config` parameter of **Start Echo Test** as follows:
        - **Enable Audio** is checked by default, which means audio device detection is enabled.
        - Uncheck **Enable Video** to disable video device testing.
        - Input **Token** and **Channel Id** (channel name).
        - **Interval In Seconds** is set to **2** by default. This is the time interval between when you start the call and when the recording plays back.

##### Stop voice call detection

1. Create UMG

    Create a button control named **Btn_StopEchoTest**. You click the button to stop the echo test. As shown in the following figure:

    ![Create UMG](/images/rtc-sdk/connection-status-mng-blueprint-lastmile-quality-stopechotest-umg.png)

1. Bind UI events

    Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the **Btn_StopEchoTest** control and the `OnStopEchoTestClicked` callback. The `OnStopEchoTestClicked` callback is triggered when you press the button to stop the voice call test. This is shown in the following figure:

    ![Bind UI Events](/images/rtc-sdk/connection-status-mng-blueprint-lastmile-quality-stopechotest-bind-ui-events.png)

1. Implement the UI event

    Create `OnStoptEchoTestClicked` callback function. After getting the test result, you press the stop button to trigger this callback and call the **Stop Echo Test** method to stop the test.

#### Audio recording device detection

To test whether a local audio recording device, such as a microphone, is working properly, refer to the following steps.

1. Call `StartRecordingDeviceTest` and set the `indicationInterval` parameter to the time interval after which the callback is triggered.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The SDK reports `uid = 0`, and the volume information of the device in the `FOnAudioVolumeIndication` callback.

1. When you are done testing, call `StopRecordingDeviceTest` to stop the test.

Best practice is to set the `indicationInterval` parameter to more than `200` milliseconds and not less than `10` milliseconds, otherwise the `FOnAudioVolumeIndication` callback may not be received.
</Admonition>

#### Audio playback device test

To test that the local audio playback device is working properly, refer to the following steps:

1. Call `StartPlaybackDeviceTest` and set the `testAudioFilePath` parameter to the absolute path of the audio file to be played.

1. If the user hears the audio, the playback device is working properly. The SDK triggers the `FOnAudioVolumeIndication` callback to report `uid = 1` and the volume information of the playback device.

1. When you are done testing, call `StopPlaybackDeviceTest` to stop the test.

#### Audio device loopback test

To test if the local audio device loop is working properly, refer to the following steps:

1. Call `StartAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` and set the `indicationInterval` parameter to the time interval after which the callback is triggered.

1. After starting the test, speak into the microphone. The microphone captures the sound and then plays it on the playback device. The SDK returns two `FOnAudioVolumeIndication` callbacks to report the volume information of the audio capture device with `uid= 0`, and the audio playback device with `uid= 1`, respectively.

1. When you are done testing, call `StopAudioDeviceLoopbackTest` to stop the recording device test.

### Network quality analysis

The SDK provides the `StartLastmileProbeTest` method to probe the last-mile network quality before joining a channel. The method returns information about the network quality score and network statistics. Take the following steps to run a last-mile network quality probe test:

1. Before joining a channel or switching user roles, call `StartLastmileProbeTest` to start the network test. Set the probe configuration and the expected maximum bitrate in `LastmileProbeConfig`.

1. After you start the test, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
    
    - `FOnLastmileQuality`: This callback is triggered two seconds after `StartLastmileProbeTest` is called. It provides feedback on the upstream and downstream network quality through a subjective `quality` score.

    - `FOnLastmileProbeResult`: This callback is triggered 30 seconds after `StartLastmileProbeTest` is called. It returns objective real-time network statistics, including `packetLossRate`, network `jitter`, and `availableBandwidth`.

1. Call `StopLastmileProbeTest` to stop last-mile network testing.
