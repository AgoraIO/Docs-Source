SQLCipher is used to encrypt the database that stores local messages. The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to manage local messages. Followings are the core methods:

- `getServerConversations`: Loads the conversation list from the server with pagination.
- `deleteConversation`: Deletes the conversation.
- `pinConversation`: Pins a conversation.
- `getServerPinnedConversations`: Retrieves the list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination.
