Agora <Vg k="SIG" />  provides low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and synchronization capabilities for
real-time systems. This page shows you how to easily integrate <Vg k="SIG" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg
k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

The main workflows for <Vg k="SIG" /> are:

- [Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />](#log-in-to-)
- [Peer-to-peer messaging](#peer-to-peer-messaging)
- [Chennel messaging](#channel-messaging)
- [Authentication](#authentication)

#### Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />

To log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> with authentication:

![](/images/signaling/login-to-signaling.png)

1.  The <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> requests a token from your app server.
1.  The app server returns a token to the app client.
1.  The <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> logs in to <Vg k="SIG" /> with the token.


#### Peer-to-peer messaging

To send a peer message:

![](/images/signaling/peer-to-peer-messaging.png)

1.  Client A sends a peer message to <Vg k="SIG" />.
1.  <Vg k="SIG" /> sends the message to client B. Client B receives the peer message.

#### Channel messaging

To send a message to all users in a channel:

![](/images/signaling/channel-messaging.png)

1.  Client A creates a channel and joins the channel.
1.  Clients B and C join the channel created by Client A.
1.  Client A sends a channel message to <Vg k="SIG" />.
1.  <Vg k="SIG" /> sends the channel message to clients B and C. Clients B and C receive the message.

#### Authentication

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:

- The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).

- The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.

- A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your server.

- The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for channel messaging.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

<GetStartedSDK  product="Signaling" company="Agora" sdk="Signaling SDK" client="app" />

## Next steps

Generating a token manually is not a practical solution in a production context. [Secure authentication with tokens](../develop/authentication-workflow) shows you how to use Signaling with a token that you retrieve from your server.
