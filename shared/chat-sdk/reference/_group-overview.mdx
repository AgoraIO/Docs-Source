Chat groups are features that enable instant messaging among multiple chat users. The relationship between chat group members is persistent: chat group members can send and receive messages in the group and also receive push messages when they are offline.

## Chat group types

Chat has two types of chat group: 
- Public. Public chat groups can be searched, and, depending on the settings of the group, users can join a public chat group directly or with the approval of the group owner or admin.
- Private. Private chat groups cannot be searched, and users cannot join private groups unless they are invited by a group owner or admin.

## Chat group roles and privileges

Chat groups have the following roles and privileges:

- Chat group members: Members can send and receive group messages. They do not have any administrative privileges.
- Chat group admins: Admins are members that also have some administrative privileges, including modifying the group announcements and managing chat group members (but not other admins). Admins are appointed by the chat group owner.
- Chat group owner: The owner is the group member with the most authority. When a user creates a chat group, they automatically become the group owner. Owners have the most privileges in a chat group, including appointing group admins, modifying group announcements, and managing group members (including admins). Owners can also disband the group or transfer ownership to another member.

## Chat groups vs. chat rooms

Chat groups and chat rooms both support instant messaging among multiple users. However, chat groups typically have a more consistent membership then Chat rooms. Chat group users are normally connected to the group itself; chat room users are more likely to be connected by their interest in the subject of the chat room, and so they tend to join and leave more freely.

The specific feature differences are listed in the following table:

| Feature    | Chat group   | Chat room     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where members have a preexisting relationship with each other. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream channel, they leave the chat room.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000+  |
| Message push support | Members receive push messages when they go offline. | Members do not receive push messages when they go offline. |
| Offline message storage   | This feature is supported. The server stores messages sent to offline group members and sends those messages once the members get online. A maximum number of 200 messages can be stored for group conversations for each end user. | This feature is disabled for chat rooms by default. To enable it, contact support@agora.io. After this feature is enabled, when a user joins a chat room, the server sends the latest 10 historical messages to the client side via the message receiving callback. The number of historical messages sent to the new chat room member can be increased up to 200. |
| Historical message storage | This feature is supported. You can get historical messages of a conversation from the server. | This feature is not supported for chat rooms.  |
| Message reliability | Each member receives all the messages in the chat group. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the chat room message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |
