### Create and destroy a chat room

[The app super admin](/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatroom-admins#adding-a-chat-room-super-admin) can call `createChatRoom` to create a chat room and set the chat room attributes such as the chat room subject, description, and the maximum number of members.

<div class="alert note">You are advised to call the [RESTful API](/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatrooms#creating-a-chat-room) to create a chat room from the server.</div>

```java
// The app super admin calls createChatRoom to create a chat room.
// Once the chat room is created, the super admin becomes the chat room owner.
ChatRoom  chatRoom = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().createChatRoom(subject, description, welcomMessage, maxUserCount, members);

// Only the chat room owner can call destroyChatRoom to disband the chat room.
// Once the chat room is disbanded, all the chat room members receive the onChatRoomDestroyed callback and are immediately removed from the chat room.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().destroyChatRoom(chatRoomId);
```


### Join and leave a chat room

All the chat users can all `joinChatRoom` to join the specified chat room.

```java
// Once the chat user successfully joins the chat room, all the other chat room members receive the onMemberJoined callback.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().joinChatRoom(chatRoomId, new ValueCallBack<ChatRoom>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(ChatRoom value) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(int error, String errorMsg) {

    }
});

// All the chat room members can call leaveChatRoom to leave the specified chat room. Once a member leaves the chat room, all the other members receive the onMemberExited callback.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().leaveChatRoom(chatRoomId);
```

By default, when you leave a chat room, the SDK removes all the chat room messages on the local device. If you do not want these messages removed, set `setDeleteMessagesAdExitChatRoom` in `ChatOptions` as `false`.


### Retrieve the chat room list and attributes

All chat users can get the chat room list from the server and retrieve the basic information of the specified chat room using the chat room ID.

```java
// Chat room members can call fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer to get the specified number of chat rooms from the server. The maximum value of pageSize is 100.
PageResult<ChatRoom> chatRooms = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().
                            fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer(pageNumber, pageSize);

// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomFromServer to get the basic information of the specified chat room by passing the chat room ID.
ChatRoom chatRoom = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().fetchChatRoomFromServer(chatRoomId);
```

### Listen for chat room events

To monitor the chat room events, you can listen for the callbacks in the `ChatRoomManager` class and add app logics accordingly. If you want to stop listening for the callback, make sure that you remove the listener to prevent memory leakage.

```java
public interface ChatRoomChangeListener {
    /**
     * Occurs when the chat room instance is destroyed.
     * 
     * @param roomId        The chat room ID
     * @param roomName      The chat room name
     */
    void onChatRoomDestroyed(final String roomId, final String roomName);

    /**

    void onMemberJoined(final String roomId, final String participant);

    void onOwnerChanged(final String chatRoomId, final String newOwner, final String oldOwner);

### Update the chat room member count in real time

If many members join or leave a chat room in a very short time, you can update the chat room member count in real time:

1. When a user joins a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `onMemberJoined` event. When a member leaves or is removed from a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `onMemberExited` or `onRemovedFromChatRoom` event.

1. After the event is received, you can call the `getChatRoom` method to get local details of the chat room and call the `ChatRoom#getMemberCount` method to get the current number of members in the chat room.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().addChatRoomChangeListener(new ChatRoomChangeListener() {

        @Override
        public void onMemberJoined(String roomId, String participant) {
            //Get the current number of members in the chat room.
            ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().getChatRoom(roomId).getMemberCount();
        }

        @Override
        public void onMemberExited(String roomId, String roomName, String participant) {
            //ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().getChatRoom(roomId).getMemberCount();
        }

    });
```
