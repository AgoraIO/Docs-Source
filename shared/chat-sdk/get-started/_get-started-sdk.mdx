Instant messaging enhances user engagement by enabling users to connect and form a community within the app. Increased engagement can lead to increased user satisfaction and loyalty to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. An Instant messaging feature can also provide real-time support to users, allowing them to get help and answers to their questions quickly. The <Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to embed real-time messaging in any app, on any device, anywhere.

This page guides you through implementing peer-to-peer messaging into your app using the <Vpd k="SDK"/> for <Vpl k="NAME" />.


## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of sending and receiving peer-to-peer messages using <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

![understand](/images/chat/get-started-sdk-understand.png)

1. Clients retrieve an authentication token from your app server.
1. Users log in to the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat Server using the app key, their username, and token.
1. Clients send and receive messages through the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat Server as follows:
	1. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Chat Server. 
	1. The server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives a message, the SDK triggers an event.
	1. Client B listens for the event to read and display the message.

### Generate a user token

To ensure communication security, Agora recommends using tokens to authenticate users who log in to the Agora Chat system.

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating temporary tokens for Agora Chat. To generate a user token, do the following:

1. On the **Project Management** page, click **Config** for the project that you want to use.

	![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1664531061644)

2. On the **Edit Project** page, click **Config** next to **Chat** below **Features**.

	![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1664531091562)

3. In the **Data Center** section of the **Application Information** page, enter the [user ID](#userid) in the **Chat User Temp Token** box and click **Generate** to generate a token with user privileges.

### Next steps

For demonstration purposes, Chat provides an app server that enables you to quickly retrieve a token using the App Key given in this guide. In a production context, the best practice is for you to deploy your own token server, use your own [App Key](enable#get-the-information-of-the-agora-chat-project) to generate a token, and retrieve the token on the client side to log in to Agora. To see how to implement a server that generates and serves tokens on request, see <Link to="../develop/authentication">Generate a User Token</Link>.
