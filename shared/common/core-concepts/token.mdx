#### Tokens

A token is a dynamic key generated using the App ID, App Certificate, user ID, and expiration timestamp. Tokens authenticate and secure access to <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s services, ensuring only authorized users can join a channel and participate in real-time communication.

Tokens are generated on your server and passed to the client for use in the <Vg k="VSDK" /> or <Vg k="MESS" />. The token generation process involves digitally signing the App ID, App Certificate, user ID, and expiration timestamp using a specific algorithm, preventing tampering or forgery.

For testing and during development, use the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to generate temporary tokens. For production environments, implement a token server as part of your security infrastructure to control access to your channels.
