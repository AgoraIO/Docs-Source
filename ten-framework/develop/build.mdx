  Build TEN framework applications and addons using ten_gn for C++ and Go commands for Golang projects.
---

The TEN framework provides language-specific build systems to compile applications and addons including extensions, extension groups, and protocols. TEN uses build processes that vary by language but follow consistent patterns for each platform and architecture combination. This guide covers how to build TEN projects using the appropriate build tools for each supported language.

## C++

The TEN framework uses `ten_gn`, a build system based on Google's GN, to compile C++ applications and extensions.

### Build parameters

When building C++ projects, specify the following parameters:

- **Platform**: `linux`, `mac`, `win`
- **Architecture**: `x86`, `x64`, `arm`, `arm64`
- **Build type**: `debug`, `release`

### Build applications

To build a C++ application, run the following commands in the project root directory:

```shell
ten_gn gen <os> <arch> <build_type>
ten_gn build <os> <arch> <build_type>
```

### Build addons

You can build C++ addons such as extensions, extension groups, and protocols using the same process as applications:

```shell
ten_gn gen <os> <arch> <build_type>
ten_gn build <os> <arch> <build_type>
```

## Go

The TEN framework uses standard Go commands with TEN-specific build scripts for Go projects.

### Build applications

To build a Go application, run this command in the project root directory:

```shell
go run ten_packages/system/ten_runtime_go/tools/build/main.go
```
