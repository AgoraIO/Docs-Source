This method disconnects an ongoing stream based on SID.

### Prototype

- Method: `DELETE`
- Endpoint: `https://api.agora.io/:region/v1/projects/:appId/rtls/ingress/online-streams/:sid`

You can combine this method with [deleting the streaming key](../streaming-key/delete-streaming-key) to implement the function of disabling the stream. Deleting the streaming key only removes it from the database. You can no longer use the streaming key, but you cannot disconnect the ongoing push. To disconnect, use one of the following methods:

1. Call to [delete the streaming key](../streaming-key/delete-streaming-key) and then call this method to disconnect the ongoing push.

    <Admonition type="caution" title="Important">Make sure to delete the streaming key first; otherwise, after using this API to force a disconnection, the push software will immediately reconnect. A new push session, corresponding to a new SID, will be generated, and the disconnection will fail.</Admonition>

1. Call to [kick the user out of the channel](/video-calling/reference/channel-management-rest-api). This API can also force the user to disconnect. If the kicking API has been integrated, you can continue to use it to disconnect the stream.

### Request parameters

**Authentication**

<Authorization/>

**Path parameters**

| Parameter   | Data type | Required/Optional | Description             |
| :---------- | :-------  |:----------------- | :---------------------- |
| `appId`     | String    | Required          | The app ID provided by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to each developer. After creating a project in <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>, you can get an app ID. The app ID is a unique identifier for a project. |
| `region`    | String    | Required          | Create an area for pushing the streaming key. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> supports creation of stream keys by region. Currently, the following regions are supported: <ul><li>`na`: North America</li><li>`eu`: Europe</li><li>`ap`: Asia, except mainland China</li><li>`cn`: Mainland China</li></ul><Admonition type="caution" title="Important">Make sure that: <ul><li>The `region` value is the same as for the input source stream.</li><li>The domain names for setting the `region` parameter and streaming are the same. </li><li>The `region` value is in lowercase.</li></ul></Admonition>|
| `sid`       | String    | Required          | The streaming session ID is the unique identifier for each initiated streaming task. It can be obtained by [querying the streaming list](query-streaming-list) or receiving the payload of the [message notification callback](../../../../develop/receive-notifications).|

**Headers**

| Header         | Data type | Description             |
| :------------- | :-------  |:----------------------- |
| `X-Request-ID` | String    | The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of the request. After passing in this field, the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> server will return this field in the response header. It is recommended to assign `X-Request-ID` a value. If no value is assigned, the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> server will automatically generate a UUID and pass it in. |

### Request example

```shell
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.agora.io/region/v1/projects/appId/rtls/ingress/online-streams/sid \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic 123' \
  --header 'X-Request-ID: '
```

### Response parameters

**Headers**

| Header         | Data type | Description             |
| :------------- | :-------  |:----------------------- |
| `X-Request-ID` | String    | The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of the request. The value is in its `X-Request-ID` header. If a request error occurs, print the value in the log to troubleshoot the problem. A `401 (Unauthorized)` response status code means that there is no such field in the response header.|

**Response body**

For details about possible response status codes, see [Response status codes](../../response-status-codes).

If the status code is not `200`, the request fails. See the `message` field in the response body for the reason for this failure.

If the status code is `200`, the request succeeds, and the response body includes the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Type   | Description                                                        |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`         | String | The status of this request. `success` means the request succeeds.  |

### Response example

The following is a response example for a successful request:

```json
{
  "status" : "string"
}
```
