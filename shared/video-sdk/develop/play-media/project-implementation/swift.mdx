### Implement the user interface

In a real-word application, you provide several buttons to enable a user to open, play, pause and stop playing files in the media player. In this page, you use a single `UIButton` to demonstrate the basic media player functions. You also add a `UIProgressView` to display the play progress to the user.

To create this user interface, in the `ViewController` class:

1.  **Add UI elements to control video play and show progress**

    Add the following variables at the top of the class with the other declarations:

    <CreateUI />

2.  **Configure the buttons in your interface**

    Add the following lines to the `initViews` function:

    <ConfigureButtons />

### Handle the system logic

To setup your project to use the media player APIs and access the UI elements, take the following steps:

1.  **Declare the variables you need**

    To create and manage an instance of the media player and access the UI elements, add the following declarations to `ViewController`:

    ```swift
    var mediaPlayer: AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol? // Instance of the media player
    var isMediaPlaying: Bool = false
    var mediaDuration: Int = 0
    // In a real world app, you declare the media location variable with an empty string
    // and update it when a user chooses a media file from a local or remote source.
    var mediaLocation =
            "https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Custom-VideoSource-Web/assets/sample.mp4"
    ```

### Implement media player functions

To implement playing and publishing media files in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1.  **Open, play and pause media files**

    When a user presses the button for the first time, you create an instance of the media player, set its `mediaPlayerBtnClicked` function to receive the callbacks, and open the media file. When the user presses the button again, you play the media file. On subsequent button presses, you pause or resume playing the media file alternately. To do this, add the following `mediaPlayerBtnClicked` function to the `ViewController` class:

    <OpenPausePlayMedia />

2.  **Manage media player callbacks**

    The `AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate` implements media player callbacks. When the player state changes, update the UI using the `didChangedToState`, `didChangedToPosition` callbacks. To setup the `AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate`, add the following extension to the `ViewController`:

    ```swift
    extension ViewController: AgoraRtcMediaPlayerDelegate {
        func agoraRtcMediaPlayer(_ playerKit: AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol, didChangedTo state: AgoraMediaPlayerState, error: AgoraMediaPlayerError) {
            if (state == .openCompleted) {
                // Media file opened successfully
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.showMessage(title: "Media Player", text: "Media file opened successfully")
                }
                mediaDuration = mediaPlayer!.getDuration()
                // Update the UI
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.mediaPlayerBtn.setTitle("Play Media File", for: .normal)
                    weakself.mediaPlayerBtn.isEnabled = true
                    weakself.mediaProgressView.progress = 0
                }
            } else if (state == .playBackAllLoopsCompleted) {
                isMediaPlaying = false
                // Media file finished playing
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.mediaPlayerBtn.setTitle("Load Media File", for: .normal)
                    // Restore camera and microphone streams
                    weakself.setupLocalVideo(false)
                    weakself.updateChannelPublishOptions(false)
                }
                // Clean up
                agoraEngine.destroyMediaPlayer(mediaPlayer)
                mediaPlayer = nil
            }
        }

        func agoraRtcMediaPlayer(_ playerKit: AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol, didChangedToPosition position: Int) {
            if (mediaDuration > 0) {
                let result = (Float(position) / Float(mediaDuration))
                DispatchQueue.main.async {[weak self] in
                    guard let weakself = self else { return }
                    weakself.mediaProgressView.progress = result
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Configure <Vg k="ENGINE" /> to publish the media player stream**

    You use the `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` class and the `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` method functions to specify the type of stream to publish. To switch between publishing media player and camera and microphone streams, add the following function to the `ViewController`:

    ```swift
    func updateChannelPublishOptions(_ publishMediaPlayer: Bool) {
        let channelOptions: AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions = AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions()

        channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerAudioTrack = publishMediaPlayer
        channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerVideoTrack = publishMediaPlayer
        channelOptions.publishMicrophoneTrack = !publishMediaPlayer
        channelOptions.publishCameraTrack = !publishMediaPlayer
        if (publishMediaPlayer) { channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerId = Int(mediaPlayer!.getMediaPlayerId()) }

        agoraEngine.updateChannel(with: channelOptions)
    }
    ```

4.  **Display media player output locally**

    Create an `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas` and use it in the `setupLocalVideo` method of the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> to show the media player output locally. To switch between displaying media player output and the camera stream, replace the `setupLocalVideo()` method in the `ViewController` with the following:

    ```swift
    func setupLocalVideo(_ forMediaPlayer: Bool) {
        // Enable the video module
        agoraEngine.enableVideo()
        let videoCanvas = AgoraRtcVideoCanvas()
        videoCanvas.view = localView
        videoCanvas.renderMode = .hidden
        videoCanvas.mirrorMode = .auto
        videoCanvas.uid = 0

        // Pass the AgoraRtcVideoCanvas object to the engine so that it renders the local video.
        if (forMediaPlayer) {
            videoCanvas.sourceType = .mediaPlayer
            videoCanvas.sourceId = mediaPlayer!.getMediaPlayerId()
        } else {
            // Start the local video preview
            agoraEngine.startPreview()
        }

        // Set the local video view
        agoraEngine.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)
    }
    ```

5.  **Update the `joinChannel` method**

    When you join a channel, you set up the local video panel to initially display the camera output. In the `joinChannel()` function, replace `setupLocalVideo()` with a call to the updated function:

    ```swift
    setupLocalVideo(false)
    ```

6.  **Clean up when you leave the channel**

    To free up resources when you exit the channel, add the following lines at the end of the `leaveChannel` function:

    ```swift
    // Destroy the media player
    agoraEngine.destroyMediaPlayer(mediaPlayer)
    mediaPlayer = nil
    ```
