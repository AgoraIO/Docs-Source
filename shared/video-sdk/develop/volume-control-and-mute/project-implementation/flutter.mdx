### Adjust the playback volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```dart
const int volume = 50;
// Set the local playback volume to 50 for all remote users 
await _rtcEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
// Set the local playback volume for a specific remote user. For example, user with uid 1000
await _rtcEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid: 1000, volume: volume);
```

### Adjust the recording volume
Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```dart
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
int vol = 50;
await _rtcEngine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(vol);
```

When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and the options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
* A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
* If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
* The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
* If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Mute and unmute users

To mute or unmute the local audio stream, call `muteLocalAudioStream`:

    ```dart
    // Stop publishing the local audio stream
    _rtcEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(true);

    // Resume publishing the local audio stream
    _rtcEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(false);
    ```
    

To mute or unmute a remote user, call `muteRemoteAudioStream` with the `uid` of the remote user:

    ```dart
    // Stop subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    _rtcEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, true);

    // Resume subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    _rtcEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, false);
    ```
    
### Get volume information of users

<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback. You use the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note" style="background-color:yellow">Call `enableAudioVolumeIndication` to enable reporting of the users' volume in the callback.</Admonition>
```dart
// Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
// their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
_rtcEngine.registerEventHandler(RtcEngineEventHandler(
  onAudioVolumeIndication: (RtcConnection connection,
      List<AudioVolumeInfo> speakers, int speakerNumber, int totalVolume) {
    logSink.log(
      '[onAudioVolumeIndication] speakers: ${speakers.toString()}, speakerNumber: $speakerNumber, totalVolume: $totalVolume');
    }
));
```
