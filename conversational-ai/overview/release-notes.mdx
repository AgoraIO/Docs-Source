## Releases

### v1.1

#### New features

[Create a conversational agent](../rest-api/join) API adds `enable_rtm`and `agent_rtm_uid` fields to enable the Signaling function for the <Vpd k="AGENT" />. After enabling, the agent can combine the capabilities provided by the Signaling SDK to obtain the user's speaking status, selected text, signature, score and other custom context information, and pass this information to the agent to guide the agent to output content that better meets the user's needs. For details, see [Passing Custom Information](../develop/custom-information).

#### Improvements

To help you quickly integrate a custom large language model, this version introduces documentation for custom large language models. Refer to the sample code in the documentation to integrate your custom model into the conversational AI engine and enable advanced capabilities such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal processing, and tool invocation.

#### API Changes

The `POST` method for creating a <Vpd k="AGENT" /> now includes the `enable_rtm` and `agent_rtm_uid` fields.

### v1.0 (Public Beta)

This version, released on March 4, 2025, adds pricing information for the Agora <Vpd k="NAME" />. For more information, see [Pricing](../overview/pricing).
