## Sample project

The complete <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_MARKETPLACE_BASE_URL}}/FaceUnity/ios/ExtensionExample/ViewController.m"><Vg k="RTEE_FU"/> iOS sample code and project</Link> is available on GitHub.

#### Run the sample project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
	git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/AgoraMarketPlace.git
    ```
1. On the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/marketplace/list/all">Extensions Marketplace Downloads</Link> page, download the iOS package of FaceUnity AR Filter. Unzip the package, save all `.framework` files to `FaceUnity/ios/ExtensionExample`, and change **Embed** to **Embed & Sign**.
1. Visit the [<Vg k="RTEE_FU" /> extension page](https://console.agora.io/marketplace/extension/introduce?serviceName=faceunity-ar-en), click **Contact Us**, and fill in the details to obtain an exclusive certificate file from <Vg k="COMPANY" />. 

    Provide the package name to be bound to the license and change `Bundle Identifier` of the project to your own bound package name. For example, `yourCompany.yourProject.faceunity`. You receive the `authpack.h` certificate file that corresponds to your package name. 

1. Save the certificate file `authpack.h` to `FaceUnity/ios/ExtensionExample`.
1. Download the [FaceUnity resource package](https://download.agora.io/marketplace/release/FaceUnity_v8.4.1_Resources.zip).
1. Save the required model and prop files from the resource package to `FaceUnity/ios/Resource` under the project folder.
1. In Terminal, go to the `FaceUnity/ios directory`, and run the following command to install dependencies using CocoaPods:
    ```
  	pod install
    ```
1. Open the project `FaceUnity/ios/ExtensionExample.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
1. Import the certificate file `authpack.h` into the project.
1. Open the `Config.h` file and replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>` with your App ID and the value of `token` with a valid token. To get an App ID, see [Getting Started with Agora](../../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id).

   ```objective-c
   NSString *const appID = @"<YOUR_APP_ID>";
   NSString *const token = nil;
   ```
1. Connect an iOS device (not an emulator), and run the project.

    If successful, the sample project is installed on your iOS device.

1. When the app is launched, the FaceUnity extension is enabled by default. You can see the `disableExtension` , `enableAITracking` , `setComposer`, and `setSticker `buttons on the user interface.
1. Perform the following steps:
   - Click `enableAlTracking` to ` enable `face, gesture, and body recognition. You can see the recognition results in the upper right corner.
   - Click `setComposer` to set the beauty effect, and drag the **Color Level** or** Filter Level** to adjust the beautification intensity.
   - Click `setSticker` to load the props. The default is a cat ear effect.
