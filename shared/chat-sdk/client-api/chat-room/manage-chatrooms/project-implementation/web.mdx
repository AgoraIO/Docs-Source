### Create and destroy a chat room

The [app super admin](agora_chat_restful_chatroom_superadmin) can create a chat room and set the chat room attributes such as the chat room name, description, and the maximum number of members. Once a chat room is created, the super admin automatically becomes the chat room owner.

Only the chat room owner can disband a chat room. Once a chat room is disbanded, all members of that chat room are immediately removed from the chat room.

```javascript
// The super admin can call createChatRoom to create a chat room.
let options = {
    name: 'chatRoomName', // The name of the chat room
    description: 'description', // The description of the chat room
    maxusers: 200, // The maximum number of members. Default value: 200. Maximum value: 5,000.
    members: ['user1', 'user2'] // (Optional) The chat room members. Specify at least one user.
}
conn.createChatRoom(options).then(res => console.log(res))

// The chat room owner can call destroyChatRoom to disband a chat room.
let option = {
    chatRoomId: 'chatRoomId'
}
conn.destroyChatRoom(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```

### Join and leave a chat room

All chat users can call `joinChatRoom` to join the specified chat room. Once a chat user joins a chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `memberPresence` callback.

All chat room members can call `leaveChatRoom` to leave the specified chat room. Once a chat room member leaves a chat room, all the other members receive the `memberAbsence` callback.

```javascript
// All chat users can call joinChatRoom to join the specified chat room.
let option = {
    roomId: 'roomId',
    message: 'reason'
}
conn.joinChatRoom(option).then(res => console.log(res))

// All chat room members can call leaveChatRoom to leave the specified chat room.
let option = {
    roomId: 'roomId'
}
conn.leaveChatRoom(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```

### Retrieve the chat room list and attributes

All chat users can get the chat room list from the server and retrieve the basic information of the specified chat room using the chat room ID.

```javascript
// Chat room members can call getChatRooms to retrieve the specified number of chat rooms from the server by page. The maximum value of pageSize is 1,000.
let option = {
    pagenum: 1,
    pagesize: 20
};
conn.getChatRooms(option).then(res => console.log(res))
														
// Chat room members can call getChatRoomDetails to get the basic information of the specified chat room by passing the chat room ID.
let option = {
    chatRoomId: 'chatRoomId'
}
conn.getChatRoomDetails(option).then(res => console.log(res))
```


### Listen for chat room events

To monitor the chat room events, you can call `addEventHandler` to listen for the callbacks and add app logics accordingly.

```javascript
conn.addEventHandler("eventName", {
  onGroupEvent: function(msg){
    switch(msg.operation){
         // Occurs when all the chat room members are unmuted.
        case 'unmuteAllMembers':
            break;
        // Occurs when all the chat room members are muted.
        case 'muteAllMembers':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member is removed from the chat room allow list.
        case 'removeAllowlistMember':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member is added to the chat room allow list.
        case 'addUserToAllowlist':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member deletes a chat room announcement.
        case 'deleteAnnouncement':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member updates a chat room announcement.
        case 'updateAnnouncement':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member is removed from the chat room mute list.
        case 'unmuteMember':
            break;
        // Occurs when a member is added to the chat room mute list.
        case 'muteMember':
            break;
        // Occurs when a chat room admin is removed from the admin list.
        case 'removeAdmin':
            break;
        // Occurs when a chat room member is added to the admin list.
        case 'setAdmin':
            break;
        // Occurs when the chat room owner is changed.
        case 'changeOwner':
            break;
        // Occurs when a chat room member leaves a chat room.
        case 'memberAbsence':
            break;
        // Occurs when a user joins a chat room.
        case 'memberPresence':
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
  }
})
```
