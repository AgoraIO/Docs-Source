You integrate <Vg k="SIG" /> in order to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You also use <Vg k="SIG" /> to
enhance the user experience for <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" />.

This page shows you how to easily integrate <Vg k="MESS" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

Pub-sub is the simplest form of messaging. Each user logs into <Vg k="MESS" />. a channel is created when a user
sends a message to a peer. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for peer events which contain the messages users send to
each other.

To join a channel, you use an authentication token. That is, a computer-generated string that
authenticates the user with <Vg k="MESS" />. The token is bound to the user UID.
One concurrent user only may login from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from
Token Generator. To understand how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see
    [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

To create a pub-sub session for <Vg k="MESS" /> , implement the following steps in your
<Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

<GetStartedSDK  product="Signaling" company="Agora" sdk="Signaling SDK" client="app" />

## Next steps

Generating a token manually is not a practical solution in a production context. [Secure authentication with tokens](../develop/authentication-workflow) shows you how to use Signaling with a token that you retrieve from your server.
