After a user sends a message to another chat user or chat group, this user expects to know whether the message is delivered or read. The Chat SDK provides the message receipt feature, which enables you to send a receipt to the message sender once the message is delivered or read.

This page introduces how to use the Chat SDK to implement message receipt functionalities in one-to-one chats and chat groups.
