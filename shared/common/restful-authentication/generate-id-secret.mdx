### Generate Customer ID and Customer Secret

To generate a set of customer ID and customer secret, do the following:

1.  In <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>, click **Developer Toolkit** > **RESTful API**.

2.  Click **Add a secret**, and click **OK**. A set of customer ID and customer secret is generated.

3.  Click **Download** in the **Customer Secret** column. Read the pop-up window carefully, and save the downloaded `key_and_secret.txt` file in a secure location.

4.  Use the customer ID (key) and customer secret (secret) to generate a Base64-encoded credential, and pass the Base64-encoded credential to the `Authorization` parameter in the HTTP request header.

You can download the customer secret from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> only once. Be sure to keep it secure.

### Generate an authorization header using a third-party tool

For testing and debugging, you can use a [third-party online tool](https://www.debugbear.com/basic-auth-header-generator) to quickly generate your Authorization header. Enter your Customer ID as the Username and your Customer Secret as the Password. Your generated header should look like this::

```
Authorization: Basic NDI1OTQ3N2I4MzYy...YwZjA=a
```
