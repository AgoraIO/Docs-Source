Some special scenarios require streaming over two or more separate channels. Depending on the scenario, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins both channels as host, both channels as audience, or one channel as host and the other as audience. For example, consider the case of an online singing contest, where hosts of different channels interact with each other. The audience receives streams from two channels while the contestants broadcast to both channels.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="VSDK" /> multi-channel streaming allows you to join multiple channels at the same time and broadcast or receive audio and video over them. This page shows you how to implement two different multi-channel methods into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="VSDK" />. Choose the method that best fits your particular scenario.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="COMPANY" />  <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the following approaches to implementing multi-channel streaming:

* **Channel media relay**

    In channel media relay, one channel is used as the source channel from which audio and video is relayed to a second channel called the destination channel. The audience on the destination channel subscribes to the relayed media stream. A host can relay media stream to a maximum of four destination channels. Relaying media streams provides the following benefits:

        * All hosts in the channels can see and hear each other.
        * The audience in the channels can see and hear all hosts.

* **Join multiple channels**

    To join multiple channels, a host first sets up a primary channel and starts an event. The host then joins a second channel and publishes to the new channel. The audience joins either channel and subscribes to the host channel. The two channels are independent and users on one channels don't see users on the other channel. You can extend this functionality to join as many channels as required.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to add multi-channel streaming to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you need to have implemented the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>.

## Implement multi-channel streaming

This section shows you how to implement **Channel media relay** and **Join multiple channels** methods for multi-channel streaming. Choose the method that best suits your scenario and follow the step by step procedure.

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented multi-channel streaming into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. **[Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />**.

2. **Configure the web demo you use to connect to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>**:

    In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg
    k="COMPANY"/> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

## Reference

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

- Ensure that each RtcConnection object has a unique user ID that is not 0.
- You can configure the publishing and subscribing options for the RtcConnection object in joinChannelEx.
- Each RtcConnection can publish multiple audio streams and a video stream simultaneously.
- When calls to `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` are too frequent, they are rejected and `RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_UPDATE_DEST_CHANNEL_REFUSED(8)` is returned.
