Reducing the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size is of great significance in improving user experience. A smaller package size means that users consume less bandwidth and time to download the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. Consider the following scenarios where app size optimization is critical:

- There are strict requirements on the size of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. For example, running the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> on smart wearable devices with limited storage space.

- The target user group of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is located in underdeveloped areas. The poor network connectivity causes the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> download time to be too long.

This page shows you how to optimize the size of <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s with integrated <Vg k="VSDK" />.

### Use the <Vg k="ASDK" />
<Vg k="VSDK" /> supports both audio and video functions, and the package size is large. If you only need to use audio features, best practice is to integrate the [Voice SDK](../../sdks). For details, see [<Vg k="ASDK" /> Quickstart](/en/voice-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk?platform=android).

### Remove unnecessary plugins
<Vg k="VSDK" /> provides optional plugin dynamic libraries. The name of the plugin is suffixed with `extension`. See the [plugin list](#plugin-list) for details on the function and size of the plugins. Refer to the following ways to exclude these plugins to reduce the size of the app.
