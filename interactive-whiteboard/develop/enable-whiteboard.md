  Enable and configure Interactive Whiteboard
---

To use <Vg k="WHITE" />, you need to enable and configure it in [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/#onboarding).

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the whiteboard feature, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- A valid Agora account. If you have a Netless account, you must complete the account migration first. See [Migrate from Netless to Agora](../develop/migration-guide).
- Active Agora projects. If you have not created a project, see [Manage projects](../reference/manage-agora-account/#create-and-manage-projects).

## Enable the <Vg k="WHITE" />

Follow these steps to enable the <Vg k="WHITE" /> in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />:

1. Log in to [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/), and click the **Project Management** icon on the left navigation panel.

2. On the **Project Management** page, click **Config** for the project for which you want to enable the <Vg k="WHITE" />.

4. Read the pop-up prompt carefully and click **Confirm**. 
   The **Enable** button changes to the **Config** button, which allows you to configure the <Vg k="WHITE" />.

## Get security credentials for your whiteboard project

<Vg k="CONSOLE" /> assigns the following security credentials to each whiteboard project:

- **AppIdentifier**: The unique App Identifier, which is required for initializing the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" />.
- **AK** and **SK**: A pair of access keys, which you can use to generate whiteboard tokens. See [Generate a Token at App Server](../develop/generate-token-app-server).
- **sdkToken**: An [SDK Token (a dynamic key)](../develop/authentication-workflow) for test purposes. In a production environment, you need to generate an SDK Token at your app server either by using the [code samples](../develop/generate-token-app-server) or calling the [RESTful API](../develop/generate-token-rest). 

To get the security credentials, do the following steps:

1. On the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, find the project that has the whiteboard feature enabled, and click **Edit**.

2. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Whiteboard** and click **Config**.

3. Navigate to the **Basic information** section, click the eye icon to copy the **AppIdentifier**, **AK**, and **SK**. Save them to a secure location.

4. Click **Generate sdk Token**, read the pop-up prompt carefully, and then click **Copy sdkToken**. Save the SDK Token to a secure location.

Unexpected exposure of the security credentials can cause severe security problems. To enhance security, Agora recommends the following practices:

- Do not send the AK and SK to your app clients or hard-code them in your app. Ensure that only your app server is allowed to read the keys from the configuration file.
- Because the SDK Token generated at the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> grants a high level of permission, do not send them to your app clients; otherwise, there might be a risk of leakage.

## Enable whiteboard server-side features

<Vg k="WHITE" /> sets up [five data centers](../reference/security#network-geofencing) and each data center provides the following server-side features: 

- File conversion, including **Docs to Picture** and **Docs to web**. 
After enabling the file conversion feature, you can call the [RESTful APIs](../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion) to launch a file conversion task or query the conversion progress.
Agora charges for the file-conversion feature. See [Pricing](../reference/pricing).
- **Screenshot**. After enabling the screenshot feature, you can call the [RESTful APIs](../reference/whiteboard-api/screenshots) to take screenshots.

Follow these steps to enable one or more features and configure the storage settings:

1. Go to the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, find the project that has the whiteboard feature enabled, and click **Edit**.

2. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Whiteboard** and click **Config**.

3. Under **Services**, select a data center and click **Config**. The data center must be the same as the one you fill in the `region` field when calling the [Create a room](../reference/whiteboard-api/room-management#create-a-room-post) API; otherwise, the service configurations do not take effect.

4. On the **Services configuration** page, select **Enabled** for **Docs to Picture**, **Docs to web**, or **Screenshot**.

5. Set up the storage space:
- Click the arrowhead to the right of **Storage** and select a previously configured storage space in the drop-down list.
- Click **Create** to add a new storage space. You need to fill in the following information:
   - **Name**: (Required) The name of your storage space.
   - **Vendor**: (Required) The third-party cloud storage vendor. 
   - **Region**: (Required) The location of the data center you specified when creating a bucket.
   - **accessKey**: (Required) The Access Key provided by the third-party cloud storage vendor, which is used by the vendor to identify visitors.
   - **secretKey**: (Required) The Secret Key provided by the third-party cloud storage vendor, which is used to authenticate signatures.
   - **bucket**: (Required) The name of the bucket.
   - **Storage path**: The path used to save the resources in the storage space. The default is the root directory.
   - **Domain**: The domain name used to access the third-party cloud storage service.
 
        - To get the above information about a third-party storage service, see the documentation provided by the vendor.
        - You should enable **public access** or higher permission for third-party storage spaces so that your app clients can access files saved in the space.
 
6. Click **Save**, read the pop-up prompt carefully, and click **Confirm**.
