  Real-time interaction with AI agents

<Vpd k="NAME" /> RESTful APIs enables you to add an AI agent to a specified <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel for 1-on-1 communication with an end user. This page describes how to call the <Vpd k="NAME" /> RESTful APIs to start and stop an AI agent.

## Understand the tech

Agora’s Conversational AI technology enables real-time voice interactions between a user and an AI-driven agent within an Agora channel. The basic process is as follows:

1. **User joins the Agora channel**:  A user joins an Agora channel.
1. **Start an AI agent**: The user sends a request to your business server, which then makes an API call to the Conversational AI engine to start an agent. The agent joins the same channel as the user.
1. **Real-time interaction**: The user communicates with the AI agent through voice, leveraging the specified LLM, a text-to-speech service, and Agora's low-latency SD-RTN™.
1. **Stop the AI agent**: When the user ends the conversation, the business server sends a request to stop the AI agent. The agent then leaves the Agora channel.
1. **User leaves the Agora channel**: The user disconnects from the session.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have:

- Implemented the voice or [video calling quickstart](/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your app.
- The following information from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />:
    - [App ID](../get-started/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id): The string identifier for your project used to call the <Vpd k="NAME" /> RESTful API.
    - A [temporary token](../get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-temporary-tokens): A token is used to authenticate users when joining an Agora channel. 
- [Customer ID and Customer secret](../rest-api/restful-authentication#generate-customer-id-and-customer-secret): Used for HTTP authentication when calling the Conversational AI RESTful APIs.
- Enabled the Agora conversational AI engine for your project by contacting [Agora technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).
- Obtained the API key and callback URL from the Large Language Model (LLM) provider.
- Obtained the API key from the text-to-speech (TTS) provider.

## Implementation

This section introduces the basic RESTful API requests you use to start and stop a <Vpd k="NAME" /> agent. The requests are presented here as `curl` commands. In a production environment, implement these requests on your business server.

### Start a conversational AI agent

Call the `join` endpoint to create an agent instance that joins an Agora channel. Pass in the `channel` name and `token` for agent authentication.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.agora.io/api/conversational-ai-agent/v2/projects/<your_app_id>/join \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '
{
  "name": "unique_name",
  "properties": {
    "channel": "channel_name",
    "token": "token",
    "agent_rtc_uid": "0",
    "remote_rtc_uids": ["*"],
    "enable_string_uid": false,
    "idle_timeout": 120,
    "llm": {
      "url": "https://api.xxxx/v1/xxxx",
      "api_key": "xxx",
      "system_messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a helpful chatbot."
        }
      ],
      "greeting_message": "Hello, how can I help you?",
      "failure_message": "Sorry, I don't know how to answer this question.",
      "max_history": 10,
      "params": {
        "model": "xxxx",
        "max_token": 1024
      }
    },
    "asr": {
      "language": "zh-CN"
    },
    "tts": {
      "vendor": "vendor_name",
      "params": {}
    }
  }
}'
```

For a complete descriptions of all request parameters, see [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join).

If the request is successful, you receive the following response:

```json
/// 200 OK
{
  "agent_id": "1NT29X10YHxxxxxWJOXLYHNYB",
  "create_ts": 1737111452,
  "state": "RUNNING"
}
```

Store the `agent_id` for use in subsequent API calls to query, update, and stop the AI agent.

### Stop the conversational AI agent

To end the conversation with the AI agent, call the `leave` endpoint. This causes the agent to leave the Agora channel.

```bash
curl --request post \
  --url https://api.agora.io/cn/api/conversational-ai-agent/v2/projects/<your_app_id>/agents/<agentid>/leave \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>'
```

If the request is successful, you receive the following response:

```json
/// 200 OK
{}
```
