2. **Set up an event listener to check status**

    In your  <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, add the following event listener to `agoraEngine`:

      ```javascript
      agoraEngine.on("image-moderation-connection-state-change", (cur, prev) => {
        console.log("AF status:", "prev", prev, "cur", cur);
      });
      ```

1. **Enable image moderation**

   To enable `ImageModeration` in your app, call `setImageModeration` after the user joins a channel and the local video is published and played. If you use a string UID to join the channel and want to receive it in the webhook callback, pass the string UID to `YourExtraInfo` inside `setImageModeration`.

      ```javascript
      agoraEngine
        .setImageModeration(true,extraInfo: "YourExtraInfo",{ interval: 1000 })
        .then((e) => console.log("!AF on", e));
      ```

1. **Show an alert when the current user is kicked from the channel**

    When the current user is kicked, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends the `connection-state-change` event showing that the
        current user has been banned. Read the `reason` from `connection-state-change` event as follows:

      ```javascript
      agoraEngine.on("connection-state-change", (cur, prev, reason) => {
        console.log("connection:", "prev", prev, "cur", cur, "reason:", reason);
        if (reason === ConnectionDisconnectedReason.UID_BANNED) {
          if (confirm("You are kicked from this channel, reload?")) {
            window.location.reload();
          }
        }
      });
      ```

</PlatformWrapper>
