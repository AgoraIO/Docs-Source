This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic <Vpd k="NAME"/> app using the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

To start a <Vpd k="NAME" /> session, implement the following steps in your app:

- **Initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />**: Create and initialize an <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance before you call other APIs.

- **Join a channel**: Call the appropriate methods to create and join a channel.

  - **Join as a host**: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. A host publishes <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> to the channel and can also subscribe to streams from other hosts.

  - **Join as audience**: Audience members can only subscribe to streams published by hosts.

- **Send and receive <Vpd k="MEDIA" />**: Hosts publish streams to the channel. Audience members subscribe to <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> streams published by hosts.
