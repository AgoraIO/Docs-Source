To enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. On the **Projects** tab, locate the project for which you want to enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> and click **Edit**.

    ![Project tab](/images/video-sdk/enable-ncs-project-tabs.png)

1. In the **All Features** section, open the **Notifications** tab and click on the service for which you want to enable notifications. The section expands to show configuration options.

    ![Notification tab](/images/video-sdk/enable-ncs-notification-tab.png)

1. Fill in the following information:

    * **Event**: Select all the events that you want to subscribe to.

        If the selected events generate a high number of queries per second (QPS), ensure that your server has sufficient processing capacity.

    * **Receiving Server Region**: Select the region where your server that receives the notifications is located. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> connects to the nearest <Vg k="COMPANY" /> node server based on your selection.

    * **Receiving Server URL Endpoint**: The `HTTPS` public address of your server that receives the notifications. For example, `https://1111-123-456-789-99.ap.ngrok.io/ncsNotify`.

        <Admonition type="info">
        For enhanced security, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> no longer supports `HTTP` addresses.
        </Admonition>

        * To reduce the delay in notification delivery, best practice is to activate `HTTP` persistent connection (also called `HTTP` keep-alive) on your server with the following settings:

            * `MaxKeepAliveRequests`: 100 or more
            * `KeepAliveTimeout`: 10 seconds or more
    
    * **Whitelist**: If your server is behind a firewall, check the box here, and ensure that you call the [IP address query API](#ip-address-query-api) to get the IP addresses of the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server and add them to the firewall's allowed IP list.

1. Copy the **Secret** displayed against the product name by clicking the copy icon. You use this secret to [Add signature verification](#add-signature-verification).

1. Press **Check**. Agora performs a health test for your configuration as follows:

    1. The <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> health test generates test events that correspond to your subscribed events, and then sends test event callbacks to your server. 
        <ProductWrapper product="video-calling, voice-calling, interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
        In test event callbacks, the channelName is `test_webhook`, and the uid is `12121212`.
        </ProductWrapper>
    1. After receiving each test event callback, your server must respond within 10 seconds with a status code of `200`. The response body must be in JSON format.

    1. When the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> health test succeeds, read the prompt and press **Apply Settings**. After your configuration is saved, the **Status** of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> shows **Enabled**.

        If the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> health test fails, follow the prompt on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to troubleshoot the error. Common errors include the following:

        * Request timeout (590): Your server does not return the status code `200` within 10 seconds. Check whether your server responds to the request properly. If your server responds to the request properly, contact Agora Technical Support to check if the network connection between the Agora <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server and your server is working.

        * Domain name unreachable (591): The domain name is invalid and cannot be resolved to the target IP address. Check whether your server is properly deployed.

        * Certificate error (592): The Agora <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server fails to verify the SSL certificates returned by your server. Check if the SSL certificates of your server are valid. If your server is behind a firewall, check whether you have added all IP addresses of the Agora <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server to the firewall's allowed IP list.

        * Other response errors: Your server returns a response with a status code other than `200`. See the prompt on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for the specific status code and error messages.
