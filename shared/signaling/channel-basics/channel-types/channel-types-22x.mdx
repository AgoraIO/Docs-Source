- **Message channel**

    A message channel uses a communication method similar to the MQTT protocol. It follows the pub/sub (publish-subscriber) model to deliver messages. In message channels, instead of creating a channel in advance, you simply publish messages to a specified channel or subscribe to receive messages from a channel. Due to the flexibility of the model, you can easily implement different topologies such as one-to-one channels, group channels, broadcast channels, and unicast channels. Since the number of subscribers can be larger, this channel type does not guarantee sending delivery receipts from all subscribers after receipt of a message. See [Message channels](../core-functionality/message-channel) for implementation details.
    
- **User channel** 

    Use this channel type to implement a one-to-one topology. User channels enable you to send peer-to-peer messages to a specified `userId`. To send a message to a user channel, simply set the `channelType` parameter in the `publish` method to <code>{props.channelType}</code>  and the `channelName` to the `userId` of the recipient. To receive messages sent to your `userId`, you don't need to subscribe; you just implement the <code>{props.messageEvent}</code> event listener. User channels support delivery receipts. When a publisher sends a message, the API returns `success` if the receiver is online and receives the message successfully. If the receiver is not online or the reception fails, the method returns `failure` or `timeout`. Although you can use the return value to determine if the recipient is online, best practice is to use the `Presence` functionality for this purpose.

- **Stream channel**

    This is a special type of channel based on the room concept that is similar to the observer pattern. In stream channels, users cannot send messages directly to a channel. You call the `joinTopic` method to register as a publisher of a topic before sending messages. To receive messages, users subscribe to the specified message publisher, identified by the `userId`, in the specified topic. In stream channels, client-side messages support delivery at higher QPS. This channel type is often recommended for scenarios such as Metaverse, parallel driving, and cloud gaming. See [Stream channels](../core-functionality/stream-channel) for implementation details.

The channel types are distinguished in the API by `channelType`. Apart from differences in the message sending and receiving mechanism, the features and use of message channels and stream channels for other features and events such as `Presence`, `Storage`, and `Locks`, is the same. User channels do not support these features as they are simple message pass-through channels.
