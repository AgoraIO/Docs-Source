The <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> is the latest generation of the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> launched by Agora to help developers quickly build whiteboard applications. It simplifies the APIs of the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> and implements the core functionality with a default user interface (UI). In addition, the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> integrates [window-manager](https://github.com/netless-io/window-manager) and extensions from [netless-app](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app) to allow developers to easily extend the functionality of their whiteboard applications. With the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" />, you do not need to learn the complex concepts of the interactive whiteboard; you can join a whiteboard room with a few lines of code and instantly use the rich editing tools to start real-time interactive collaboration.

## v1.0.0
v1.0.0 was released on March 6, 2022. This is the first official release of the UI Kit for Android.

#### Features

**Implementations of the core whiteboard functionality and user interface (UI)**

This release directly implements the basic functions of the interactive whiteboard with a default UI. After integrating the UI Kit and calling `join` to join the whiteboard room, you can use the following functions:

- The whiteboard toolbar, which includes all basic whiteboard editing tools, such as pencil, text editor, and shape tools. It also supports setting stroke width, font size, and stroke color.

- The whiteboard page control, which enables you to add and switch whiteboard pages.

- The view control, which you can use to zoom in and out of the current whiteboard page and adjust the view.

- Undo and redo an action.

In addition, the UI Kit provides the following APIs to enable you to implement these functions with customized UIs:

- `setAppliance`

- `setStrokeWidth`

- `setStrokeColor`

- `undo`

- `redo`

#### Display files

The UI Kit supports inserting and displaying files in multiple formats on the whiteboard, such as images in PNG and JPG formats, audio and video in MP3 and MP4 formats, and documents in PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF formats. For detailed implementation steps, see [Display Files](/interactive-whiteboard/develop/display-files).
