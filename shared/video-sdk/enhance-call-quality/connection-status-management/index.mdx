In real-time audio and video implementations, the connection state between the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> changes as the client joins or leaves the channel. The connection may also be interrupted due to network or authentication issues.

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">

This page describes the various channel connection states, reasons for state changes, and how to handle these changes to better manage your users and troubleshoot network faults.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the various connection states and how the connection state changes between a user joining and leaving a channel:

##### Disconnection and reconnection

During the communication process, if the user is disconnected due to network problems, the SDK automatically enables the disconnection and reconnection mechanism. The following figure shows the callbacks received by the local user `UID1` and the remote user `UID2` when:

* A local user joins the channel
* A network exception occurs
* The connection is interrupted
* The user rejoins the channel
