3. Run the sample project

    1. In the terminal, navigate to the output folder using the following command:

        ```bash
        cd out/x86_64
        ```
    
    1. Launch the compiled app

        Execute the following command to launch the app. Remember to replace the app Id, channel Id and token with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

        ```bash
        ./hello_rtsa --app-id <your-app-id> --channel-id <your-channel-name> --token <authentication-token>
        ```

    You hear an audio file being played and see a video file in the web demo app, pushed from the <Vpd k="NAME"/> demo project.

1. Customize the demo code

    Open the file `<extracted-folder>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example/hello_rtsa/hello_rtsa.c` in your code editor and modify the code to suit your application.
