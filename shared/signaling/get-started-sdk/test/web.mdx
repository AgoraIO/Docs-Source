Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In `index.html`, replace `your_appid` and `your_token` values in the code with your project's app ID and token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="info">
    To quickly verify the basic functionality during the testing phase, set the **Authentication mechanism** to **Debugging mode** when creating the Agora project, and then replace both `your_appid` and `your_token` values with your project's app ID.
    </Admonition>

1. Update the value for the `userId` with an integer value.

1. Save the file and run it in your browser. 

1. Make a copy of the project. Use the same `app_id` but a different `userId`. Launch another instance of the page in a separate browser tab. 

1. Type a message in the text input box in either instance and click the **Send** button. The message is displayed in the other app instance.

1. Swap the sending and receiving instances and send another message.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
