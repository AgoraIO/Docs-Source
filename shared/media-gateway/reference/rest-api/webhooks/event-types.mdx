#### 1 live_stream_connected

The gateway has received the RTMP or SRT stream and successfully entered the channel.

Payload example:

```json
{
    "sid": "55df7402-8778-11ee-92ed-07ec2e86c928",
    "region": "na",
    "streamKey": "7B***Qbs",
    "rtcInfo": {
        "channel": "123",
        "uid": "1234"
    },
    "beginAt": "2023-11-21T02:27:31Z"
}
```

The payload contains the following fields:

| Field       | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sid`       | String    | The unique ID of each streaming session. |

| `beginAt`   | String    | The start time of the streaming in the `RFC3339` format. |

This event is usually followed by a corresponding `live_stream_disconnected` event.

#### 2 live_stream_disconnected

#### 3 live_stream_aborted

The gateway has received an RTMP or SRT stream but terminated it for some reason.

Payload example:

```json
{
    "sid": "55df7402-8778-11ee-92ed-07ec2e86c928",
    "region": "na",
    "streamKey": "7B***Qbs",
    "rtcInfo": {
        "channel": "123",
        "uid": "1234"
    },
    "beginAt": "2023-11-21T02:27:31Z",
    "errorCode": 100,
    "reason": "invalid"
}
```

The payload contains the following fields:

| Field       | Data type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sid`       | String    | The unique ID of each streaming session. |
| `region`    | String    | The server area that has received the pushed stream. |
| `streamKey` | String    | The used streaming key. |
| `rtcInfo`   | Object    | RTC information: <ul><li>`channel`: The channel name.</li><li>`uid`: The host UID. Supports integer and string data types.</li></ul>|
| `beginAt`   | String    | The start time of the streaming in the `RFC3339` format. |
| `errorCode` | Number    | The stream termination error code. |
| `reason`    | String    | The error message. |

This event may be sent alone or between the `connected` and `disconnected` events.

The possible values for the `errorCode` field include the following:

| Value | Description | Recommended actions |
|------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| `1` | Illegal `streamKey`. For example, `channelName` is empty or contains illegal characters. | Check the `streamKey` format,  especially for locally generated ones. |
| `2` | Invalid `streamKey` (expired or deleted) | Create a new `streamKey` and try again. |
| `3` | No permission to use this `streamKey`. For example, the customer-defined domain name and `streamKey` under the associated app ID do not match. | Check whether the `streamKey` matches the domain name used for the push.|
| `4` | Number of concurrent streams exceeds the limit. | Wait and retry. |
| `5` | Conflict detected, for example, pushing to the same channel and at the same. | If the streams are not being pushed at the same time, try again 5-10 seconds later. |
| `6` | The stream attribute exceeds the limit (currently applies to bitrate only). | Check the streaming software configuration and lower the target bitrate. |
| `7` | Streaming without any audio or video data for more than 10 seconds | Check whether the last push exited abnormally, and then try again. |
| `8` | Failed to join channel | The `reason` field will provide the specific error reason, for example: `"connect to rtc failed, reason:$N"`. Refer to the API documentation for details. |
| `9` | Disconnected from the main network. Specific reasons need to be investigated by contacting technical support. | Try again several times. If you still have problems, [contact technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) to confirm whether the app certificate provided during activation is valid. |
| `10` | Unknown  internal service error. Specific reasons need to be investigated by contacting technical support. | Try again a few times. If you still have problems, [contact technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). |

#### 4 live_profile_updated

Stream properties have been updated. For example, the first audio or video frame has been received or the audio or video profile has changed.

        "uid": "1234"
    },
    "videoProfile": {
        "codec": "H.264",
        "width": 1920,
        "height": 1080
    },
    "audioProfile": {
        "sampleRate": 48000,
        "channels": 2
    },
    "beginAt": "2023-11-21T02:27:31Z"
}
```
