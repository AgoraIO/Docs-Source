The TEN Cloud Store is a centralized repository for TEN packages, similar to Google Play Store or Apple App Store. It provides a curated collection of extensions, apps, and system components that you can download directly into your TEN applications to accelerate development and add functionality.

## Available package types

The TEN Cloud Store offers the following types of packages for download:

- **App**: Complete TEN applications ready for deployment
- **Extension Group**: Collections of related extensions that work together  
- **Extension**: Individual components that add specific functionality
- **System**: Core framework components and runtime services
- **Protocol**: Communication protocols for inter-extension messaging

## Package information

The cloud store maintains detailed metadata for each TEN package to ensure proper dependency resolution and version management:

- **Package type**: Identifies the category of package: `extension`, `app`, `extension_group`, `protocol`, or `system`.

- **Package name**: Unique identifier for the package, such as `builtin_extension` or `audio_processor`.

- **Package version**: Version number following [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) standards, such as `3.0.0`.

- **Dependencies**: Array of required packages with their version constraints:
    - **Type**: Package category matching the supported types above
    - **Name**: Exact package identifier  
    - **Version**: Version requirement using semver syntax, such as `~3.0.0` or `^2.1.0`

This structured metadata enables automatic dependency resolution and ensures compatibility when integrating packages into your TEN applications.
