## Integrate FCM with Chat

This section guides you through how to integrate FCM with Chat.

### 1. Create a project in Firebase

1. Log in to [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and click **Add project**.

1. On the **Create a project** page, enter a project name, and proceed with prompts.

1. Query the sender ID. On the **Project settings** page, select the **Cloud Messaging** tab and view **Sender ID**. When uploading the FCM certificate to <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, set the certificate name to the FCM sender ID.

1. On the **Project settings** page, select the **Service accounts** tab and click **Generate new private key** to generate a JSON file. Save this file and upload it to <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> when using the V1 certificate.

    ![push_fcm_private_key](/images/chat/push_fcm_private_key.png)

1. After the project is created, add an `iOS` application or an `Android` application according to the following steps:

- Add an `iOS` app:
   1. The package name is the same as that of the `iOS` app;
   2. Once created, move the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the root directory of the `Xcode` project, and add it to all targets;
   3. Upload the `APNs` certificate on the Cloud Messaging page.

- Add an `Android` app:
   1. The package name is the same as that of the `Android` app;
   2. Once created, move the downloaded `google-services.json` file to your module (application level) root directory.

For detailed FCM configurations, you can see the [React Native Firebase document](https://rnfirebase.io/).

### 2. Upload FCM certificate to <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

After successfully logging into Chat, you can upload the FCM push certificate to <Vg k="CONSOLE" />:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>, and click **Project Management** in the left navigation bar.

1. On the **Project Management** page, locate the project that has Chat enabled and click **Config**.

1. On the project edit page, click **Config** next to **Chat**.

1. On the project config page, select **Features** > **Push Certificate** and click **Add Push Certificate**.

1. In the pop-up window, select the **Google** tab, and configure the following fields:

    ![push_fcm_add_certificate](/images/chat/push_fcm_add_certificate.png)

    | Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description              |
    | :--------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------------- |
    | **Certificate Type** | | No | Select whether to use a V1 certificate or a legacy certificate. <ul><li>**V1**: Recommended. You need to configure a **Private Key**. </li><li>**Legacy**: Will soon be deprecated. You need to configure a **Push Key**.</li></ul>|
    | **Private Key** | file | Yes | Click **Generate new private key** on the **Project settings** > **Service accounts** page of the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) to generate the `.json` file, then upload it to <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. |
    | **Push Key** | String | Yes | FCM Server Key. Obtain the server key in the **Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)** area of the **Project settings** > **Cloud Messaging** page of the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). <br/> <br/> **This parameter is only valid for legacy certificates.**|
    | **Certificate Name** | String | Yes | The sender ID configured for the FCM. <ul><li>For the new version of the certificate, you can find the sender ID on the **Project settings** > **Cloud Messaging** page of the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). </li><li>For legacy certificates, go to the ***Project settings > Cloud Messaging** page of the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), and get the sender ID in the **Cloud  Messaging API (Legacy)** area. </li></ul><br/> The certificate name is the only condition used by the Agora server to determine which push channel the target device uses, so ensure that the sender set when integrating FCM in Chat is consistent with what is set here. |
    | **Sound** | String | No | The ringtone flag for when the receiver gets the push notification. |
    | **Push Priority** | | No| Message delivery priority. See [Setting the priority of a message](https://firebase.google.cn/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#setting-the-priority-of-a-message). |
    | **Push Msg Type** | | No| The type of the message sent to the client through FCM. See [Message types](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages): <ul><li>**Data**: Data message, processed by the client application. </li><li>**Notification**: Notification message, automatically processed by FCM SDK. </li><li>**Both**: Notification messages and data messages can be sent through the FCM client. </li></ul>|

#### Switch from legacy to the V1 certificate

The legacy HTTP or XMPP API is being retired on June 20, 2024. In view of this, switch to the latest FCM API (HTTP v1) version of the certificate as soon as possible. See [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) for details.

Make sure that the uploaded V1 certificate is available, as the legacy one will be deleted upon upload. If the new certificate is not available, the push will fail.

Take the following steps to switch from the old to the new certificate:

1. Click **Edit** in the **Action** column of the old certificate on the **Push Certificate** page.

    ![push_fcm_oldcertificate_edit](/images/chat/push_fcm_oldcertificate_edit.png)

1. In the **Google** tab of the **Edit Push Certificate** window, switch the **Certificate Type** to **V1**.

    ![push_fcm_oldcertificate_switch](/images/chat/push_fcm_oldcertificate_switch.png)

1. Click **Upload** to upload the locally saved V1 certificate file (.json).

    ![push_fcm_newcertificate_upload](/images/chat/push_fcm_newcertificate_upload.png)

1. Click **OK** to complete the switch.

### 3. Integrate FCM on the client

Take the following steps to integrate FCM on the client:

1. Add dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn add @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging react-native-agora-chat
    ```

1. Add native platform configuration:

    **Android**

    1. Download the `google-services.json` file and put it in the following path in your project: `/android/app/google - services.json`.
    1. In your `/android/build.gradle` file, add the google-services plugin as a dependency:

        ```groovy
        buildscript {
          dependencies {
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
          }
        }
        ```

    1. Add the google-services plugin to the `/android/app/build.gradle` file and execute the plugin:

        ```groovy
        apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // <- Add this line
        ```

    **iOS**

    1. Modify the `Podfile` configuration file:

        ```ruby
        #Set the version of the Firebase SDK integrated in the React Native app.
        $FirebaseSDKVersion = '10.12.0'
        #Set up Firebase to use the static framework.
        $RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true
        ```

        ```ruby
        target 'rn_firebase_push_demo' do
          pod 'GoogleUtilities', :modular_headers => true
          pod 'FirebaseCore', :modular_headers => true
        end
        ```

    1. Run the `pod install` command in the `ios` directory to install dependencies.

    1. Open the `/ios/{projectName}.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

    1. Right-click the project name, select **Add files** , then select the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your local computer, and make sure to select **Copy items if needed**.

    1. To do this, open the `/ios/{projectName}/AppDelegate.mm` file (`AppDelegate.m` in earlier versions of React Native).

    1. At the top of the file, import the Firebase SDK after **#import "AppDelegate.h"**.

        ```objective-c
        #import <Firebase.h>
        ```

    1. In the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, add the following code at the top:

        ```objective-c
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
          [FIRApp configure];
        }
        ```

#### FCM push code implementation

1. Set up message notifications:

    ```typescript
    React.useEffect(() => {
      const sub1 = messaging().onMessage(async (remoteMessage) => {
        // Process offline message notifications, such as printing logs and displaying messages.
        console.log("A new FCM message arrived!", JSON.stringify(remoteMessage));
      });
      return sub1;
    }, []);
    ```

1. Initialize the Chat SDK:

    ```typescript
    // Get the device token.
    fcmToken.current = await messaging().getToken();
    // Push settings.
    const pushConfig = new ChatPushConfig({
      deviceId: senderId,
      deviceToken: fcmToken.current,
    });
    // Configure push settings in the ChatOptions class.
    let o = new ChatOptions({
      autoLogin: false ,
      appKey: appKey,
      pushConfig: pushConfig,
    });
    // Execute settings and initialize the IM SDK.
    ChatClient.getInstance()
      . heat ( o )
      .then(() => {
        // Initialization successful.
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Initialization failed and error message is returned.
      });
    ```

1. Log in to the server:

    ```typescript
    // Log in to the server using user ID and token.
    ChatClient.getInstance()
      .loginWithAgoraToken(username, token)
      .then(() => {
        // Login successful.
      })
      .catch((reason) => {
        // Login failed, return error message.
      });
    ```

1. Send the device token to the server:

    ```typescript
    // Send device token to the server.
    ChatClient.getInstance()
      .updatePushConfig(
        new ChatPushConfig({ deviceId: senderId, deviceToken: fcmToken.current })
      )
      .then(() => {
        // Sent successfully.
      })
      .catch((reason) => {
        // Sending failed, returning error information.
      });
    ```

## Test FCM push

After integrating and enabling FCM, you can test whether the push feature is successfully integrated.

Prerequisites​

### Prerequisites

Make sure your test device meets the following conditions:

- Uses foreign IP addresses to establish connections.
- Supports Google GMS services (Google Mobile Services).
- Can access Google network services; otherwise, the device won't be able to receive push notifications from the FCM service.

For more reliable testing, use a physical device.

### Test push notifications

1. Log in to the app on your device and confirm that the device token is successfully bound.

    You can check the log or call [RESTful API for getting user details](../../restful-api/user-system-registration#querying-a-user) to confirm whether the device token is successfully bound. If successful, there will be a `pushInfo` field under the `entities` field, and `pushInfo` will have relevant information such as `device_Id`, `device_token`, `notifier_name`, and others.

1. Enable app notification bar permissions.

1. Kill the application process.

1. Send a test message in the Agora Console.

    Select **Operation Management** > **User** in the left navigation bar. On the **Users** page, select **Send Admin Message** in the **Action** column for the corresponding user ID. In the dialog box that pops up, select the message type, enter the message content, and then click **Send** .

   <Admonition type="info" title="Note">In the **Push Certificate** page, in the **Action** column of each certificate, click **More** and **Test** will appear. This is to directly call the third-party interface to push. The message sending test in the **Users** page first calls the Chat message sending interface and then the third-party interface when the conditions are met (that is, the user is offline, the push certificate is valid and bound to the device token).</Admonition>

1. Check your device to see if it has received the push notification.

### Troubleshooting

In case of issues, take the following steps:

1. Check whether FCM push is correctly integrated or enabled:

    Select **Operation Management** > **User** in the left navigation bar. On the **User Management** page, select **Push Certificate** in the **Action** column for the corresponding user ID. In the pop-up box, check whether the certificate name and device token are displayed correctly.
1. Check whether the correct FCM certificate is uploaded in the Agora Console.
1. Check whether the message is pushed in the chat room. The chat room does not support offline message push.
1. Check if the device supports GMS.
