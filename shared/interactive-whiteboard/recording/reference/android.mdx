### Development considerations

When using the recording and playback features, note the following:

* **Lightweight wrapper**: The Android SDK provides the `FastReplay` class to simplify playback configuration, but core functionality is still provided by the underlying Whiteboard SDK.
* **Multi-window playback**: If you used multi-window mode during recording, enable multi-window support in both the SDK configuration and playback configuration, and set the correct window aspect ratio.
* **Recording delay**: Recording content is not generated in real time. Newly created rooms may need to wait for a period of time before the recording content becomes available.
* **Time range**: Set an appropriate playback time range based on your usage scenario to avoid playing unnecessary content.
* **Network buffering**: Playback may require network buffering, especially when seeking to a distant point in time.
* **Synchronous and asynchronous methods**:
   * Synchronous methods (such as `getPlayerPhase()`) return locally cached values, which may not be the latest values.
   * Asynchronous methods (such as `getPhase(promise)`) return the latest value obtained from the JavaScript side.
   * Use synchronous methods for routine tasks and asynchronous methods for debugging.
* **Thread safety**: `PlayerListener` callbacks execute on a child thread. UI operations require switching to the main thread using `runOnUiThread()`.
* **State synchronization**: When using `PlayerSyncManager`, you must call `updateWhitePlayerPhase` in the `onPhaseChanged` callback. Otherwise, state cannot be synchronized correctly.
* **Resource release**: Remember to call `player.stop()` and `release()` or `fastReplay.destroy()` to release player resources after use.

### Check if the room can be replayed

Before creating a playback player, check if playback data is available for the room:

```java
whiteSdk.isPlayable(playerConfig, new Promise<Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public void then(Boolean isPlayable) {
        if (isPlayable) {
            // Playback data is available, create the player
            whiteSdk.createPlayer(playerConfig, listener, promise);
        } else {
            Log.w(TAG, "No playback data is available for this room");
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void catchEx(SDKError error) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Failed to check playback status: " + error.getMessage());
    }
});
```
