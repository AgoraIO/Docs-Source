1.  Generate a temporary token in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1.  In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

1.  In Unreal Studio, open `MyUserWidget.h`, and update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values for your temporary token.

1.  In Unreal Studio, click **Play**. A moment later you see the <Vpl k = "CLIENT"/> running on your device.

    If this is the first time you run the project, grant microphone and camera access to your app.

1.  Press **Join** to see the video feed from the web app.

    You see the local video in the local view and remote video in the remote view. This means your <Vpl k = "CLIENT"/> is rendering the capture video frames that you receive in the following callbacks:

    -  `onRenderVideoFrame`: Gets the remote user video frame data.

    -  `onCaptureVideoFrame`: Gets the captured video frame data.


1.  Test processing of raw audio data.

    Edit the `IAudioFrameObserver` callbacks by adding code that processes the raw audio data you receive in the following callbacks:

    -   `onRecordAudioFrame`: Gets the captured audio frame data

    -   `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: Gets the audio frame for playback
