To ensure reliability of Media Push, follow the advice on this page when integrating <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful APIs.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to start using Media Push RESTful API:

- The scene of the channel is live, profile set to `BROADCASTING`
- Media Push is enabled
- To monitor Media Push events, enable [<Vg k="NCS_LONG" />](../../video-calling/develop/receive-notifications) (optional).

## Limitations

### QPS

The Agora server limits the number of queries per second (QPS) to the Media Push RESTful API.
When the QPS is exceeded, the status code `429` (Too Many Requests)
is returned. If you need a higher QPS limit, contact technical support.


|API   |QPS limit                                             |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Create    |Creating a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Delete    |Deleting a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Update    |Updating a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Get       |Getting the request rate of a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|

### Maximum number of concurrent tasks

The default maximum number of concurrent tasks is 20, which indicates
that a maximum of 20 Media Push tasks can be run simultaneously in one
project. If a higher quota is required, contact technical support.

## Ensure the high availability of REST services

To ensure the high availability of REST services and prevent downtime caused by regional network faults, Agora provides
failover and domain name switch.

### Failover

Network failures and risks may be caused by cloud and network software, infrastructure, and other factors that Agora cannot control.
To provide the best possible user experience, Media Push provides high availability automatic task migration for failure recovery.
After a failure is confirmed, the Media Push task is migrated within 120 seconds. During this period, the task may be interrupted.

Consider whether you can accept the impact of high availability migration based on your own business characteristics, and decide whether to adopt higher quality assurance measures. For example, create multiple Media Push tasks for critical scenes. Alternatively, you can make periodic API calls and monitor notifications to get the latest task status, then create a new task with a different UID once you confirm the task status is unhealthy.

### Multiple Media Push tasks

If you need a more reliable solution than fault recovery, you can use a multiple Media Push task strategy. You can choose the following two ways to implement it:

1.  Start the main push task and multiple backup tasks at the same time.
    Set a different CDN address for each Media Push task. When the main
    Media Push task fails, the CDN audience can switch to the backup CDN
    address in time.

2.  If the CDN vendor you use supports the feature of pushing several
    streams to the same CDN address with different priorities,
    create a Media Push task No. 1 to the CDN with priority 1
    (`<rtmp://xxx/xxx/xxx>? priority=1`). If task 1 fails, create
    task 2 with priority is 2. In this case, task 1 is ignored by the CDN.
    The priority fields of different CDNs are different. Check with the CDN vendor
    whether the priority function is supported and what the name of the
    priority field is.

For use cases with higher quality requirements, requesting multiple Media Push tasks with different tagging enables isolated resources for these tasks and raises the success rate. Media Push supports room-level isolation for tasks. For example, if there is a task with `"name":"my-task"` in the original request, you can add a suffix to the `name` parameter to realize isolation at the computer room level. Use `"name":"my-task-agora-isolate-1"` and `"name":"my-task-agora-isolate-2"` to start additional tasks. Note that:

* If resources are insufficient, then tasks started later fails.
* Media Push supports up to three-way isolation, That is, `my-taskagora-isolate1`, `my-task-agoraisolate-2`, and `my-taskagora-isolate-3` can be separated.

## Create RTMP Converter

When creating a converter with a `create` call, pay attention to the following:

- Create the converter by region parameter:
    - The region you set must be in the same area as your CDN origin station. For example, if your CDN origin is located in the US, set region to `na`.
    - Pass the region value in lowercase.
- Agora recommends that you assign a string value to the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header. The Agora server returns an `X-Custom-request-ID` field in the response header for troubleshooting purposes.
- Set UID or account as the user name for the converter. Do not set these two fields at the same time. Ensure that each converter has a unique user name within the channel.
- To avoid repeated media streaming due to repeated creation of multiple converters, it is recommended to use the name field to manage converters under a specific project.    At the same time, converters with the same names cannot exist in a project. If you attempt to create a converter with the same name, you receive the `409` (Conflict) status code.
-   Agora recommends that you assign the name using a combination of the channel name and a converter property. For example, `show68_horizontal` and `show68_vertical` would represent a horizontal and a vertical layout respectively.
-   `audioOption` and `videoOptions` are set as follows for audio only or video only scenarios:
    - In a video only scenario, you do not need to set `audioOptions` and its related fields.
    - In a audio only scenario, you do not need to set `videoOptions` and their related fields.
    - In audio plus video scenarios, `videoOptions` and `audioOptions` are required and cannot be left blank. If you do not need to configure `audioOptions` set it to `null`.

-   Set an appropriate value for `idleTimeout`. The default value of 300 seconds is recommended. It means that the converter is automatically destroyed, 300 seconds after all subscribers leave the channel.

## Update RTMP converter

When updating a specified converter with an `Update` call, pay attention
to the following:

When you use the query parameter sequence to update the same converter
multiple times, ensure that the sequence value increases. Media Push updates the converter according to the latest update request, that is, the maximum sequence number.

The Update API does not support the following configuration parameters:

- `name`
- `idleTimeOut`
- `transcodeOptions.rtcChannel`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.codecProfile`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.sampleRate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.bitrate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.audioChannels`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codec`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codecProfile`

## Troubleshooting and recommended measures

### Retry with retreat strategy

If you receive `404`, `429`, or `5xx` error codes, use a backoff strategy. For example, wait 5-6 seconds, 10-11 seconds, or 15-16 seconds and try again. If you get three consecutive `404` or `5xx` error codes, or if the `state` field in the response to checking the status of a Media Push task says `failed`, it means that the Media Push task has failed. To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1.  Check whether the CDN address is correct.
2.  If the CDN address is correct, destroy the current converter and create a new one.

### Troubleshooting by error code

- If the status code is 200, the request is successful.
- If the status code is not `200`, the request has failed. See the error message in the response body for clarification.

|Status code               |Possible error message |Possible reason of failure |Measures to take|
|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:--------|:----------|
|`400` Bad Request         |Invalid parameter: `rtmpUrl`. Replace and retry. Invalid parameter: `idleTimeout`. Replace and retry.	|Wrong parameters. Check by referring to the `reason` field in the HTTP response body.|
|`401` Unauthorized        |Invalid authentication credentials.	|RESTful API authentication failed.	|See [RESTful Authentication](../reference/restful-authentication)|
|`403` Forbidden           |No valid permission to use this function. Contact us.	|Service is not enabled.	|Enable the service.|
|`404` Not Found           |Resource is not found and destroyed. |The task was not started or is in the process of failover or deletion. |Retry following the retreat strategy.|
|`409` Conflict            |Resource with the same name already exists. Use the existing resource or delete it and create a new resource.|	Resource with the same name already exists. |Delete the existing converter and create a new one.|
