### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `getServerConversations` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation). In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

<div class="alert note">Do not use mixed upper-case.</div>

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is `20`.
// cursor: The cursor position for starting to get data. If you pass in an empty string (''), the SDK retrieves conversations from the latest active one.
connection.getServerConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''}).then((res)=>{
    console.log(res)
})
```

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

You can call `getHistoryMessages` based on the `searchOptions` object parameter to pull message history of a one-to-one or group chat from the server. This includes pulling messages by sender, message type, or time period. To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull 20 messages at a time, with a maximum of 50. If the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the `pageSize` value, then only the `pageSize` number of messages will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the `pageSize` value.

For group chats, you can pull messages sent by individual members of the group by setting the `from` parameter of `searchOptions`.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note">
<ul><li>To use this API, upgrade to v1.3.0 or above.</li>
<li>By default, you can retrieve message history of one-to-one and group chats. To obtain message history of a chat room, contact support@agora.io.</li>
<li>The storage time of message history and offline messages on the server is defined by your pricing package. See [Pricing plan details](../../reference/pricing-plan-details).</li>
<li>For event notifications, if the receiving user is offline, the storage time of the event notification is consistent with the storage time of the offline message, which also depends on your pricing package.</li></ul>
</Admonition>

Refer to the following code sample:

```javascript
connection.getHistoryMessages({
  targetId: 'targetId', // The user ID of the peer user for one-to-one chat or group ID for group chat.
  chatType: 'groupChat', // The chat type: `singleChat` for one-to-one chat or `groupChat` for group chat.
  pageSize: 20, // The number of messages to retrieve per page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is 20.
  searchDirection: 'down', // The message search direction: `up` means to retrieve messages in the descending order of the message timestamp and `down` means to retrieve messages in the ascending order of the message timestamp.
  searchOptions: {
    from: 'message sender userID', // The user ID of the message sender. This parameter is used only for group chat.
    msgTypes: ['txt'], // An array of message types for query. If no value is passed in, all types of message will be queried.
    startTime: new Date('2023,11,9').getTime(), // The start timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
    endTime: new Date('2023,11,10').getTime(), // The end timestamp for query. The unit is millisecond.
  },
});
```

You can also call `getHistoryMessages` to pull messages of a specified conversation from the server, in the chronological or reverse chronological order.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull a maximum of 50 messages at a time and do multiple iterations, if necessary.

```javascript
let options = {
   // The other party's user ID, group ID, or chat room ID.
   targetId: "user1",
   // The number of messages expected to be pulled per page. The value range is [1,50], and the default value is 20.
   pageSize: 20,
   // The starting message ID of the query. If this parameter is set to `-1`, `null`, or an empty string, start with the latest message.
   cursor: -1,
   // Session type: (default) `singleChat`: single chat; `groupChat`: group chat; `chatRoom`: chat room
   chatType: "groupChat",
   // Message search direction: (default) `up`: Pull in the reverse order from the time when the server received the message; `down`: Pull in the chronological order from the time when the server received the message.
   searchDirection: "up",
};
WebIM.conn
   .getHistoryMessages(options)
   .then((res) => {
     // Successfully pulled message history.
     console.log(res);
   })
   .catch((e) => {
     // Failed to pull.
   });
```

### Pin a conversation

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```javascript
connection.pinConversation({conversationId:'conversationId', conversationType: 'singleChat', isPinned: true})
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```javascript
// pageSize: The number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50]。
// cursor：The cursor position to start getting data. If an empty string ('') is passed, the SDK will start querying from the latest pinned session.
connection.getServerPinnedConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''})
```

### Pin a message

You can call `pinMessage` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `PinnedMessageInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Message ID.
   messageId: 'messageId'
}

conn.pinMessage(options).then(()=>{
   // Succeeded in pinning the message.
   console.log('Succeeded in pinning the message')
})

```

### Unpin a message

You can call `unpinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `onMessagePinEvent` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Message ID.
   messageId: 'messageId'
}

conn.unpinMessage(options).then(()=>{
   // Succeeded in unpinning the message.
   console.log('Succeeded in unpinning the message.')
})

```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `getServerPinnedMessages` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

```javascript
const options = {
   // Conversation ID.
   conversationId: 'conversationId',
   // Conversation type which is `groupChat` for group chat and `chatRoom` for chat room chat.
   conversationType: 'groupChat',
   // The number of pinned messages to retrieve per page. The value range is [1,50] and the default value is `10`
   pageSize: 20,
   // The cursor position that indicates where to start getting data.
   // Pass in an empty string ('') for the first call of the API and the SDK returns the pinned messages in the descending order of the pinning time.
   cursor: ''
}

conn.getServerPinnedMessages(options).then((res)=>{
   // Succeeded in retrieving the list of pinned messages in a conversation.
   console.log(res)
})
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `removeHistoryMessages` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 20 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```javascript
// Delete messages by timestamp
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', beforeTimeStamp: Date.now()})
// Delete messages by message ID
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', messageIds: ['messageId']})
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

You can use the `removeHistoryMessages` method to unidirectionally delete historical messages on the server based on time or message ID. Up to 20 messages can be deleted at once. After deletion, the account cannot retrieve the message from the server. Other users are not affected by this operation.

Upon successful deletion, the `deleteRoaming` callback will be triggered when logging in from multiple terminals and devices.

```javascript
// Delete messages by time stamp
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', beforeTimeStamp: Date.now()})

// Delete messages by message ID
connection.removeHistoryMessages({targetId: 'userId', chatType: 'singleChat', messageIds: ['messageId']})
```
### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `addConversationMark` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations. Each conversation can have up to 20 tags. This feature applies only to private chats and chat groups.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `getServerConversations` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `ConversationItem#marks` method.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations per user), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.addConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('addConversationMark success')
})
```

To create customized tags, you need to do the following:
  
  ```javascript
  const MarkMap = new Map();
  MarkMap.set(0, 'IMPORTANT');
  MarkMap.set(1, 'NORMAL');
  MarkMap.set(2, 'STAR');
  ```

### Remove conversation tag

To remove a conversation tag, call `removeConversationMark`. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side conversation tags.

```javascript
const options = {
  conversations: [
    {conversationId: 'test', conversationType: 'singleChat'},
    {conversationId: 'groupId', conversationType: 'groupChat'}
  ],
  mark: 0,
}

conn.removeConversationMark(options).then(() => {
  console.log('removeConversationMark success')
})
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `getServerConversationsByFilter` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```javascript
const options = {
  pageSize: 10,
  cursor: '',
  filter: {
    mark: 0
  }
}
conn.getServerConversationsByFilter().then((res) => {
  console.log('getServerConversationsByFilter success', res)
})
```
