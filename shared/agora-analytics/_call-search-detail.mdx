### Key events

For each user whose **View metrics** switch is turned on, this section shows their events during the selected time range in two views: Timeline and list.

**Timeline**

The circles on the timeline represent events. A larger circle means more events occurred at that time. If a noteworthy event occurred, the circle is marked red.

### Audio and video quality metrics

With the core audio and video metrics displayed in the sender’s and receiver’s view, this section shows the quality of experience within the selected time range for each user whose **View metrics** switch is turned on (referred to as "selected users").

The metrics are defined in [User-specific metrics](call-search-terms#user-content-user-specific-metrics).

**Sender’s view**

Click **Sender’s view**, and click **Audio** or **Video**. You can see the sending bitrates and upstream packet loss rates for all [senders](call-search-terms#user-content-senderhost) among the selected users.

Follow these steps to locate abnormal senders:

-   If an exclamation mark appears in the upper right corner, the user might encounter an issue that significantly affects the user experience. Click the exclamation mark to enter this user’s [Call diagnosis (Beta)](call-search#user-content-analyze-quality-issues) page.

**Receiver’s view**

Click **Receiver’s view**, and click **Audio** or **Video**. You can see the receiving bitrates and freeze time for all [receivers](call-search-terms#user-content-receiveraudience-member) among the selected users. If audio and video streams from multiple senders are received, they are marked in different colors on the line chart.

Follow these steps to locate abnormal receivers:

-   If the line chart has many red glitches, the receiver might experience significant freezing issues. In the upper right corner of the line chart, click **Inspect a remote client**, and select the corresponding sender’s user ID from the drop-down menu. You enter the [end-to-end details page](#_end_to_end_details_page) for further inspection.
