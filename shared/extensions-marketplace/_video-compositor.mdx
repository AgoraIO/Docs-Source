The <Vg k="RTEE_COMPOSITOR" /> extension for the Web SDK enables local users to seamlessly merge multiple video streams and images into a single video track. This feature allows for the simultaneous display of multiple video feeds in the same video container, making it ideal for applications such as online education, remote conferencing, and live broadcasts. With the <Vg k="RTEE_COMPOSITOR" /> extension, users can easily share and manage multiple video streams to implement features like picture-in-picture for a more engaging and dynamic viewing experience.

Try out the [online demo](https://webdemo-global.agora.io/example/plugin/videoCompositor/index.html) to experience the <Vg k="RTEE_COMPOSITOR" /> extension.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows how the <Vg k="RTEE_COMPOSITOR" /> extension creates a composite video track from multiple inputs:

![Video compositor extension technology](/images/extensions-marketplace/video-compositor-tech.png)

To share a composite video you implement the following steps:

1. Create a video input layer `IBaseProcessor` for each video track and an image input layer `HTMLImageElement` for each image.
1. Connect the pipeline between each video track and its corresponding input layer, injecting the video stream into the input layer. The compositor combines all input layers.
1. Connect the pipeline between the compositor and the local video track, then output the combined video to the SDK.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project using the Web SDK version 4.12.0 or later.
