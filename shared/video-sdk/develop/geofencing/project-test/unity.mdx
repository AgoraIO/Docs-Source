5. **Choose this sample in the reference app**

    From the main screen of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, choose **<Vpd k="NAME" />** from the dropdown and then select **Geofencing**.

1. **Join a channel**

    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
    Select an option and click **Join** to start a session. When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper notAllowed="interactive-live-streaming">
    Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.
    </ProductWrapper>

    Now, you can see yourself and remote user on the device screen. It means your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has made a connection with the specified region <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

1. **Try other <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> regions**

    ```csharp
    region = AREA_CODE.AREA_CODE_JP;
    ```
</PlatformWrapper>
