    **AirPods Pro Bluetooth connection issue**

    AirPods Pro does not support A2DP protocol in communication audio mode, which may lead to connection failure in that mode.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
Starting from v4.5.0, both <Vg k="VSDK" /> and <Vg k="SIG" /> SDK (v2.2.0 and above) include the `aosl.xcframework` library. If you manually integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> via CDN and also use Signaling SDK, delete the earlier version of the `aosl.xcframework` library to avoid conflicts.
