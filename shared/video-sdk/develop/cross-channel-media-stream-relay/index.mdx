Some special scenarios require cross-channel media stream forwarding functionality. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to relay the media stream of a host, from a source channel, to multiple target channels simultaneously. This functionality allows you to realize the following interactions:

- The hosts publish and receive each other's audio and video streams while engaging in *cross-channel* real-time interaction.

- The audience receive all audio and video streams from hosts and watch multiple hosts interact at the same time.

Due to its real-time and interactive nature, this feature enriches live broadcasts and game-play, It is especially suitable for live scenes such as co-hosting PK and online choir. It provides the audience with a better viewing experience, while bringing more traffic and revenue to the hosts.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
Cross-channel media stream relay is included in Agora's policy of [10,000 free minutes](../../help/account-and-billing/billing_free) every month. For usage beyond the free quota, please refer to [Pricing](../Overview/pricing).

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project. 
- Contact [technical support](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to activate the cross-channel media stream relay feature.

## Implement cross-channel media stream relay

### Development considerations
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
- In live broadcast scenarios, only users with the role of a host can call `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` to initiate cross-channel media stream forwarding.
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` must be called after successfully joining a channel, or it will result in an error.
- Within a single channel, multiple hosts can forward the media stream. A single host can forward the media stream to up to 6 target channels.
- This feature does not support String type `uid`. If you need to use the cross-channel co-hosting feature, you must also use Integer type `uid` in regular co-hosting; otherwise, the cross-channel co-hosting feature will not work properly.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- This feature supports forwarding media streams to up to 4 target channels. If you want to add or remove target channels during forwarding, call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method.
- This feature does not support String usernames.
- Multiple hosts within a channel can forward media streams. The SDK forwards the stream of the host who calls the `startChannelMediaRelay` method.
- When setting the source channel information using `setSrcChannelInfo`, ensure that the uid is different from the current host's uid. Best practice is to set this uid to `0`, allowing the server to randomly assign one.
- After successfully forwarding media streams by calling `startChannelMediaRelay` or `updateChannelMediaRelay`, users in the target channel receive the `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-published")` callback. During the media stream forwarding process, if a host in the target channel goes offline or leaves the channel, the host in the source channel receives the `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-left")` callback.
- After successfully calling `startChannelMediaRelay`, if you wish to call it again, you must first call `stopChannelMediaRelay` to exit the current forwarding state.
