### Remove a member from a chat room

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `removeChatRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from a chat room. Once removed from the chat room, this member receives the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onRemovedFromChatRoom` callback, while all the other members receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMemberExitedFromChatRoom` callback. Users can join the chat room again after being removed.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from a chat room:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.removeChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    members,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Retrieve the chat room member list

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomMembers` to retrieve the member list of the current chat room.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room member list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    pageSize: pageSize,
    cursor: cursor,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Manage the chat room block list

#### Add a member to the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `blockChatRoomMembers` to add the specified member to the chat room block list. Once added to the block list, this member receives the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onRemovedFromChatRoom` callback, while all the other members receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMemberExitedFromChatRoom` callback. After being added to block list, this user cannot send or receive messages in the chat room. They can no longer join the chat room again until they are removed from the block list.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room block list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.blockChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unBlockChatRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from the chat room block list.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from the chat room block list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.unBlockChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Retrieve the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `fetchChatRoomBlockList` to retrieve the chat room block list.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room block list:

```dart
try {
  List<String>? list= await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomBlockList(
    roomId,
    pageNum: pageNum,
    pageSize: pageSize,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Manage the chat room mute list

#### Add a member to the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `muteChatRoomMembers` to add the specified member to the chat room mute list. Once added to the mute list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMuteListAddedFromChatRoom` callback.

**Note**: The chat room owner can mute chat room admins and regular members, whereas chat room admins can only mute regular members.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room mute list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.muteChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unMuteChatRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from the chat room mute list. Once removed from the mute list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMuteListRemovedFromChatRoom` callback.

**Note**: The chat room owner can unmute chat room admins and regular members, whereas chat room admins can only unmute regular members.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from the chat room mute list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.unMuteChatRoomMembers(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Retrieve the chat room mute list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `fetchChatRoomMuteList` to retrieve the chat room mute list.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room mute list:

```dart
try {
  List<String>? list =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomMuteList(
    roomId,
    pageNum: pageNum,
    pageSize: pageSize,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Manage the chat room allow list

#### Add a member to the chat room allow list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `addMembersToChatRoomAllowList` to add the specified member to the chat room allow list. Members in the chat room allow list can send chat room messages even when the chat room owner or admin has muted all chat room members. However, if a member is already in the chat room mute list, adding this member to the allow list does not enable them to send messages. The mute list takes precedence. Once added to the allow list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAllowListAddedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room allow list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.addMembersToChatRoomAllowList(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Remove a member from the chat room allow list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `removeMembersFromChatRoomAllowList` to remove the specified member from the chat room allow list. Once removed from the chat room allow list, this member and all the other chat room admins or owner receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAllowListRemovedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from the chat room allow list:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.removeMembersFromChatRoomAllowList(
    roomId,
    members
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Check whether a user is added to the allow list

All chat room members can call `isMemberInChatRoomAllowList` to check whether they are added to the chat room allow list.

The following code sample shows how to check whether a user is on the chat room allow list:

```dart
try {
  bool isInAllowList = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.isMemberInChatRoomAllowList(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Mute and unmute all the chat room members

#### Mute all the chat room members

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `muteAllChatRoomMembers` to mute all the chat room members. Once all the members are muted, the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged` callback is triggered and only those in the chat room allow list can send messages in the chat room.

The following sample code shows how to mute all the chat room members:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.muteAllChatRoomMembers();
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Unmute all the chat room members

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `unMuteAllChatRoomMembers` to unmute all the chat room members. Once all the members are muted, the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged` callback is triggered.

The following sample code shows how to unmute all the chat room members:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.unMuteAllChatRoomMembers();
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Manage the chat room owner and admins

#### Transfer the chat room ownership

Only the chat room owner can call `changeOwner` to transfer the ownership to the specified chat room member. Once the ownership is transferred, the former chat room owner becomes a regular member. The new chat room owner and the chat room admins receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onOwnerChangedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to transfer the chat room ownership:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.changeOwner(
    roomId,
    newOwner,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Add a chat room admin

Only the chat room owner can call `addChatRoomAdmin` to add an admin. Once promoted to an admin, the new admin and the other chat room admins receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAdminAddedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to add a chat room admin:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.addChatRoomAdmin(
    roomId,
    memberId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Remove a chat room admin

Only the chat room owner can call `removeChatRoomAdmin` to remove an admin. Once demoted to a regular member, the former admin and the other chat room admins receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onAdminRemovedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to remove a chat room admin:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.removeChatRoomAdmin(
    roomId,
    adminId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```
