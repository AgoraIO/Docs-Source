3. **Configure the project**:

    In `src/agora_manager/config.json`, Replace:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `channelName` - with the name of a channel you want to join.
    * `token` - with a valid temporary token for the `channelName`.
    * `cloudProxy` - set it to `true`.

1.  **Run the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**:

      In Terminal, execute the following command:

      ```bash
      pnpm dev
      ```

      Use the URL displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> in your browser.

1. **Join a Channel**:

    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
      Select an option and click **Join** to start a session.
      - When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
      - When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
      Click **Join** to start a call. Now, you can see yourself on the device screen and talk to the remote user using your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
    </ProductWrapper>

6. Grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

    You see your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts the proxy service and magically connects to the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> which was not possible in a restricted  network environment.
