  Stop recording

When a recording finishes, call the `stop` method to leave the channel and stop recording. To use Agora Cloud Recording again, you need to call the  [`acquire`](../rest-api/acquire) method for a new resource ID.

- Method: POST
- Endpoint: /v1/apps/\<appid\>/cloud_recording/resourceid/\<resourceid\>/sid/\<sid\>/mode/\<mode\>/stop

> - The request frequency limit is 10 requests per second for each [Agora account](../manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account). Contact [Agora technical supoort](mailto:support@agora.io) if you need to raise the limit.
> - By default, Agora Cloud Recording automatically leaves the channel and stops recording if there are ever no users in the channel for more than 30 seconds.

## HTTP response

If the returned HTTP status code is `200`, it means the request was successful, and the response body contains the following fields:
- `code`: Number. [Status code](../common-errors#status-codes).
- `resourceId`: String. The resource ID for cloud recording. The resource ID is valid for five minutes.
- `sid`: String. The recording ID. The unique identification of the current recording.
- `serverResponse`: JSON. The details about the recording status. The child elements in `serverResponse` vary according to your configurations in [`start`](../rest-api/start). For example, if you configure `snapshotConfig` or `extensionServiceConfig` in `start`, then `stop` does not return `fileListMode`.
  - `fileListMode`: String. The data type of `fileList`.
    - `"string"`: `fileList` is a string. In composite mode, if you set `avFileType` as [`"hls"]`, `fileListMode` is `"string"`.
    - `"json"`: `fileList` is a JSONArray. In individual mode, or if you set `avFileType` as [`"hls","mp4"]` in composite recording mode, `fileListMode` is `"json"`.
  - `fileList`: When `fileListMode` is `"string"`, `fileList` is a string that represents the filename of the M3U8 file. When `fileListMode` is `"json"`, `fileList` is a JSONArray that contains the details of each recorded file.
