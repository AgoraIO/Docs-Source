| State          | Description       |
|:---------------|:------------------|
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateIdle`          | **Idle state**: The SDK enters this state when you create a client instance or after you explicitly call the `logout` method. In this state, the SDK does not attempt to establish or maintain a connection with the server. The SDK clears the session cache upon entering this state. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateConnecting`    | **Connecting state**: When you call the `loginByToken` method, the SDK immediately enters this state. It also enters this state during each reconnection attempt after the connection is accidentally disconnected. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateConnected`     | **Connected state**: In this state, the client and the server are connected normally; users can access all <Vg k="SIG" /> capabilities. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateDisconnected`  | **Disconnected state**: The connection is temporarily disconnected. The SDK enters this state after the connection is lost due to a temporary network failure, or after an unsuccessful reconnection attempt. In this state, the client attempts to restore the connection to the server after 2, 4, 8, ... seconds. If the connection is restored, the SDK restores the previous channel subscription and the user status. In this state, users cannot send or receive messages. This state lasts for up to 2 minutes and switches to `AgoraRtmLinkStateSuspended` if the connection cannot be restored within this time. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateSuspended`     | **Connection pending state**: This is a long-term disconnection state entered into due to no network connection or server unavailability. If the connection cannot be restored within 2 minutes, it enters a suspended state after attempts to restore the connection fail. In this state, the SDK periodically tries to restore the connection every 30 seconds. You can also call the `loginByToken` method to try to reconnect. Users cannot send or receive messages while in this state. If automatic reconnection is successful, the SDK automatically restores the channel subscriptions and the temporary user status. You can actively call the `logout` method to return to the `AgoraRtmLinkStateIdle` state. However, note that doing so clears the session cache, and the SDK no longer guarantees the continuity of channel subscriptions and restoration of the user status. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateFailed`        | **Failed state**: If the client encounters an unrecoverable failure, such as a fatal error due to an incorrect app ID or expired token, the client enters this state. In this state, the SDK does not attempt to reconnect, and the client is unable to send or receive messages. To attempt reconnection, call the `loginByToken` method again.                  |

The following figure shows possible transitions between message channel connection states:

#### Connection state transitions

The state of the connection between the SDK and the <Vg k="SIG" /> server undergoes several transitions during communication. The following figure illustrates the state transitions during some common message channel connection scenarios.

### Stream channel connection states

In a stream channel, you join a channel to initiate a connection with the server. In case of unexpected interruptions, the client automatically attempts reconnection for up to 20 minutes. If the attempts are unsuccessful, the stream channel connection state changes to failed, and the client ceases further reconnection attempts.

The table below provides an overview of the various stream channel connection states:

| State       | Description             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateIdle`        | **Idle state**: The SDK enters this state after you create a stream channel instance or after you explicitly call the `leave` method from any state. In this state, the SDK clears the session cache, closes the connection, and does not attempt to establish a connection to the server. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateConnecting`  | **Connecting state**: When you call the `joinWithOption` method, the stream channel enters this state immediately. It also enters this state during each reconnection attempt after the connection is accidentally disconnected. |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateConnected`   | **Connected state**:  In this state, the client and the server are connected normally; users can access all Signaling stream channel capabilities.  |
| `AgoraRtmLinkStateFailed`      | **Failed state**: If the SDK encounters an unrecoverable failure, such as a fatal error due to an incorrect app ID or expired token, it enters this state. In this state, the SDK does not attempt to reconnect, and the user is unable to send or receive messages. To attempt reconnection, call the `joinWithOption` method again. |

## Listen for connection state events

The `didReceiveLinkStateEvent` callback provides the information you need to understand network state transitions. 

```objc
@interface RtmListenerEx : NSObject <AgoraRtmClientDelegate>
@end

@implementation RtmListenerEx
- (void)rtmKit:(AgoraRtmClientKit *)rtmKit didReceiveLinkStateEvent:(AgoraRtmLinkStateEvent *)event {}
@end

RtmListenerEx* handlerEx =  [[RtmListenerEx alloc] init];

[rtm addDelegate:handlerEx];
```

The event provides the following parameters:

- `previousState`: The state from which the change occurred.
- `currentState`: The current state after the change.
- `serviceType`: The type of service for which the connection state has changed.
- `operation`: The operation responsible for the change.
- `reason`: The reason behind the change.

To remove the callback use:

```objc
[rtm removeDelegate:handlerEx];
```

## Connection restoration mechanism

After each `loginByToken` operation, the SDK attempts to establish a connection with the server and generates a local session cache. This cache records information regarding channels the user subscribes or joins, and the temporary user status data set in these channels. This includes both the message channel and the stream channel.

When the client experiences temporary disconnection due to a network issue, it automatically attempts to reconnect. Upon successful reconnection, the SDK utilizes the session cache to restore the user's channel subscription and temporary user status data, to ensure continuity of the session. Whether the client recovers from the `AgoraRtmLinkStateDisconnected` state or the `AgoraRtmLinkStateSuspended` state, continuity is automatically restored as long as the user does not actively call the `logout` method to log out. However, if the user initiates logout, the session cache is cleared, and the connection status returns to `AgoraRtmLinkStateIdle`. Upon a subsequent login, the user needs to resubscribe to channels and reset their temporary user statuses.

In the event of a sudden network disconnection, you can inspect the names of the affected channels by examining the `affectedChannels` field returned by the `didReceiveLinkStateEvent` event. The following example shows sample information contained in the `affectedChannels` field :

```json
"affectedChannels" : [
    "ChatRoom",
    "VirtualSpace"
]
```

## Handling connection errors

The <Vg k="SIG" /> client automatically recovers from non-fatal error states, and notifies you of the event details through an `didReceiveLinkStateEvent` callback. Handle these events according to your business needs to optimize the user experience.

### Fatal errors

Some errors are fatal. This means that the SDK is unable to recover automatically from these errors and thus enters the `AgoraRtmLinkStateFailed` state. In this state, the SDK does not attempt automatic reconnection. In such cases, troubleshoot potential errors independently and actively trigger reconnection by explicitly calling the `loginByToken` or `joinWithOption` method.

Following is a list of issues that may lead to fatal errors:

- An invalid or expired token.
- The user ID of the current user is banned.
- Signaling is not enabled for the current app ID or the app ID is invalid
- Edge server resources are unavailable.
- The `AgoraRtmServiceTypeMessage` service is not deployed in the current environment.
- Usage limit exceeded.
- A stream channel instance was not created.
- The channel name is illegal.

### Non-fatal errors

Some errors are non-fatal; for example, a client experiences a brief network outage while passing through an underground tunnel. In such cases, the SDK attempts automatic reconnection. If reconnection is successful, the previously subscribed channels and temporary user status are restored automatically. However, if the user chooses to log out during this process, the client cache is cleared. This means that the cached channel subscriptions and temporary user statuses are removed. In such cases, users must re-login, resubscribe to channels, and reset temporary user statuses to resume the previous status.
