This page provides descriptions and troubleshooting tips for common {data.VSDK} error and warning codes. If you receive a response that is not included here, best practiec is to contact support@agora.io so that our technical support team can help resolve the issue.

## Messages and codes

When you make an API call to access an {data.VSDK}, the SDK may return:

- *Error codes* - when a problem occurs that cannot be recovered without app intervention. Error code can be a negative. However, you should read it as a positive number. For example, if {data.VSDK} returns `-2`, refer to `2` in the error code table.
- *Warning codes* - when a problem that might be resolved automatically has occurred. Warning codes provide information but normally do not require any action.


## Native platforms and third-party frameworks

This section applies to the {data.COMPANY} {data.VSDK} designed for:

* Native platforms, such as Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
* Third-party frameworks (third-party platforms where native app code is wrapped), such as Electron, Unity, React Native, and Flutter.

The error and warning codes may be returned in the following ways:

* The return value of a method call, represented by a negative number. In such a case, it should be read as if it were positive.
* An `onError` or `onWarning` callback.

### General errors

Possible errors are:


|Error code |Cause and troubleshooting tips 
|---|---|
|`0` |No error occurs. |
|`1` |A general error occurs (no specified reason). Try calling the method again. |
|`2` |An invalid parameter is used. For example, the specified channel name includes illegal characters. Please reset |the parameters. 
|`3` a|The SDK is not ready due to one of the following reasons: <br/> `RtcEngine` fails to initialize. Please re-initialize `RtcEngine`. No user has joined the channel when the method is called. Please check your code logic. Users have not left the channel when the `rate` and `complain` methods are called. Please check your code logic.The audio module is disabled.The program is not complete.|
|`4` a|`RtcEngine` does not support the request due to one of the following reasons:<ul><li>The `setBeautyEffectOptions` method is called on devices running versions earlier than Android 4.4. Please check the Android version.</li><li>The built-in encryption mode is incorrect or the SDK fails to load the external encryption library. Please check the encryption mode setting or reload the external encryption library.</li></ul>|
|`5` a|The request is rejected due to one of the following reasons:<ul><li>`RtcEngine` fails to initialize. Please re-initialize `RtcEngine`.</li><li>The channel name is set as the empty string &quot;&quot; when creating the `RtcChannel` instance. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>When the `joinChannel` method is called to join one of multiple channels, the specified channel name is already in use. Please reset the channel name.</li><li>The `joinChannel` method in `RtcEngine` is called to join another channel after an `RtcChannel` instance has been created to join a channel and a stream has been published in the channel.</li><li>A user whose role is not audience calls the `switchChannel` method. Ensure that the user role is audience before calling the `switchChannel` method.</li></ul>|
|`6` |The buffer size is insufficient to store the returned data. |
|`7` |A method is called before the initialization of `RtcEngine`. Ensure that the `RtcEngine`instance is created and initialized before calling the method.|
|`9` |Permission to access is not granted. Check whether your app has access to the audio and video device. |
|`10`|A timeout occurs. Some API calls require the SDK to return the execution result. This error occurs if the SDK |takes too long (more than 10 seconds) to return the result.|
|`17`|The request to join the channel is rejected. Typical causes include:<ul><li>The user is already in the channel and still calls a method (for example, `joinChannel`) to join the channel. Stop calling the method to clear this error.</li><li>The user tries to join a channel during a call test. To join a channel, the call test must be ended by calling `stopEchoTest`.</li></ul>|
|`18`|The request to leave the channel is rejected. Typical causes include:<ul><li>The user has left the channel but still calls a method (for example, `leaveChannel`) to leave the channel. Stop calling the method to clear this error.</li><li>The user is not in the channel. In this case, no extra operation is needed.</li></ul>|
|`19` |Resources are already in use. |
|`20` |The request is abandoned by the SDK, possibly because the request has been sent too frequently. |
|`21` |`RtcEngine` fails to initialize and has crashed because of specific Windows firewall settings. |
|`22` |The SDK fails to allocate resources because your app uses too many system resources or system resources are insufficient.|
|`101` |The specified App ID is invalid. Please rejoin the channel with a valid App ID. |
|`102` |The specified channel name is invalid, possibly because the data types of some parameters are incorrect. Please |rejoin the channel with a valid channel name. 
|`103` |`RtcEngine` fails to get server resources in the specified region. Try another region when initializing `RtcEngine`.| 
|`109`|The current token has expired. Please apply for a new token on the server and call renewToken. <br/> **Note:** This method is *deprecated* as of v2.4.1. Please use `CONNECTION_CHANGED_TOKEN_EXPIRED(9)` in the`onConnectionStateChanged` callback instead.|
|`110`|The token is invalid due to one of the following reasons:<ul><li>App Certificate is enabled in {data.CONSOLE}, but the code still uses App ID for authentication. Once App Certificate is enabled for a project, you must use token-based authentication.</li><li>The uid used to generate the token is not the same as the one used to join the channel.</li></ul> <br />**Note:** This method is *deprecated* as of v2.4.1. Please use `CONNECTION_CHANGED_INVALID_TOKEN(8)`in the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback instead.|
|`111` |The network connection is interrupted. This error occurs when the SDK has connected to the server but lost connection for more than 4 seconds.| 
|`112` |The network connection is lost. This error occurs when the connection is interrupted and the SDK cannot |reconnect to the server within 10 seconds. 
|`113` |The user is not in the channel when calling the method. |
|`114` |The data size exceeds 1024 bytes when calling the `sendStreamMessage` method. |
|`115` |The data bitrate exceeds 6 Kbps when calling the `sendStreamMessage` method. |
|`116` |More than five data streams are created when calling the `createDataStream` method. |
|`117` |The data stream transmission times out. |
|`119` |Switching roles fails. |
|`120` |Decryption fails. The user may have entered an incorrect password to join the channel. Check the entered password or tell the user to try rejoining the channel. |
|`123` |The user is banned from the server. This error occurs when the user is kicked out of the channel from the server.| 
|`134` |The user account is invalid, possibly because it contains invalid parameters. |



### Watermark errors

Possible error codes are:

|Error code |Cause| 

|`124` |Incorrect watermark file parameter. |
