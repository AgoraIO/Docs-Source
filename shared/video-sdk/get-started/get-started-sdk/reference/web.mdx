### Channel modes

The <Vg k="VSDK"/> supports two channel modes: "rtc"(communication scenario) and "live"(live broadcast scenario).

**"rtc"(Communication scenario)**

It is suitable for scenarios where all users in the channel need to communicate with each other and the total number of users is not too large, such as multi-person conferences and online chats.

**"live"(Live broadcast scenario)**

It is suitable for scenarios where there are few publishers but many subscribers. In this scenario, the SDK defines two user roles: audience (default) and anchor. Anchors can send and receive audio and video, but viewers cannot send and can only receive audio and video. You can specify user roles by setting the parameters `createClient` of role, or you can call `setClientRole` to dynamically modify user roles.

### Video encoding formats

The `codec` parameter in the `createClient` parameter can be set to the following video encoding formats:

- `vp8` (VP8)
- `h264` (H.264)
- `vp9` (VP9)

This setting will only affect the video encoding format of the Host. For the audience, as long as it supports the decoding of this format, the subscription can be completed normally.

Different browsers and different devices have different support for these formats. The following table lists the `codec` formats supported by different browsers for reference:

| Browser             | vp8 | h264         | vp9               |
|:---------------------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| Desktop Chrome 58+ | ✔   | ✔             | ✔                 |
| Firefox 56+         | ✔   | ✔| ✔(Requires Firefox 69+) |
| Safari 12.1+        | ✔   | ✔             | ✔(Requires Safari 16+) |
| Safari < 12.1       | ✘   | ✔             | ✘                 |
| AndroidChrome 58+   | ✔   | No clear information | ✔(Requires Chrome 68+) |

<Admonition type="alert" info="Hint">
Firefox's `h264` support depends on the `OpenH264` Video Codec plug-in from Cisco Systems, Inc. Chrome's support for `h264` on Android devices varies based on device hardware compatibility with hardware codecs mandated by Chrome.

### Local media tracks

The SDK uses a system where all local track objects are based on a basic template called `LocalTrack`. Think of it like a blueprint that sets the rules for how all local tracks should behave.

When you want to send out a local track, you just need to use the `publish` method. It's pretty flexible because it only asks for a `LocalTrack` object as input. So, no matter how you create your local track, it'll work with this method.

Now, breaking it down further, we have two main types of local tracks: `LocalAudioTrack` and `LocalVideoTrack`. These cover the audio and video parts separately. Each type comes with its own set of tools. For example, `LocalAudioTrack` lets you control the volume, while `LocalVideoTrack` has functions for things like enhancing your appearance on video.

And for different situations and ways of creating tracks, the SDK gives us even more specific classes based on `LocalAudioTrack` and `LocalVideoTrack`. Take `CameraVideoTrack`, for instance. It's a type of `LocalVideoTrack` that represents video from your camera. So, it comes with extra features like controlling the camera and adjusting video quality.

Here's a simple diagram to show how these classes relate to each other:

### Other integration methods

Using `npm` to integrate the Web SDK also supports turning on Tree shaking to reduce the size of the app after integrating the SDK. For details, see [Using Tree shaking](.).

In addition to using `npm` to obtain the Web SDK, you can also use the following methods to integrate the SDK:

* In the project HTML file, add the following code to obtain the SDK using the CDN method:

    ```html
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTC_N-4.22.0.js"></script>
    ```

* Download the <Vpd k="SDK"/> package locally, save the `.js` files in the SDK package to the project directory, and then add the following code to the project HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="./AgoraRTC_N-4.22.0.js"></script>
    ```

### Frequently asked questions

**Why do I get a `digital envelope routines::unsupported` error when running the quickstart project locally?**

This issue arises because the quickstart project, which is configured with `webpack` for local execution, is affected by changes in Node.js 16 and above. The modifications in Node.js, particularly in its dependency on OpenSSL (detailed in the [node issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29817)), impact the local development environment dependencies of the project (refer to the [webpack issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532) for specifics). 

Use one of the following solutions to resolve the issue:

* Run the following command to set a temporary environment variable (Recommended):

    ```shell
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
    ```

* Temporarily switch to a lower version of Node.js.
