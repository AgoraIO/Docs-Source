With increasingly strict rules and regulations on app compliance, content supervision has become a crucial part of the app lifecycle. To meet this need, Chat provides the global-mute feature, which enables you to mute any user ID in one-to-one chats, <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s, or <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s, preventing these users from sending messages to other chat users, <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s, or <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s. When global-mute expires, the chat server automatically unmutes the user ID, and this user resumes the privilege of sending messages.

This feature can be widely applied in apps that power real-time engagements. For example, if a user frequently sends illegitimate advertisements to multiple <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s, you can use global-mute to prevent this user from sending <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> messages for 15 days; if a user makes improper statements concerning politics, global-mute can permanently prevent this user from sending any messages in one-to-one chats, <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s, or <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s.

Before calling the following methods, make sure you understand the call frequency limit of the Chat RESTful APIs as described in <Link to="../reference/limitations#call-limit-of-server-sides">Limitations</Link>.
