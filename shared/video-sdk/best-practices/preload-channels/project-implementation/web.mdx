Follow these steps to implement channel preloading:

### Preload channel list

    On the channel list page, preload the channels within the user's view area with the `preload` method.

        - If the total number of channels does not exceed 10, preload all channels.
        - If the total number of channels exceeds 10, preload only the first 10 channels. If the user scrolls the channel list, wait for the scrolling to stop, then preload the new channels in the user's view area.

    To speed up the subsequent joining of the channel, use a [wildcard token](../token-authentication/authentication-workflow#generate-wildcard-tokens) in the `token` parameter of the `preload` method.

### Preload individual channels

    Implement preloading for different mouse interactions:

    - Before entering the channel

        When a user hovers over a channel, best practice is to join the channel and subscribe to audio and video before entering. The specific operations include the following:

        - Call `join` to join the channel and subscribe to the host's audio and video streams.
        - Render the video in advance in a small preview window.

        To speed up joining the channel, use a [wildcard token](../token-authentication/authentication-workflow#generate-wildcard-tokens) in the `token` parameter of the `join` method.

    - Entering the channel

        In order to reduce the time it takes to render the first frame of the host's video, enable sending the host's media stream as soon as the user enters the channel. To use this function, [contact technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). The following table compares the steps from when a user enters the channel to when the host's media stream is rendered, before and after enabling this function:

        | Before | After |
        |---|---|
        |<ol><li>The user joins the channel.</li><li>The channel sends the host/media information.</li><li>The user subscribes to the media stream in the channel.</li><li>The Agora backend starts sending the media stream in the channel.</li><li>The user waits for the Agora backend to send the media stream, receives it, and renders it locally.</li></ol>|<ol><li>The user joins the channel.</li><li>The Agora backend immediately sends the media stream in the channel.</li><li>The channel sends the host/media information.</li><li>After the user subscribes to the media stream, they can immediately receive and render the media stream locally.</li></ol>|

        Joining a channel incurs additional fees due to the transmission of media streams. See [Pricing](../overview/pricing#cost-calculation) for details.

        When a user clicks on the channel in the list, take the following actions:

            - Switch the app interface from the channel list page to the single channel page. Best practice is to add a page switching animation.
            - Call `IRemoteAudioTrack.play` and `IRemoteVideoTrack.play`. The video needs to be passed in the specified DOM element.

    - Leaving without entering

        When a user hovers over a channel but does not click to enter, best practice is to call `leave`.

### Precautions

- Wildcard tokens can speed up the process of joining a channel but may cause room overflow. Decide whether to use wildcard tokens based on your specific needs.
- Preloading channels incurs additional charges.
