### Authenticate users with the <Vg k="VSDK" /> token

To enhance communication security, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends that you authenticate app users with the <Vg k="VSDK" /> token before they join a call. To do this, you need to make sure that the [Primary Certificate of your project is enabled](../reference/manage-agora-account#enable-the-primary-certificate).


Tokens are generated on your app server using the token generator provided by <Vg k="COMPANY"/>. After you retrieve the token, pass the token to the callkit when calling `startCall` and `answerCall`. For how to generate a token on the server and retrieve and renew the token on the client, see  [Secure authentication with tokens](/agora-chat/develop/authentication).
