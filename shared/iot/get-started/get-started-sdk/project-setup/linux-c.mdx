<PlatformWrapper platform="linux-c">
Take the following steps to set up the <Vpd k="SDK"/> sample project:

1. Install the `build-essential` package.

    If you don't have development tools installed on your machine, execute the following command in the terminal to install the `build-essential` package which contains `libc`, `gcc`, `g++`, and other development tools.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
    ```
1. Ensure `cmake`  v3.6.0 or above is installed.

    The sample project uses `cmake` to control the compilation process. Execute `cmake --version` to check that the version number is `3.6.0` or above. If the version number is lower, remove `cmake` by executing the command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt remove cmake
    ```
        
    To install the latest version of `cmake`, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install cmake
    ```

1. [Download](../../sdks?platform=linux) the appropriate SDK package.

    <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides several SDK packages configured for various architectures, operating systems, C libraries, and compilation options. The SDK package name indicates the intended platform and compilation options. For example, the name `armv7a-linux-uclibceabi` means that the SDK package is configured for the `armv7a` architecture and the Linux operating system. The compilation tool chain uses `uClibc`, and the compilation option is soft floating point. 
    
    For the purpose of this document, we use the `x86_64-linux-gnu` SDK package. You may choose the package that best matches your development environment and make appropriate modifications where required.

1. Extract the package

    Extract the downloaded SDK package into `<extracted-folder>` on your development machine.
