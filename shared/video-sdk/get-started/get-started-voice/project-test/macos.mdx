Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In your code update the `appId` and `token`, with the app ID and temporary token you obtained from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channelName` you filled in when generating the temporary token.

1. Click **Build** to run your project and wait a few seconds for the app installation to complete.

1. Allow the app to access the device's microphone.

1. On a second <Vpl k="NAME" /> device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel and test audio communication.
