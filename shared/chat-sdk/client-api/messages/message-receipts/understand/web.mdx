The message delivery receipts and read receipts are implemented as follows:

- Message delivery receipt for one-to-one chats

  1. The message sender enables delivery receipts by setting `delivery` as `true` when creating the `connection` object during SDK initialization.
  2. A user sends a message.
  3. After the recipient receives the message, the SDK automatically sends a delivery receipt to the sender.
  4. The sender receives the delivery receipt by listening for `onDeliveredMessage`.

- Conversation and message read receipts for one-to-one chats

  1. A user sends a message.
  2. After reading the message, the recipient calls `send` to send a conversation or message read receipt.
  3. The sender receives the conversation or message receipt by listening for `onChannelMessage` or `onReadMessage`.

- Message read receipt for group chats

  1. A group member sends a message with `allowGroupAck` set to `true` to request message read receipts.
  2. After reading the message, the recipient calls `send` to send a read receipt.
  3. The sender receives the message read receipt by listening for `onReadMessage` when online or `onStatisticsMessage` when offline.
  4. The sender can know which group members have read the message by calling `getGroupMsgReadUser`.
