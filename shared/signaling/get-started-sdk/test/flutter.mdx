Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Use the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/) to generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

    1. Select Signaling from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
    1. Fill in your app ID and app certificate from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
    1. Click **Generate Token**.

1. In your code, replace `your_appId` with your app ID  from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, `your_userId` with a numeric string and `your_token` with the generated token.

1. Save the project.

1. Connect the target device to your computer, or open the device emulator.

1. In the terminal, execute the following command in the project path to run the sample project on the target device:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    You see the following output in the terminal:

    ```
    flutter: publish success! message number:0
    flutter: publish success! message number:1
    flutter: publish success! message number:2
    flutter: publish success! message number:3
    ```

1. Run a second instance of the project on another device or emulator using a different `userId`.

    You see the following notifications for messages sent from the first <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance:

    ```
    flutter: received a message from channel: getting-started, channel type : RtmChannelType.message
    flutter: message content: message number : 0, custom type: PlainText
    flutter: received a message from channel: getting-started, channel type : RtmChannelType.message
    flutter: message content: message number : 1, custom type: PlainText
    ```
