<Introduction />

This page shows you how to use <Vpd k="SDK"/> features to account for these factors and ensure optimal audio and video quality in your <Vpd k="NAME" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

To provide the best audio and video quality in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>:

- **Choose an audio codec to optimize bit rate and quality**

  In audio and video streaming, the choice of an encoding algorithm affects both quality and bit rate. Your goal is to lower the required bit rate while maintaining quality at the desired level. <Vpd k="SDK" /> offers the following built-in audio codecs:

  - Opus
  - G722
  - G711A (PCMU) 
  - G711U (PCMU) 

  You specify an audio codec when you join a channel. Depending on your audio quality requirements you also set the sampling rate and the number of channels. If your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> needs a custom encoding algorithm, you disable use of a built-in codec and implement your own encoder. 

- **Adjust sending bit rate in real time**

  In order to optimize data transmission and avoid network congestion, best practice is to adjust the sending bit rate in real-time according to changes in network conditions.

  You configure BandWidth Estimation (BWE) before joining a channel to set the minimum, maximum, and starting bit rate values according to the actual bandwidth and bit rate needs. When the network bandwidth changes, <Vpd k="SDK"/> triggers an event to prompt your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> to adjust the sending bit rate in real time. The bit rate returned by the callback is the maximum recommended encoding bit rate of the video encoder.

- **Change audio and video streaming status**

  Network traffic can be reduced by suspending data transmission when audio or video feed is not required by the receiver. After a user successfully connects to a channel and starts audio and video streaming, they can suspend sending streams to a specific connection or to all connections to flexibly manage the transmission status of audio and video streams. Similarly, the user may suspend receiving a specific or all streams as required.

  When a user changes the transmission status of the local audio or video stream, the <Vpd k="SDK"/> triggers a corresponding callback to prompt the remote user to suspend or resume sending their audio or video stream.

- **Request key frames**

  In video transmission, a frame containing complete image information is known as a key frame. Subsequent frames, known as delta frames, only include modifications to the previous frame. When a video streaming client experiences network congestion, the data loss in delta frames leads to visual inconsistencies in subsequent frames. <Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to request a key frame from the sender to resolve such issues. A fresh key frame resets the video stream to a known state. This feature allows the client to resynchronize with the video stream and resume playback without visual artifacts or distortion.

- **Log files** 

  <Vpd k="SDK"/> provides configuration options that you use to customize the location, content and size of log files containing key data of <Vpd k="SDK"/> operation. When you set up logging, <Vpd k="SDK"/> writes information messages, warnings, and errors regarding activities such as initialization, configuration, connection and disconnection to log files. Log files are useful in detecting and resolving channel quality issues.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to ensure channel quality in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

* Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to implement channel quality best practices into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) for <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement best practice to optimize channel quality

This section shows you how to integrate channel quality optimization features of <Vpd k="SDK" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented channel quality features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="https://webdemo.agora.io/basicMute/index.html"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> Muting web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

<ProjectTest />

### Recommended sampling rates and data sizes for audio

The table below shows the recommended sampling rates and corresponding data sizes for Opus, G722, and G711 audio data.

| Audio format | Sampling rate (Hz) | Audio data size (Byte) |
|------|------|-------|
| G711 | 8000 | 320 |
| G722 | 16000 | 640 |
| OPUS | 16000 | 640 |
| OPUS | 48000 | 1920 |

### Definition levels of a webcam

| Gear	| Resolution	| Frame rate	| Bit rate range (kbps) | 
|:---:|:---|:-:|:---:|
| SD	| L1: 640*360	| 15 | 400 - 800 |
| HD	| L2: 1280*720	| 15	| 1130 - 2260 | 
| Ultra HD	| L3: 1920*1080	| 15	| 1130 - 4160 |
