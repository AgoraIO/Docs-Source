### Implement a custom video source

In the following code example, you create the basic framework required to push video frames from a custom source. Depending on the type of the source, you add your own code to this framework that converts the source data to `VideoFrame` data. To create the basic framework, take the following steps:

1. **Add a raw video file to the project**

    In this example, you use a video file as the source of your custom video data. Download a sample video file in `*.mp4` format, open it in Finder, and drag it on to your Xcode project.

1. **Enable publishing the custom video**

    When a user presses **Join**, you set the external video source to `true` before joining a channel. To do this, add the following line to the `joinChannel()` method in the `ViewController` class after `option.channelProfile = .of((Int32)(AgoraChannelProfile.communication.rawValue))`:

    ```swift
    agoraEngine.setExternalVideoSource(true, useTexture: true, sourceType: AgoraExternalVideoSourceType(rawValue: 1)!)
    ```

1. **Setup a video renderer for custom video**

    <Vg k="VSDK" /> does not support rendering video frames captured in the push mode. You need to implement a custom video renderer using methods from outside the SDK.

    ```swift
    // Initializes localVideo
    var localVideo = CustomVideoSourcePreview(frame: CGRect.zero)

    // Defines the CustomVideoSourcePreview class
    class CustomVideoSourcePreview : UIView {

        private var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
        func insertCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer) {
            self.previewLayer?.removeFromSuperlayer()

            previewLayer.frame = bounds
            layer.insertSublayer(previewLayer, below: layer.sublayers?.first)
            self.previewLayer = previewLayer
        }

        override func layoutSublayers(of layer: CALayer) {
            super.layoutSublayers(of: layer)
            previewLayer?.frame = bounds
        }
    }
    ```

1. **Push the video frames**

    To play the custom video when a user joins the channel, you open the video file when the user clicks **Join**. You add your custom logic to process the data into a `VideoFrame`, and push the `VIdeoFrame` to the channel. To do this, add the following lines after `joined = true` in the `joinChannel()` method:

    ```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "<videofile-name>", withExtension: "<extension>")
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf:url!) else { return }

    // Add code here to convert `Data` to VideoFrame object
    // ...

    agoraEngine.pushExternalVideoFrame(AgoraVideoFrame()) // replace AgoraVideoFrame() with your processed VideoFrame object
    ```

### Implement a custom audio source

To push audio from a custom source to a channel, do the following:

1. **Define variables to manage and push the audio stream**

    In `ViewController.swift`, add the following declarations to the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    // Audio file parameters
    var SAMPLE_RATE: Int = 44100
    var NUM_OF_CHANNELS: Int = 1
    ```

1. **Add a raw audio file to the project**

    In this example, you use an audio file as the source of your custom audio data. Download a sample audio file in `*.wav` format, open it in Finder, and drag it to your Xcode project.

1. **Enable publishing the custom audio track**

    When a user presses **Join**, you set the `ChannelMediaOptions` to disable the microphone audio track and enable the custom audio track. You also enable custom audio local playback and set the external audio source. To do this, add the following lines to the `joinChannel()` method in the `ViewController` class after the `if self.userRole == .broadcaster {` block:

    ```swift
    option.channelProfile = .of((Int32)(AgoraChannelProfile.communication.rawValue))
    option.publishCameraTrack = .of(false)
    option.publishAudioTrack = .of(false)
    option.publishCustomAudioTrack = .of(true)
    agoraEngine.setExternalAudioSource(true, sampleRate: SAMPLE_RATE, channels: NUM_OF_CHANNELS, sourceNumber: 1, localPlayback: true, publish: true)
    ```

1. **Open the audio file**

    To play the audio file when a user joins the channel,you open the audio file and start pushing the data to the SDK When the user clicks **Join**. To do this, add the following lines after `joined = true` in the `joinChannel()` method:

    ```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "<audio-filename-without-extension>", withExtension: "<extension>")
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf:url!) else { return }
    agoraEngine.pushExternalAudioFrameNSData(data, sourceId: 0, timestamp: 0)
    ```

    Replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` and `<extension>` with appropriate values. For example, for a file named `audio.wav` replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` with `audio` and `<extension>` with `wav`.
