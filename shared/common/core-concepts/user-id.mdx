### User ID

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="signaling">

In <Vpd k="NAME" />, the UID is an integer value that uniquely identifies a user within the context of a channel. When joining a channel, you have the option to either assign a specific UID to the user or pass `0` or `null` and allow <Vg k="COMPANY" /> to automatically generate and assign a UID to the user. If two users attempt to join the same channel with the same UID, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

The UID is used by <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s services and components to identify and manage users within a channel. Ensure that UIDs are properly assigned to prevent conflicts.

In <Vpd k="NAME" />, UID is a unique string identifier required along with an App ID to initialize the SDK. It is used to identify the user when logging in to <Vg k="MESS" /> and throughout their session for billing and online status notifications. Users can join channels by providing just the channel name, as the UID is already associated with the user during initialization.

Users cannot simultaneously log in to <Vg k="MESS" /> using the same UID from multiple devices. If a client attempts to log in to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> with a UID already present in the channel, the previously logged in client is disconnected and sent an event notification.
