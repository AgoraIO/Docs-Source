You use <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You can also use <Vg k="SIG" /> to
enhance the user experience for <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" />.

This page shows you how to easily integrate pub-sub messaging into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg
k="MESS_SDK" />. For information about stream channels where users communicate using topics in a channel, see [Stream
channels](/en/signaling/develop/stream-channel).

## Understand the tech

Pub-sub is the simplest form of messaging. <Vg k="SIG" /> creates a channel when a user subscribes to it. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for events which contain messages users publish to a channel.

You use an authentication token to authenticate a user with <Vg k="SIG" /> and join a channel. Each token is bound to a single user UID. This means that only one concurrent user may login from an instance of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

To create a pub-sub session for <Vg k="MESS" /> , implement the following steps in your
<Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from a [Token Generator](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/). To understand how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must:

<Prerequites />

- [Raise a support ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to activate <Vg k="MESS" />. In your ticket, please provide the following details:
    - Your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Customer Id
    - The project VID for which you want Signaling enabled
    - The App Id for the project in which you want to integrate Signaling
    - Do you require Stream Channel activation: Yes or No
    - Do you need data storage (Storing user and channel attributes as metadata): Yes or No
    - Your geographical region for product activation: US, EU, APAC (excluding China), or China                                                                                           
    
    The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> support team confirms activation through a ticket update.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note"><ul><li>Signaling 2.x is an enhanced version compared to 1.x with a wide range of new features. It follows a new pricing structure. Please visit the [Pricing](../reference/pricing) page for details. </li> <li>The beta version of Signaling 2.x is offered free of charge for testing its features and performance for the duration of its public beta. </li></ul></Admonition>

## Project setup

<Setup />

## Implement <Vg k="MESS" />

Best practice is to separate the <Vg k="MESS" /> workflows from your UI implementation. The <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> sample
project implements the <Vg k="MESS" />  business logic in the `SignalingManager` object. This class encapsulates the
`signalingEngine`, an instance of the`AgoraRTM`, and core functionality such as logging in to <Vg k="MESS"
/>, sending a message, listening for messages from other users and logging out.

The following code examples show how to implement these steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<Implement />

## Test <Vg k="MESS" />

This section explains how to run the reference app and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
