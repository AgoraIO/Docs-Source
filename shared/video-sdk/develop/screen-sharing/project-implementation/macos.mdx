</details>

Depending on your business use-case, you can choose either of the following methods to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />:

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` before joining the channel, then call `joinChannelByToken[2/4]` to join the channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

- Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` after joining the channel, then call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` to **true** to start <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.

The flow diagram and implementation steps in this article demonstrate the first use-case.

### Get resource list

Call `getScreenCaptureSourcesWithThumbSize` to get an object list of screens and windows that can be shared. The list contains important information such as **window ID** and **screen ID**. This enables users to choose a certain screen or a window, through the thumbnails in the list, for sharing. 

``` swift
// Get available screen information
@IBAction func onScreentThumbnailButton(_ sender: NSButton) {
    let result = agoraKit.getScreenCaptureSources(withThumbSize: NSScreen.main?.frame.size ?? .zero, iconSize: .zero, includeScreen: true)
    saveThumbnailToDesktop(result: result, type: .screen)
}

// Get information about available windows
@IBAction func onWindowThumbnailButton(_ sender: NSButton) {
    let result = agoraKit.getScreenCaptureSources(withThumbSize: selectedResolution?.size() ?? .zero, iconSize: .zero, includeScreen: true)
    saveThumbnailToDesktop(result: result, type: .window)
}
```

### Enable screen capture

Depending on the actual application use-case, choose one of the following three <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> methods.

#### Share the entire screen

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` with the following parameters to start sharing the whole screen:

- Set `displayId` to the `sourceId` (screen ID) obtained in the previous step.
- Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
    - In document scenes or remote control scenes, best practice is to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 FPS**.
    - In game scenes or video scenes, best practice is to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 FPS**.

``` swift
// Start sharing the specified screen
let result = agoraKit.startScreenCapture(byDisplayId: UInt32(screen.id), regionRect: .zero, captureParams: params)
```

#### Share app window

Call `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` with the following parameters to start sharing an entire app window:

- Set `windowId` to the `sourceId` (window ID) obtained in the previous step.
- Set your desired video encoding properties in `captureParams`:
    - In document scenes or remote control scenes, best practice is to set `dimensions` to **1920 × 1080** and `frameRate` as **10 FPS**.
    - In game scenes or video scenes, best practice is to set `dimensions` to **960 × 720** and `frameRate` to **15 FPS**.

``` swift
// Start sharing a specified app window
let result = agoraKit.startScreenCapture(byWindowId: UInt32(window.id), regionRect: .zero, captureParams: params)
```

#### Share a designated area

Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` method to start sharing, and set `regionRect` to the position of the area you want to share relative to the whole screen or window. The sample code is as follows:

``` swift
// Set the parameters of the area you want to share
// The next line of code specifies a rectangle with a length and width of 100px and an x-coordinate and y-coordinate of 0 in the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
let captureRect = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)
let result = agoraKit.startScreenCapture(byWindowId: UInt32(window.id), regionRect: captureRect, captureParams: params)
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">If the sharing area is set to extend beyond the boundaries of the screen, only the content within the screen is shared. If the width or height is set to 0, the entire screen is shared.</Admonition>

### Set up a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario 

Call the `setScreenCaptureScenario` method to set the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> scenario. Set the `scenarioType` to any one of the following according to your usage scenario:

- `AgoraScreenScenarioDocument`: Document scenario
- `AgoraScreenScenarioGaming`: Game scenario
- `AgoraScreenScenarioVideo`: Video scenario
- `AgoraScreenScenarioRDC`: Remote control scenario

The sample code is as follows:

``` swift
agoraKit.setScreenCaptureScenario(.video)
```

### Capture system audio (Optional)

To capture and publish the audio played in the shared screen or window simultaneously, call `enableLoopbackRecording` to start sound card capture.

After you call this method, the audio played by other processes in the system is published to the remote end. To turn off sound card acquisition, call the method again.

### Join a channel and publish a <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream

Call `joinChannelByToken`[2/4] to join the channel and set the channel media options.

``` swift
// Set the channel profile
agoraKit.setChannelProfile(.liveBroadcasting)
// Set the user role
agoraKit.setClientRole(.broadcaster)
// Set channel media options
// Publish screen capture video in the channel
// To publish a second screen capture video in the channel, replace the next line of code with the following: mediaOptions.publishSecondaryScreenTrack = true
mediaOptions.publishScreenTrack = true
// Join the channel
let result = self.agoraKit.joinChannel(byToken: token, channelId: channel, uid: 0, mediaOptions: option)
```

#### Additional notes

This example demonstrates publishing the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream directly in the channel without publishing the stream captured by the camera. In a real-world scenario, the requirements may be different. Adjust the code logic based on your scenario.

To publish the stream captured by the camera and the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream at the same time, refer to the following steps:

- Call `joinChannelByToken`[2/4] to join the first channel and publish the video stream recorded by the camera in that channel.
- Call `joinChannelEx` to join a second channel in which to publish the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> stream.

### Update <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters

To dynamically update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> area or parameters in the channel, call the following methods:

- To update the shared region of the screen, call the `updateScreenCaptureRegion` method to reset the `regionRect` parameter and define a new sharing area.

- To update the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters, such as video encoding resolution, frame rate, or bitrate, to stroke the screen or app window, or to block a specified window, call the `updateScreenCaptureParameters` method and update the `captureParams` parameter configuration.

``` swift
// Update screen sharing area
let region = NSMakeRect(0, 0, !toggleRegionalScreening ? rect!.width/2 : rect!.width, !toggleRegionalScreening ? rect!.height/2 : rect!.height)
agoraKit.updateScreenCaptureRegion(region)
// Update screen sharing parameters
agoraKit.updateScreenCaptureParameters(capParam)
```

### Stroke the screen

Depending on your scenario, you may stroke the shared screen or window in one of the following ways:

- Stroke when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` or `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`, set `highLighted` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both `highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.

- Stroke after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `highLighted` in `captureParams` to `true`, and set both `highLightColor` and `highLightWidth` to specify the stroke color and width.

``` swift
let params = AgoraScreenCaptureParameters()
params.frameRate = FPS
params.dimensions = resolution.size()
// Set the stroke width of the screen
params.highLightWidth = 5
// Set the stroke color of the screen
params.highLightColor = .green
// Enable screen stroke
params.highLighted = true
let result = agoraKit.startScreenCapture(byDisplayId: UInt32(screen.id), regionRect: .zero, captureParams: params)
```

### Block windows

Depending on your usage scenario, you may block a specified window in one of the following ways:

- Block windows when enabling <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />: Call `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.

- Block windows after <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> is enabled: Call `updateScreenCaptureParameters`, set `excludeWindowList` in `captureParams` to the list of windows you want to block.

``` swift
let captureParams = AgoraScreenCaptureParameters()
captureParams.excludeWindowList = windowlist.filter({ $0.id != window.id })
agoraKit.updateScreenCaptureParameters(captureParams)
```

### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Call `stopScreenCapture` to stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> within a channel. 

``` swift
// Stop screen sharing
agoraKit.stopScreenCapture()
```

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- After turning on <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the resolution of the <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> video stream as the billing standard. Please see the billing instructions for details. The default resolution is **1280 × 720**, but you can adjust it according to your business needs.
- To share 4K resolution Ultra-HD video during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, your device needs to meet certain requirements. The minimum device specifications recommended by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> are: 2021 M1 MacBook Pro 16-inch.
