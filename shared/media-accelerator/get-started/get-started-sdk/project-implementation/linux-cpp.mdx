<PlatformWrapper platform="linux-cpp">
Agora provides several SDK packages configured for various architectures, operating systems, C libraries, and compilation options. The SDK package name indicates the intended platform and compilation options. For example, `armv7a-linux-uclibceabi` indicates that the SDK supports armv7 architecture and the Linux operating system. The compilation tool chain uses `uClibc`, and the compilation option is soft floating point. For the purpose of this document, we will use the `x86_64-linux-gnu` SDK package. You may choose the package that matches your development environment and make appropriate modifications where required.

1. [Download](../../sdks) the SDK package

2. Extract the package

    Extract the SDK package into a folder on your development machine.

3. Navigate to the example folder.

    Execute the following command in the terminal. Make sure you replace `<extracted-folder>` with the path to the folder where the SDK package was extracted.
    
    ```bash
    cd <extracted-folder>/agora_rtsa_sdk/example
    ```

3. 

    ```bash
    ./build-x86_64.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    cd out/x86_64
    ./hello_rtsa --app-id 9d2498880e934632b38b0a68fa2f1622 --channel-id demo --token <token>
    ```
