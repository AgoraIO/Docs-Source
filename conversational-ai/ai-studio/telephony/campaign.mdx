  Create and manage outbound calling campaigns with your deployed agents.
---

Campaigns enable your deployed agents to make outbound calls to a list of contacts. You can use campaigns for sales outreach, customer follow-ups, appointment reminders, surveys, and other automated calling scenarios.

## How campaigns work

When you create a campaign, you select a deployed agent and provide a contact list. The agent calls each contact in the list using the imported phone number you specify as the caller ID. You can include custom variables in your contact list. The agent references these variables during conversations through the LLM's system prompts and greeting messages.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a campaign, ensure you have:

- An [imported phone number](/conversational-ai/ai-studio/telephony/import) to use as caller ID
- A [deployed agent](../deploy-agent) configured for your use case
- A contact list in CSV [format](#contact-list-format) with required phone numbers

## Create a campaign

To create a new campaign:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Campaigns** from the sidebar.

   ![Create a campaign](/images/conversational-ai/studio/campaign.png)

1. Click the **Create Campaign** button.

   ![New campaign](/images/conversational-ai/studio/new-campaign.png)

1. Upload your contact list (see [Contact list format](#contact-list-format) for requirements).

1. Configure the campaign settings:

   - **Campaign Name**: Enter a descriptive name to identify this campaign
   - **Phone Number**: Select the imported phone number to use as the outbound caller ID
   - **AI Agent**: Select the deployed agent that will handle the calls

1. Configure campaign timing:
   - **Launch Campaign Now**: Start calling contacts immediately after creation
   - **Schedule for Later**: Set a specific date and time to begin the campaign

1. Configure call Settings:

    ![Call Settings](/images/conversational-ai/studio/new-campaign-2.png)

    - **Hang-up Configuration**

      - **End of conversation**: Hang up when conversation naturally ends
      - **Voicemail Detection**: Allows agent to detect voicemail systems and hang up call
      - **Silence hangup**: End call after a period of silence
      - **Silence Timeout** (seconds): Duration of silence before ending the call. Call ends after the specified seconds of no response. Default: 120 seconds
      - **Max Call Duration** (seconds): Maximum length for a conversation. Default: 300 seconds
      - **Ring Duration** (seconds): Maximum time to wait for call connection. Call will stop ringing if not connected within the specified seconds. Default: 30 seconds

    - **Transcripts & Recording**

      - **Store Transcripts**: Automatically saves the conversation text for review
      - **Store Call Recording**: Automatically saves the call audio recording for review  

1. Click **Schedule Campaign** to save your campaign.

## Contact list format

Your contact list must be a CSV file with the following requirements:

- `phone_number` (required): Phone numbers in E.164 format. For example, `+1234567890`
- Add any custom columns for variables you want to use in your agent's prompts. Column names become variable names accessible in your LLM configuration
- To override agent settings per contact, add columns like `prompt_override`

### Sample contact list

The following is an example of a contact list doe appointment confirmation:

```csv
phone_number,name,appointment_time,preferred_language
+19168888860,John Doe,2025-01-15 10:00 AM,English
+19168888861,Jane Smith,2025-01-15 11:00 AM,Spanish
```

In this example, the agent can reference `{{name}}`, `{{appointment_time}}`, and `{{preferred_language}}` in its system prompts and greeting messages when calling each contact.

## Manage campaigns

### View campaign status

To view your campaigns:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Campaigns** from the sidebar.
1. The campaigns page displays all your campaigns with their current status and progress.

### Control campaign execution

From the campaigns page, you can:

- **Pause**: Temporarily stop the campaign from making new calls
- **Resume**: Continue a paused campaign
- **Stop**: Permanently end the campaign

<Admonition type="info">
Pausing or stopping a campaign does not affect calls that are already in progress.
</Admonition>

### Monitor campaign progress

Track campaign metrics including:

- Total contacts in the list
- Calls completed
- Calls in progress
- Calls pending
- Call outcomes (answered, busy, no answer, failed)

## Campaign results and analytics

After your campaign runs, you can view detailed results:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, select **Campaigns** from the sidebar.
1. Click on a campaign to view its details.
1. Review campaign metrics and call outcomes.

Campaign results include:

- Call duration for each contact
- Call transcripts
- Call status (successful, failed, busy, no answer)
- Contact-specific variables used during the call

## Best practices

- **Test your agent first**: Always test your agent thoroughly before launching a campaign to ensure appropriate responses.
- **Start small**: Begin with a small contact list to verify your campaign configuration works as expected.
- **Monitor actively**: Check campaign progress regularly, especially during the first few calls.
- **Use variables effectively**: Include relevant contact information in your CSV to enable personalized conversations.
- **Schedule appropriately**: Consider time zones and business hours when scheduling campaigns.
