The Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plugin analyzes audio streams in real-time to detect the probability of human voice and background music. This enables you to implement features like automatic muting during silence, smart audio recording, noise suppression, and adaptive audio processing. The extension is compatible with Web SDK v4.15.0 and above.

## Understand the tech

The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Web SDK processes media through the following pipeline:

The VAD plugin operates during the preprocessing stage, analyzing audio data in real-time to detect voice activity and background music.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- Your project integrates the [SDK quickstart](/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) using Web SDK v4.15.0 or later.
- You are using a supported browser:
  - **Desktop**: Latest Chrome (recommended), Edge, or Firefox
  - **Safari**: 14.1+ (supported but not recommended due to performance issues)
- Your system meets performance requirements:
  - **Single plugin**: Standard hardware is sufficient
  - **Multiple plugins**: Use an Intel Core i5 (4-core) or equivalent for best performance
  - **High system load**: Running multiple plugins with heavy CPU usage may cause audio/video to freeze


## Implement the logic

This section shows you how to integrate and use the VAD extension in your project.
