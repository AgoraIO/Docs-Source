1. **Import the required Agora libraries**

    <ImportLibrary />

1. **Declare the required variables**

    <SetDeclarations/>

1. **Use a probe test to check network health**

    <ProbeTest />

1. **Implement best practice for app initiation**

    Use the following <Vg k="VSDK" /> features when you set up an instance of the <Vg k="ENGINE" />:

    * _Enable and configure logging_: For optimization and debugging.
    * _Enable dual stream mode_: Required for multi-user scenarios.
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
    * _Set an audio profile and audio scenario_: Setting an audio profile is optional and only required if you have special requirements such as streaming  music.
    </PlatformWrapper>
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
    * _Set the video profile_: Setting a video profile is also optional. It is useful when you want to change one or more of `mirrorMode`, `frameRate`, `bitrate`, `dimensions`, `orientationMode`, `degradationPrefer` or `compressionPrefer` from the default setting to custom values.
        For more information, see  [video profile table](#video-profile-table).

1. **Test the user's hardware**

    The echo test checks that the user's hardware is working properly.

1. **Switch stream quality**

    Take advantage of dual-stream mode and switch remote video quality to high or low.

7. **Listen to <Vg k="ENGINE" /> events to receive state change notifications and network quality**

    Use the following callbacks monitor and ensure channel quality:

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
    For ultra low-latency applications, set the appropriate audience latency level when joining a channel. Ultra-low latency is a feature of <Vg k="ILS" /> and its use is subject to special [pricing](../reference/pricing#unit-pricing).
