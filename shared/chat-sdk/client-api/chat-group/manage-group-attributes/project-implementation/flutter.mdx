### Manage the chat group shared files

    pageSize: 10,
  );

  if (list.isNotEmpty) {
    await ChatClient.getInstance.groupManager.downloadGroupSharedFile(
      groupId: groupId,
      fileId: list.first.fileId!,

    );
  }
} on ChatError catch (e) {
  debugPrint('$e');
}
```

#### Delete chat group shared files
