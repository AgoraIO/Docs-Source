After decompressing the package, integrate the camera movement plugin from the corresponding version folder according to the real-time interaction SDK version used in your app. For example, if your app uses version 4.2.6 of the real-time interaction SDK, integrate the plugin from the `./sdk/4.2` directory.

  The `AgoraPortraitRhythmExtension.xcframework` is the rhythm plugin library, currently supporting the arm64 and armv7 architectures.

### Add plugin to your app

According to your target development architecture, copy `AgoraPortraitRhythmExtension.xcframework` to the dynamic library directory of the real-time interactive SDK, located at `/rtc/sdk/<target architecture>`. Then, link `AgoraPortraitRhythmExtension.xcframework` to your project in Xcode and set **Embed** to **Embed & Sign**.
