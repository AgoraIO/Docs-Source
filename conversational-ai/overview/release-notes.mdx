## Releases

### v1.2

This version was released on April 10, 2025.

#### New features

- **Broadcast a message using TTS**: A new message broadcast interface enables a specified agent to deliver a custom message. When interacting with an agent, calling this interface interrupts the agent’s speech and thinking process, allowing the TTS module to immediately broadcast the custom message.

- **Interrupt the agent**: The interrupt agent endpoint allows you to stop the specified agent’s speech and thinking process.

#### API Changes

This version adds the following APIs:
- [Broadcast a message using TTS](../rest-api/speak)
- [Interrupt the agent](../rest-api/interrupt)

### v1.1

This version was released on March 27, 2025.

#### New features

The [Start a conversational agent](../rest-api/join) API adds the `enable_rtm`and `agent_rtm_uid` parameters to enable Signaling integration with <Vpd k="AGENT" />. When this feature is enabled, the agent can leverage the Signaling SDK to obtain a users's custom context information such as speaking status, selected text, signature, and score, and pass this data to the agent to generate more relevant content. For details, see [Transmit custom information](../develop/custom-information).

#### Improvements

To help you quickly integrate a custom large language model (LLM), this version adds documentation for [Custom LLMs](../develop/custom-llm). Refer to the sample code in the documentation to integrate your custom model into the conversational AI engine and enable advanced capabilities such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal processing, and tool invocation.

#### API Changes

The `POST` method to [Start a <Vpd k="AGENT" />](../rest-api/join) now includes the `enable_rtm` and `agent_rtm_uid` fields.

### v1.0 (Public Beta)

This version, released on March 4, 2025, adds pricing information for the Agora <Vpd k="NAME" />. For more information, see [Pricing](../overview/pricing).

#### Integration guide

To achieve the best conversation experience, use Agora <Vpd k="NAME" /> with the following Agora SDKs:

- Agora RTC Native SDK, v4.5.1 or later.
- Agora RTC Web SDK, version 4.23.2 or later.

#### New features

- **Live subtitles**: Supports real-time text output of conversations between users and the AI agent for subtitle display in your app's UI. Agora provides an open-source subtitle processing module. Simply integrate the module and call its API to implement live subtitles. For details, see [Display live subtitles](../develop/subtitles).

- **Message Notification Service**: Introduces a new <Vpd k="NAME" /> message notification service. Configure it in the Agora console and subscribe to agent creation, stop, and error events. When a subscribed event occurs, Agora sends the details to your specified callback address. See [Receive event notifications](../develop/event-notifications).

- **Keywords**: Enhances recognition accuracy of <Vpd k="NAME" /> for proprietary words by adding keywords. This feature is currently in Beta stage. For details, [contact technical support](https://agoraio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

### v1.0 (Private Beta)

This version was released on February 18, 2025. The first beta release of the <Vpd k="NAME" /> brings natural, smooth, low-latency, and highly reliable real-time voice conversations with AI agents to Agora channels. It enables you to efficiently build intelligent and immersive interactive experiences. See [Product overview](../overview/product-overview) for details.

#### Core Features

- **Real-time voice conversation**

    Supports natural and smooth real-time voice conversations with AI. It delivers a low-latency, ultra-responsive interactive experience as if the user is communicating with a real person.

- **Intelligent noise suppression**

    Intelligently identifies and suppresses background noise, ensuring clear sound transmission even in noisy environments to provide users with a high-quality audio experience.

- **Background human voice suppression**

    Suppresses background voices and noise while accurately preserving the primary speaker's voice. This ensures a clear and focused interactive experience in multi-speaker environments.

- **Intelligent interruption handling**

    Allows users to interrupt AI at any time to ensure quick and natural responses. This feature enables smooth transitions and avoids mechanical interactions.

- **Intelligent transmission**

    An AI-optimized transmission algorithm ensures stable voice data delivery even in weak network conditions where packet loss reaches 80%. This guarantees conversation continuity and reliability across diverse network environments.

- **Flexible arrangement**

    Supports multiple Large Language Model (LLM) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers, enabling flexible orchestration to meet diverse business needs and deliver highly customizable AI dialogue solutions.
