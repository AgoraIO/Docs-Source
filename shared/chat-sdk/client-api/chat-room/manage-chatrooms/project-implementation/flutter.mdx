### Create a chat room

Only the [app super admin](/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatroom-admins#adding-a-chat-room-super-admin) can call `createChatRoom` to create a chat room and set the chat room attributes such as the chat room name, description, and maximum number of members. Once a chat room is created, the super admin automatically becomes the chat room owner.

The following code sample shows how to create a chat room:

```dart
try {
  ChatRoom room = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.createChatRoom(name);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Destroy a chat room

Only the chat room owner can call `destroyChatRoom` to disband a chat room. Once a chat room is disbanded, all chat room members receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onChatRoomDestroyed` callback and are immediately removed from the chat room.

The following code sample shows how to destroy a chat room:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.destroyChatRoom(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Join a chat room

Refer to the following steps to join a chat room:

1. Call [`fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer`](#retrieve-the-chat-room-list-from-the-server) to retrieve the list of chat rooms from the server and locate the ID of the chat room that you want to join.

2. Call `joinChatRoom` to pass in the chat room ID and join the specified chat room. Once a user joins a chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMemberJoinedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to join a chat room:

```dart
try {
   await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.joinChatRoom(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Leave a chat room

All chat room members can call `leaveChatRoom` to leave the specified chat room. Once a member leaves the chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `ChatRoomManagerListener#onMemberExitedFromChatRoom` callback.

<div class="alert note"> Unlike chat group owners (who cannot leave their groups), a chat room owner can leave a chat room. After re-entering the chat room, this user remains the chat room owner.</div>

The following code sample shows how to leave a chat room:

```dart
try {
   await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.leaveChatRoom(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

By default, after a user leaves a chat room, the Chat SDK removes all chat room messages on the local device. If you do not want these messages removed, set `ChatOptions#deleteMessagesAsExitChatRoom` to `false` when initializing the SDK.

The following code sample shows how to retain the chat room messages after leaving a chat room:

```dart
ChatOptions options = ChatOptions(
      appKey: APPKEY,
      deleteMessagesAsExitChatRoom: false,
    );
```

### Retrieve the chat room attributes

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer` to retrieve the attributes of the a chat room, including the chat room ID, name, description, announcements, owner, admin list, maximum number of members, and whether all members are muted.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room attributes:

```dart
try {
  ChatRoom room = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Retrieve the chat room list from the server

Users can call `fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer` to retrieve the chat room list from the server.

```dart
try {
  ChatPageResult<ChatRoom> result = await ChatClient
      .getInstance.chatRoomManager
      .fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer(
    // The page number from which to start retrieving chat rooms.
    pageNum: pageNum,
    // The maximum number of chat rooms to retrieve with pagination.
    pageSize: pageSize,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Listen for chat room events

To monitor the chat room events, you can listen for the callbacks in the `ChatRoomManagerListener` class and add app logics accordingly. If you want to stop listening for the callback, make sure that you remove the listener to prevent memory leakage.

The following code sample shows how to add and remove the chat room listener:

```dart
// Inherits and implements the `ChatRoomManagerListener` class.
class _ChatRoomPageState extends State<ChatRoomPage>
    implements ChatRoomManagerListener {
  @override
  // Adds the chat room listener.
  void initState() {
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.addChatRoomChangeListener(this);
    super.initState();
  }
  @override
  // Removes the chat room listener.
  void dispose() {
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.removeChatRoomListener(this);
    super.dispose();
  }
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
  @override
  // Occurs when a member is promoted to a chat room admin.
  void onAdminAddedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String admin,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when an admin is demoted to a chat room member.
  void onAdminRemovedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String admin,
  ) {}
    @override
  // Occurs when all chat room members are muted or unmuted.
  void onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged(
    String roomId,
    bool isAllMuted,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when the chat room announcements are updated.
  void onAnnouncementChangedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String announcement,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a chat room instance is destroyed.
  void onChatRoomDestroyed(
    String roomId,
    String? roomName,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a member leaves a chat room.
  void onMemberExitedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String? roomName,
    String participant,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a user joins a chat room.
  void onMemberJoinedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String participant,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a member is added to the chat room mute list.
  void onMuteListAddedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    List<String> mutes,
    String? expireTime,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a member is removed from the chat room mute list.
  void onMuteListRemovedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    List<String> mutes,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when the chat room ownership is transferred.
  void onOwnerChangedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String newOwner,
    String oldOwner,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a member is removed from a chat room.
  void onRemovedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    String? roomName,
    String? participant,
  ) {}
    @override
  // Occurs when a member is added to the chat room allow list.
  void onAllowListAddedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    List<String> members,
  ) {}
  @override
  // Occurs when a member is removed from the chat room mute list.
  void onAllowListRemovedFromChatRoom(
    String roomId,
    List<String> members,
  ) {}
}
```
