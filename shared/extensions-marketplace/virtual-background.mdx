Virtual Background enables users to blur their background or replace it with a solid color or an image. This feature is applicable to scenarios such as online conferences, online classes, and live streaming. It helps protect personal privacy and reduces audience distraction.

<Vg k="RTEE_VB" /> has the following features:

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="macos">
|  Feature  |  Example |
| ---- | ---- |
| Blurred background and image background   |   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1647325748630)   |
| Video/Animated background   |   <video src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1654508267206" poster="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1654571689670"  controls width="100%" height="auto">Your browser does not support the <code>video</code>  element.</video>   |
| Portrait-in-picture   | ![portrait-in-picture](/images/video-sdk/portrait-in-picture.png) Allows the presenter to use slides as the virtual background while superimposing their video. The effect is similar to a weather news cast on television, preventing interruptions during a layout toggle.   |

## Understand the tech

A typical transmission pipeline in the Agora Web SDK consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, preprocessing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and playback. In the preprocessing stage, extensions can modify the audio and video data in the pipeline to implement features such as virtual background and noise cancellation.
