### Manage the contact list

Use this section to understand how to send a contact invitation, listen for contact events, and accept or decline the contact invitation.

#### Send a contact invitation

Call `addContact` to add the specified user as a contact:

```java
//The parameters are the username of the contact to be added and the reason for adding
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().addContact(toAddUsername, reason);
```

#### Listen for contact events

Use `ContactListener` to add the following callback events. When a user receives a contact invitation, you can accept or decline the invitation. 

```java
 ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().setContactListener(new ContactListener() {

            //Occurs when a contact request is approved.
            @Override
            public void onFriendRequestAccepted(String username) { }

            //Occurs when a contact request is rejected.
            @Override
            public void onFriendRequestDeclined(String username) { }

            //Occurs when a contact invitation is received.
            @Override
            public void onContactInvited(String username, String reason) { }

            //Occurs when a contact is deleted.
            @Override
            public void onContactDeleted(String username) { }

            //Occurs when a contact is added.
            @Override
            public void onContactAdded(String username) { }
        });
```

#### Accept or decline the contact invitation

After receiving `onContactInvited`, call `acceptInvitation` or `declineInvitation` to accept or decline the invitation.

```java
// Accept the contact invitation
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().acceptInvitation(username);

// Decline the contact invitation
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().declineInvitation(username);
```

#### Delete a contact

Call `deleteContact` to delete the specified contact. The deleted user receives the `onContactDeleted` callback.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().deleteContact(username);
```

#### Retrieve the contact list

To get the contact list, you can call `getAllContactsFromServer` to retrieve contacts from the server. After that, you can also call `getContactsFromLocal` to retrieve contacts from the local database.

```java
// Retrieves a list of contacts from the server
List<String> usernames = ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getAllContactsFromServer();

// Retrieves a list of contacts from the local database
List<String> usernames = ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getContactsFromLocal
```

### Manage the block list

You can add a specified user to your block list. Once you do that, you can still send chat messages to that user, but you cannot receive messages from them. 

<div class="note alert">Users can add any other chat user to their block list, regardless of whether this other user is a contact or not. A contact added to the block list remains in the contact list.</div>

#### Add a user to the block list

Call `addUserToBlackList` to add the specified user to the block list.

You can add any other users to the block list, regardless of whether they are on the contact list or not. Contacts are still displayed on the contact list even if they are added to the block list. After adding users to the block list,  you can still send messages to them, but will not receive messages from them as they cannot send messages or friend requests to you.

```java
// The effect of true and false is the same.
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().addUserToBlackList(username,true);
```


#### Remove a user from the block list

To remove the specified user from the block list, call `removeUserFromBlackList`.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().removeUserFromBlackList(username);
```

#### Retrieve the block list from the server

To get the block list, call `getBlackListFromServer` to retrieve a list of blocked users from the server. 

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getBlackListFromServer();
```

After retrieving the block list from the server, you can also call `getBlackListUsernames` to retrieve the block list from the local database.

```java
ChatClient.getInstance().contactManager().getBlackListUsernames();
```
