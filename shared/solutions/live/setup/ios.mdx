### Clone the Repository

Agora provides the [agora-live repository](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/agora-live) to demonstrate how to integrate and use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> for live streaming scenarios. To clone the repository locally, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/agora-live.git
```

### Integrate the FaceUnity extension

FaceUnity is a third-party extension. To integrate FaceUnity functionality in the <Vg k="SOL_LIVE" /> project:

1. Download the **Demo** file from the [Extensions Marketplace](https://console.agora.io/marketplace/extension/introduce?serviceName=faceunity-ar-en).

1. Copy the `authpack.h` file to the `/agora-live/iOS/FULib/` folder in the agora-live project.

1. Execute `pod install` to install the necessary libraries and dependencies.

### Configure the project

Take the following steps to configure your project:

1. Open the `Agora-Live` iOS project located in the `<parent directory>/agora-live/iOS/` directory in Xcode.

    ![Agora Live iOS Project](/images/solutions/live/agoralive_ios_project.png)

1. Set the <Vg k="VSDK" /> and Media Pull parameters as follows:

    ```swift
    //
    //  KeyCenter.swift
    
    @objcMembers
    class KeyCenter: NSObject {
        
        
        // Agora APP ID.
        static let AppId: String = "<Your Agora app ID>"
        // App certificate 
        // If the project does not have certificates enabled, leave this field blank.
        static let Certificate: String? = "<Your Agora app certificate>"
        
        // Authentication token
        static var Token: String? = nil
        // EaseMob APPKEY.
        // The application name filled in when creating an application on the EaseMob console.
        // If you need to use Chat Room, you must to set this parameter.
        static var IMAppKey: String? = "Your EaseMob APPKEY"
        
        //EaseMob Client ID used to generate app tokens to call REST API.
        // If you need to use Chat Room, you must to set this parameter.
        static var IMClientId: String? = nil
        
        // EaseMob Client Secret used to generate app tokens to call REST API.
        // If you need to use Chat Room, you must to set this parameter.
        static var IMClientSecret: String? = nil

        // Media Pull Key and Secret 
        static let CloudPlayerKey: String? = nil
        static let CloudPlayerSecret: String? = nil
        
        static var HostUrl: String = "https://gateway-fulldemo.agoralab.co"
        static var baseServerUrl: String? = "https://service.agora.io/toolbox-overseas/v1/"
        static var onlineBaseServerUrl: String? = baseServerUrl
    }
    ```

    After creating an Agora project, obtain the values of the following parameters from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. 

    | Parameter | Description | How to Obtain |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------ |
    | `AppId` | Agora project's App ID | Obtain App ID |
    | `Certificate` | Agora project's App Certificate  | Obtain App Certificate |
    | `CloudPlayerKey` | Customer ID required for Agora's RESTful service to input online media streams | Obtain Customer ID and Secret |
    | `CloudPlayerSecret` | Customer secret required for Agora's RESTful service to input online media streams | Obtain Customer ID and Secret |

    To obtain these parameters refer to [Agora account management](/video-calling/reference/manage-agora-account?platform=android#get-the-app-id).

1. In the `agora-live/iOS` directory, run `pod install` and wait for the dependencies to finish installing.

### Compile and run the project

To compile and run the <Vg k="SOL_LIVE" /> project, follow these steps:

1. Connect your iOS device. Open the project by clicking on the `AgoraEntScenarios.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and select your iOS device in the iOS Device options.

1. In the **Signing & Capabilities** section under **TARGETS**, check **Automatically manage signing** and configure your Apple Developer account and Bundle Identifier. When developing an app, you need to set a Bundle ID. The Bundle ID set here should match the one you provided when requesting the FaceUnity SDK.

1. Click the **Play** button to start compiling.

1. Once the compilation is successful, the Agora Live app appears on your iOS device. You will need to trust the developer in your iOS system settings before you can open the app.

5. Open the app on your iOS device. Explore the features in the demo app.
