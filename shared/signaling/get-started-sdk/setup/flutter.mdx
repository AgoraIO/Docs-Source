To create a new Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    flutter create sdk_quickstart
    ```

1. Open the project in your IDE. Add the <Vg k="SIG" /> SDK dependency to `pubspec.yaml` under `dependencies`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
    # Add the Signaling SDK dependency, use the latest version number
      agora_rtm: ^2.2.1
    ```

    <Admonition type="info">
    To integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> version 2.2.1 or above, and <Vg k="VSDK" /> version 4.3.0 or above at the same time, refer to [handle integration issues](/help/integration-issues/rtm2_rtc_integration_issue).
    </Admonition>

1. To install the dependencies, open the terminal and execute the following command in the project path:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

1.  To create a basic template for your project, open `main.dart`, delete the contents of the file, and paste the following code:

    ```dart
    import 'package:agora_rtm/agora_rtm.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'dart:convert';

    void main() async {
        // Wait for Widgets to be initialized.
        WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();        

        // Create a Signaling client instance

        // Login to Signaling

        // Subscribe to a channel

        // Publish messages

        // Unsubscribe from a channel

        // Logout from Signaling

    }
    ```
</PlatformWrapper>
