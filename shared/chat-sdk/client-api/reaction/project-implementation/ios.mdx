### Add a reaction

Call `addReaction` to add a reaction to the specified message. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `messageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (reaction ID, user ID of the user that adds the reaction, and the addition operation).

For a reaction, a user can add only once, or the error 1301 is reported for repeated addition.

```objc
// Add a reaction
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager addReaction:"reaction" toMessage:"messageId" completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {
	refreshBlock(error, changeSelectedStateHandle);
}];
// Listen for the state of the reaction.
- (void)messageReactionDidChange:(NSArray<AgoraChatMessageReactionChange *> *)changes
{
	
}
```

### Remove a reaction

Call `removeReaction` to remove the specified reaction. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `messageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (ID of the removed reaction, user ID of the user that removes the reaction, and the removal operation).

```objc
// Remove the reaction.
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager removeReaction:"reaction" fromMessage:"messageId" completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {
	refreshBlock(error, changeSelectedStateHandle);
}];
// Listen for reaction state change.
- (void)messageReactionDidChange:(NSArray<AgoraChatMessageReactionChange *> *)changes
{
	
}
```

### Retrieve a list of reactions

Call `getReactionList` to retrieve a list of reactions of messages from the server. This method also returns the basic information of the reactions, including the content of the reaction, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and a list of the first three user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getReactionList:@["messageId"] groupId:@"groupId" chatType:AgoraChatTypeChat completion:^(NSDictionary<NSString *, AgoraChatMessageReaction *> * _Nonnull, AgoraChatError * _Nullable) {
                    
}];
```

### Retrieve the details of the reaction

Call `getReactionDetail` to get the detailed information of the reaction from the server. The detailed information includes the reaction content, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and the complete list of user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.chatManager getReactionDetail:@"messageId" reaction:@"reaction" cursor:nil pageSize:30 completion:^(AgoraChatMessageReaction * _Nonnull, NSString * _Nullable cursor, AgoraChatError * _Nullable) {
            
}];
```
