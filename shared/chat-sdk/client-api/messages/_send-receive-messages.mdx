After logging in to Chat, users can send the following types of messages to a peer user, a chat group, or a chat room:

- Attachment messages, including image, voice, video, and file messages.

- Location messages.

- CMD messages.

The Chat message feature is language agnostic. End users can send messages in any language, as long as their devices support input in that language.
