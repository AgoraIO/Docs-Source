To integrate <Vpd k="NAME"/> into your app, do the following:

1. **Set up a Flutter environment for a <Vpd k="NAME"/> project**

    In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Flutter checks your development device and helps you [set up](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor) your local development environment. Make sure that your system passes all the checks.

1. **Create a new Flutter <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    In the IDE of your choice, create a new [Flutter Application project](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/android-studio#creating-a-new-project).

    You can also create a new project from the terminal using the following command:

    ```bash
    flutter create <--insert project name-->
    ```

1. **Add <Vpd k="SDK" /> to your project**

    Add the following line to the `<project_folder>/pubspec.yaml` file under `dependencies`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
    ...
      # For x.y.z, fill in a specific SDK version number. For example, 1.0.9
      agora_chat_sdk: ^x.y.z
    ...
    ```
    To get the latest <Vpl k="NAME" /> <Vpd k="SDK" /> version number, visit [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages?q=agora_chat_sdk).

    You can also add the <Vpd k="SDK" /> dependency to your project by running the following command in the project folder:

    ```bash
    flutter pub add agora_chat_sdk
    ```

1. **Use the Flutter framework to download dependencies to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    Open a terminal window and execute the following command in the project folder:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

1. **Add platform specific requirements**

    Update the minimum version requirements for your target platforms as follows:

    * **Android**

        In the `<project_folder>/android/app/build.gradle` file, set the Android `minSdkVersion` to `21` under `defaultConfig {`.

        ``` json
        android {
            defaultConfig {
                minSdkVersion 21
            }
        }
        ```

    * **iOS**

        Open the `<project_folder>/ios/Runner.xcodeproj` file in **Xcode**, and select **TARGETS** > **Runner** in the left sidebar. In the **General** > **Deployment Info** section, set the minimum iOS version to `iOS 10.0`.
