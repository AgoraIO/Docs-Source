Agora Real-Time Speech-To-Text (STT) enables you to transcribe audio of each host to provide live closed captions (CC) and transcription for improved accessibility. Real-Time STT also removes silent audio to improve transcription performance and reduce cost. The output text can be processed for LLM (for example, GPT). Real-Time STT is the first step in letting Real-Time Engagement enter the AI area.
