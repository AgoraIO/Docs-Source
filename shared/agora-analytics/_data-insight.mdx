## Usage Overview

The **Usage Overview** page presents **Overall Trend** and **Metric Analysis** for usage metrics, which can help you locate the dates with abnormalities and understand how usage is distributed in different dimensions.

<div class="alert warning">The usage data provided in the Usage Overview page is for reference only and is not used for billing calculation.</div>

### Overall Trend

The **Overall Trend** panel has three sections: **Peak traffic**, **Channel and user count**, and **Service minutes**. In each section, the summary boxes in the upper-left corner highlight the aggregate or peak value of each usage metric, and the line chart in the bottom area shows the daily values of each usage metric. You can click **All data** in the top-right corner of each section to download the data or view it in table form.

The usage metrics are described in [Usage metrics](#usage-metrics).

Each line chart provides the following features:

-   Hide and display: To hide or display the line for a usage metric, click on the corresponding summary box.

-   Change time selection: When data granularity is set to **By day** in the data filter, you can click a data point and select **Hourly data**, which changes the data granularity to hourly and the time frame to the corresponding hour. To switch back to the original time selection, click **Restore filter** in the upper-center area of the Overall Trend panel.

-   Jump to Metric Analysis: To jump to the Metric Analysis panel of a usage metric for a specific day, click the corresponding data point on the line, and select **Metric Analysis**. If you want to use the previously selected time frame, click **Reset time** in the upper-left area of the Metric Analysis panel.

### Metric Analysis

The **Metric Analysis** panel has six sections: **Geography**, **Network type**, **Operating system**, **SDK version**, **Device type**, and **Channel size**. Each section presents the top six values for that dimension in bar-chart form.

In the top-right corner of the panel, you can select the usage metric you want to view. In the top-right corner of each section, you can click **All data** to download the data or view it in table form.

![1626938976055](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1626938976055)

The six dimensions are described in [Dimensions](#dimensions).

## Quality Overview

The **Quality Overview** page presents **Overall Trend** and **Metric Analysis** for quality metrics, which can help you locate the dates and hours with abnormalities and understand how quality is related to usage in different dimensions.

### Overall Trend

The **Overall Trend** panel has two sections: **User experience** and **Success at joining channels**. In each section, the summary boxes in the upper-left corner highlight the peak or bottom value of each quality metric, and the line chart in the bottom area shows the daily or hourly values of each quality metric. You can click **All data** in the top-right corner of the section to download the data or view it in table form.

The quality metrics are described in [Quality metrics](#quality-metrics).

Each line chart provides the following features:

-   Hide and display: To hide or display the line for a quality metric, click on the corresponding summary box.

-   Change time selection:

-   When data granularity is set to **By day** in the data filter, you can click a data point and select **Hourly data**, which changes the data granularity to hourly and the time frame to the corresponding hour. To switch back to the original filter setting, click **Restore filter** in the upper-center area of the Overall Trend panel.

-   When data granularity is set to **By hour** in the data filter, you can click a data point and select **Minutely data**, which changes the data granularity to minutely and the time frame to the corresponding minute. To switch back to the original filter setting, click **Restore filter** in the upper-center area of the Overall Trend panel.

-   Jump to Metric Analysis: To jump to the Metric Analysis panel of a quality metric for a specific day or hour, click the corresponding data point on the line, and select **Metric Analysis**. If you want to use the previously selected time frame, click **Reset time** in the upper-left area of the Metric Analysis panel.

Additionally, the line chart for **User experience** provides the data sampling feature:

-   Channel data sampling: When data granularity is set to **By day** or **By minute**, click a data point and select **Channel data sampling** to view its scatter chart. The x coordinates are described in [Quality metrics](#quality-metrics).

-   User data sampling: On the scatter chart, click a data point and select **User data sampling** to view the top six users who experience a high freeze rate. To view call quality details about a user, click **Call Inspector** to use the [Call Inspector](./video-voice-sdk/call-search) function.

### Metric Analysis

The **Metric Analysis** panel has six sections: **Geography**, **Network type**, **Operating system**, **SDK version**, **Device type**, and **Channel size**. Each section presents the connection between quality and usage in bubble-chart form.

In the top-right corner of the panel, you can select the quality metric you want to view. In the top-right corner of each section, you can click **All data** to download the data or view it in table form.

![1626938998631](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1626938998631)

The six dimensions are described in [Dimensions](#dimensions).

In the country and region bubble charts, the Y coordinate is the value of the selected metric, and the corresponding X coordinate is listed in [Quality metrics](#quality-metrics). The bubble color represents whether the metric value is normal. The bubble turns red if one of the following occurs:
- The video freeze rate exceeds 5%.
- The audio freeze rate exceeds 3%.
- The network delay rate exceeds 10%.
- The success rate of users joining channels is below 95%, or the success rate of users joining channels within 5 seconds is below 95%.

## Key terms

This section describes the key terms used in **Data Insights**. See [Agora Key Terms](/agora-analytics/reference/glossary) for more key terms.

### Channel

Every audio or video call happens in a channel. If an app is a building, a channel is a room in the building.

**Data Insights** does not count a channel by name, but by lifecycle. A channel is counted once for each period of time between when the first user joins it until the last user leaves it. That is, it is not counted when there are no users.

### User

Each user in a channel is identified by a unique [user ID](/agora-analytics/reference/glossary#user-iduid). There can never be two identical user IDs in a channel.

**Data Insights** counts each instance of a unique user ID. If a real-life user joins one channel using multiple user IDs, or joins multiple channels using one user ID, **Data Insights** counts the user in both situations as multiple users.

### Dimensions

| Dimension        | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| Channel size     | The number of users in the channel.                     |

### Calculating usage by the number of users vs. by the number of streams

There are two different approaches to calculating <Vg k="VSDK" /> service minutes for a channel: by the number of users in the channel, and by the number of streams each user is subscribed to in the channel. Their difference is described in [How does Agora calculate service minutes](/agora-analytics/reference/billing-policies#how-does-agora-calculate-service-minutes).

### Data sampling criteria

Line charts under the **Overall Trend** panel on the **Quality Overview** page support data sampling. The data sampling criteria is defined as follows:

| Line chart         | Data sampling criteria                                                                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Video freeze rate  | The video freeze rate exceeds 5%, and the video minutes across all channels exceed 100 in one minute.   |
| Audio freeze rate  | The audio freeze rate exceeds 3%, and the audio minutes across all channels exceed 100 in one minute.   |
| Network delay rate | The network delay rate exceeds 10%, and the total minutes across all channels exceed 100 in one minute. |
