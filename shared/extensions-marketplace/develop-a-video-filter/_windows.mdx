#### Sample code



## Package the video filter extension



After encapsulating the filter into an extension, you need to register and package it into a `.dll` file, and submit it together with a file that contains the extension name, vendor name and filter name to Agora.
### Register the extension



Register the extension with the macro `REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER`, which is in the `AgoraExtensionProviderEntry.h` file.

Use this macro at the entrance of the extension implementation. When the SDK loads the extension, this macro automatically registers it to the SDK. For example:

```objc
REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER(ByteDance, agora::extension::ExtensionProvider);
```





### Provide extension information

Create a `.md` file to provide the following information:
- `EXTENSION_NAME`: The name of the extension package. For example, the `EXTENSION_NAME` of `libagora-bytedance.dll` is `agora-bytedance`.
- `EXTENSION_VENDOR_NAME`: The name of the extension provider, which is used for registering in the `agora-bytedance.cpp` file.
- `EXTENSION_FILTER_NAME`: The name of the filter, which is defined in `ExtensionProvider.h`.
