This section explains how to implement video encryption on the sender side and decryption on the receiver side using Chrome as an example. The steps for Safari are slightly different.

The example uses the AES encryption algorithm from the Web Crypto API. If you need a custom encryption algorithm, you can use WebAssembly to implement it.

1. **Publish the encrypted media stream**

    To establish a WebRTC Encoded Transform processing pipeline, the sender should follow these steps:

      1. After publishing the local video track, call the `getRTCRtpTransceiver` method provided by the SDK to obtain the instance of the local video track's `RTCRtpTransceiver`. Then, retrieve the instance of `RTCRtpSender` through the `sender` property.

      2. Use the browser's native Streams API to encrypt the video stream.

    The sample code is as follows:
    ```javascript
    async function publish() {
      // Publish the local video track
      await client.publish([localVideoTrack]);

      // Get the RTCRtpTransceiver instance for the local video track
      const transceiver = localVideoTrack.getRTCRtpTransceiver();
      if (!transceiver || !transceiver.sender) {
        return;
      }
      // Get the RTCRtpSender to control the media data being sent
      const sender = transceiver.sender;

      // Define the encryption method for the Chrome browser
      if (isChrome) {
        // Create an encoded stream for encryption transformation
        const streams = sender.createEncodedStreams();
        // Create the encryption transformer
        const transformer = new TransformStream({
          transform(chunk, controller) {
            // The first 7 bytes of VP8 video key frames and the first 3 bytes of non-key frames need to be preserved and not encrypted; otherwise, media transmission will fail
            const vp8ReservedSize = chunk.type === 'key' ? 7 : 3;
            // The encrypt method must be implemented by the developer based on encryption requirements
            // The example uses the AES encryption algorithm provided by the Web Crypto API
            const encryptedChunk = encrypt(chunk, key, vp8ReservedSize);
            controller.enqueue(encryptedChunk);
          }
        });

        // Connect the encoded stream and the encryption transformer, and write the result to the data stream
        streams.readable.pipeThrough(transformer).pipeTo(streams.writable);
      }
    }
    ```
2. **Subscribe to the encrypted media stream**

    The steps for establishing the WebRTC Encoded Transform processing pipeline on the receiving end are as follows:

      1. When subscribing to a remote video stream, call the method provided by the SDK `getRTCRtpTransceiver` to obtain an instance of the remote video track's `RTCRtpTransceiver`.

      2. Call the browser's native Streams API to decrypt the video stream.
    
    The sample code is as follows:
    ```javascript
    async function subscribe(user, mediaType) {
      // Get the RTCRtpTransceiver instance of the remote video track
      const transceiver = user.videoTrack.getRTCRtpTransceiver();
      if (!transceiver || !transceiver.receiver) {
        return;
      }

      // Get the RTCRtpReceiver to control the received media data
      const receiver = transceiver.receiver;

      // Define the decryption method for Chrome browser
      if (isChrome) {
        // Create an encoded stream for decryption
        const streams = receiver.createEncodedStreams();
        // Create a decryption transformer
        const transformer = new TransformStream({
          transform(chunk, controller) {
            // The first 7 bytes of VP8 video keyframes and the first 3 bytes of non-keyframes do not need decryption
            const vp8ReservedSize = chunk.type === 'key' ? 7 : 3;
            // The decrypt method needs to be implemented by the developer according to decryption requirements
            const decryptedChunk = decrypt(chunk, key, vp8ReservedSize);
            controller.enqueue(decryptedChunk);
          }
        });

        // Connect the encoded stream and the decryption transformer, and write the results to the data stream
        streams.readable.pipeThrough(transformer).pipeTo(streams.writable);
      }
    }
    ```
