Take the following steps to run and test the sample code:

1. In your `.js` file, update the values for `appId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Use the same `channel` name you used to generate the token.


1. To start the development server, use the following command:
    
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal, for example, `http://localhost:5173`.

    You see the following page:

    <ProductWrapper product='video-calling, voice-calling'>
    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-ui-web.png)
    </ProductWrapper>
    <ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>
    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-ui-web-ils.png)
    </ProductWrapper>

1. On a second device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) or clone the [sample project on Github](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples-Web) to join the same channel and test the following use-cases:
 
    <ProductWrapper product="[video-calling, voice-calling]">
    1. Click **Join** to join the channel. 
    1. Enter the same app ID, channel name, and temporary token.
    <ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
        Once your friend joins the channel, you can hear each other.
    </ProductWrapper>
    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
        Once your friend joins the channel, you can see and hear each other.
    </ProductWrapper>
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>
    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves; the audience can see the host in the remote video view and hear the host.
