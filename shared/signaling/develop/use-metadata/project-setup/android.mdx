Open the `build.gradle Module:<project name>` file and ensure that you are using version `1.6.0` or higher of the `rtm-special-sdk`. You should have a line similar to the following under `dependencies`:

```groovy
implementation 'io.agora.rtm:rtm-special-sdk:<version>'
```

Replace `<version>` with the latest version number. To find the latest version, use [Maven central repository search](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.agora.rtm/rtm-special-sdk).
