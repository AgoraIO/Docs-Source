Agora provides an open source [`VideoLoaderAPI`](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/VideoLoaderAPI) sample project on GitHub that includes APIs for fast channel loading and switching. To integrate the APIs into your project, take the following steps:

1. Copy the following folders and files from the repository to the same folder as your `*.xcodeproj` file:

    - [`VideoLoaderAPI`](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/VideoLoaderAPI/tree/main/iOS/VideoLoaderAPI) folder

    - [`VideoLoaderAPI.podspec`](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/VideoLoaderAPI/blob/main/iOS/VideoLoaderAPI.podspec) file

1. In the terminal, go to the directory where the `*.xcodeproj` file is located and run the `pod init` command. A **Podfile** text file is generated in the project folder.

1. Open the **Podfile** file and modify it as follows:

    ```ruby
    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
    use_frameworks!
    
    platform :ios, '13.0'
    
    # Change the target to the actual Target name in your project.
    target 'VideoLoaderAPI_Example' do
    pod 'VideoLoaderAPI', :path => 'VideoLoaderAPI.podspec'
    
        target 'VideoLoaderAPI_Tests' do
            inherit! :search_paths
        end
    end
    ```

1. In the terminal, go to the directory where the `*.xcodeproj` file is located and execute `pod install` to install the dependencies.

    After successful installation of the dependency library, a `*.xcworkspace` file appears.

1. (Optional) If you have previously integrated a <Vg k="VSDK" /> dependency in your project, open the `VideoLoaderAPI.podspec` file and modify the dependency version as needed.

    ```shell
    # 4.1.1.19 is the default version installed in step 4, if you are using a different version, change it to the current one.
    s.dependency 'AgoraRtcEngine_Special_iOS', '4.1.1.19'
    ```
