The <Vg k="SIG"/> storage service enables you to store and share contextual channel data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, such as props, announcements, member lists, and relationship chains. When channel metadata is set, updated, or deleted, the SDK triggers a storage event notification. Other users in the channel receive this notification within 100ms and use the information according to your business logic. 

## Understand the tech

Use channel metadata to store and share channel level information such as room attributes, group announcements, and auction item price updates. A set of channel metadata for a specific channel facilitates business-level data storage and real-time notifications. Each channel has only one set of channel metadata, but each set may contain multiple metadata items. For relevant restrictions, refer to the [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations). Each metadata item has `key`, `value`, and `revision` properties.

Channel metadata is stored permanently in the <Vg k="SIG" /> database. The data persists even after a channel is destroyed. You must explicitly delete it to remove it from the database. This feature impacts your storage billing. Refer to [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details.

The storage service is available for both message channels and stream channels. Use the `channelType` parameter in the storage event to determine the channel type.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have integrated the <Vpd k="SDK" /> in your project and implemented the framework functionality from the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart) page.

## Implement channel metadata storage

The section shows you how to implement channel metadata storage in your <Vpd k="NAME" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
