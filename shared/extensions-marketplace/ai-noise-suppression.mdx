Agora's <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />, enables you to suppress hundreds of types of noise and reduce distortion in human voices when multiple people speak at the same time. In scenarios such as online meetings, online chat rooms, video consultations with doctors, and online gaming, <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> makes virtual communication as smooth as face-to-face interaction.

## Understand the tech

The typical transmission pipeline for extensions in <Vg k="VSDK" /> consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, preprocessing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and playback. In the preprocessing stage, <Vg k="RTEE_NS"/> uses deep learning noise reduction algorithms to modify data in the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

To use the <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension, you must meet the following requirements:

- Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.
- [Noise type](#type) matches your business scenario.  For example, if you want the microphone to collect background music, the extension is not applicable because it categorizes such background music as noise.
<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- You have the latest version of Desktop Chrome (recommended), Edge, or Firefox.
- Implemented your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="VSDK" /> for Web v4.15.0 or later.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
- Minimum device requirements
    - iOS iPhone 6S
    - iPadOS
    - iPad Pro (2nd generation)
    - iPad mini (5th generation)
    - iPad Air (3rd generation)
    - macOS MacBook Pro 2015
- Ensure that the dynamical extension library `AgoraAiNoiseSuppressionExtension.xcframework` is integrated into your project.

When <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> is enabled, if <Vg k="VSDK" /> detects that the device performance is not sufficient, it:

- Disables <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />
- Enables traditional noise reduction
- Throws the -1054(WARN_APM_AINS_CLOSED) error code.

## Implementation

This section explains how to use the latest version of the <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension. Implementation for previous versions might be different. For details, see the [release notes](/extensions-marketplace/reference/release-notes#ai-noise-suppression).

To implement <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, follow these steps:

### API reference

### Considerations

Currently,  <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> has the following limitations:

- If the sample rate of the input signal is not 16 KHz,  <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />:
    1. Downsamples the signal to 16 KHz.
    1. Removes noise
    1. Resamples the output signal to the original sample rate.
    This means that audio data above 8 KHz is removed in the output signal.

- In some unknown scenarios, <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> could cause audio quality to decrease by a certain degree.
- When multiple people speak at the same time, the audio quality of lowest human voices could be decreased by a certain degree.
- If only some of the audio tracks on the current web page enable <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />, audio tracks that do not enable <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> could be affected. This is because <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> turns on AEC and AGC and turns off NS in the browser.
- Best practice is to not support Safar. Although <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> supports Safari v14.1 and greater, there are Safari performance issues for <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />.
- <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> does not support browsers on mobile devices.
