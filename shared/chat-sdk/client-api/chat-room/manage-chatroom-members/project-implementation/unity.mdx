### Remove a member from a chat room

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `DeleteRoomMembers` to remove the specified member from a chat room. Once removed from the chat room, this member receives the `OnRemovedFromRoom` callback, while all the other members receive the `OnMemberExitedFromRoom` callback. Users can join the chat room again after being removed.

The following code sample shows how to remove a member from a chat room:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.DeleteRoomMembers(roomId, members, new CallBack(
  onSuccess: () => {
  },
  onError: (code, desc) => {
  }
));
```

### Retrieve the chat room member list

All chat room members can call `FetchRoomMembers` to retrieve the member list of the current chat room.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room member list:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.FetchRoomMembers(roomId, cursor, pageSize, handle: new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<string>>(
  // `members` is of the CursorResult<string> type
  onSuccess: (members) => {
  },
  onError: (code, desc) => {
  }
));
```

### Manage the chat room block list

#### Add a member to the chat room block list

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `BlockRoomMembers` to add the specified member to the chat room block list. Once added to the block list, this member receives the `OnRemovedFromRoom` callback, while all the other members receive the `OnMemberExitedFromRoom` callback. After being added to block list, this user cannot send or receive messages in the chat room. They can no longer join the chat room again until they are removed from the block list.

The following code sample shows how to add a member to the chat room block list:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.BlockRoomMembers(roomId, members, new CallBack(
  onSuccess: () =>

  },
  onError: (code, desc) =>
