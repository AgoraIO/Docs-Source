The Agora Extensions Marketplace has a complete workflow for vendors to develop and distribute extensions. This page walks through each step in the workflow.

## Step 1: Apply to be a vendor

To become a vendor, fill in the [vendor application form (This doc is not migrated yet)](https://www.agora.io/en/extensions-marketplace/vendor-application/) and click **APPLY NOW** to submit it.

Agora reviews your application in 7 working days and sends you the result through an email.

## Step 2: Develop your extension

Once your application to become a partner is approved, you can start developing your extension. Agora provides the following documentation for your reference:

- To develop an audio or video extension for iOS, Android, macOS, or Windows, refer to:
  - [Understand extensions](./understand-extensions?platform=Android)
  - [Audio filter extensions](./audio_filter_android)
  - [Video filter extensions](./video_filter_android)
- To develop an audio or video extension for Web, refer to:
  - [Understand extensions](./plugin_web_ng)
  - [Audio extensions](./audio_processor_web_ng)
  - [Video extensions](./video_processor_web_ng)
- To share provisioning, usage, and billing information with Agora, refer to:
  - [Provisioning API](./provisioning)
  - [Usage and billing API](./usage)
- To improve user experience of your extension through clear documentation, refer to:

## Step 3: Test your extension

When your extension is almost developed, you need to test the functionality and performance of your extension. You also need to validate the user interface of your extension in a test environment.

To test your extension, submit an application for testing. For details, see [Test Your Extension (This doc is not migrated yet)](./test-extension).

Agora processes your application in 7 working days and informs you through an email when it's done.

## Step 4: Publish your extension

When your extension is thoroughly developed and tested, you need to submit it for Agora review and provide the finalized version of your extension listing assets. For details, see [Publish Your Extension (This doc is not migrated yet)](./publish-extension).

Agora reviews your extension in 7 working days. If your extension passes the review, Agora updates the listing of your extension and informs you through an email. If your extension fails the review, Agora sends an email to report the issues you need to address.

Once you are ready to go, Agora publishes your extension in the [Extensions Marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/) and everyone can see it.
