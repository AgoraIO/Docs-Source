For message channels, you do not need to define or create a channel before using it. When you send a message or subscribe to a message channel for the first time, <Vg k="SIG" /> automatically creates the channel for you.

When using stream channels, although a channel is essentially ready-to-use, you must explicitly call the <code>{props.createStreamChannel}</code> method to create an instance of a <code>{props.streamChannel}</code> object, before joining the channel.
