3.  In **preload.js**, update `appID`, `channel` and `token` with your values.

4.  Run the app
    
    Execute the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    You see your app opens a window named **Get started with <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />**.

5. When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts, it does the following:

    * Sets the audio profile 

    * Starts the network probe test.
    
    You see the result of the network probe test displayed in the network status label.

6. Press **Echo Test**

   Briefly speak into the microphone; your audio is played back to you after about four seconds. The playback means that the speakers and microphone on your device are working properly. The quality of the playback indicates the suitability of your network connection for audio communication. Press the same button to stop the echo test.

7. Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.

8. Run the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> on a second test device and join the same channel.

9. After joining a channel, you see messages in the console informing you of some selected call statistics, including: 

    * The number of users in the channel
    * Packet loss rate

10. You see the network status indicator updated periodically based on the result of the `onNetworkQuality` callback.
