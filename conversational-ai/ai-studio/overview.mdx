  Build and manage intelligent conversational AI agents.
---

Convo AI Studio is a visual interface in the Agora Console that enables you to create, configure, and deploy conversational AI agents without writing code. You can build agent pipelines with your preferred LLM, ASR, and TTS providers, test agent behavior in real-time, and deploy to production environments with built-in telephony support.

Studio simplifies agent management by providing a centralized workspace to manage credentials, configure agent behavior, and monitor deployments. Whether you're building voice agents for customer support or creating outbound calling campaigns, Studio streamlines the development process from concept to production.

## Key benefits

- **Visual configuration management**: Switch between ASR, LLM, and TTS providers and customize key parameters through an intuitive interface without managing API calls directly.

- **Cloud-based storage**: Your pipeline configurations and credentials are securely stored in your Agora account and can be reused across multiple agents, eliminating the need to reconfigure settings for each deployment.

- **Simplified workflow**: Studio handles the complexity of integrating multiple AI services, allowing you to focus on agent behavior and user experience rather than API integration details.

## Key concepts

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a reusable agent configuration template that defines how your conversational AI agent processes interactions. Each pipeline specifies the ASR provider for speech recognition, the LLM provider for conversation logic, and the TTS provider for voice synthesis. You can configure key parameters for each provider through the Studio interface.

Studio provides templates to help you get started quickly. Once created, you can use a single pipeline to deploy multiple agent instances across different channels or use cases.

### Agents

An agent is a deployed instance created from a pipeline. When you deploy an agent, it uses the configuration defined in its source pipeline to handle conversations. You can create multiple agents from the same pipeline, allowing you to deploy identical configurations across different channels or environments.

### My Resources

My Resources is your centralized credential management system within Studio. Here you can securely store and manage API keys and region settings for your LLM, ASR, and TTS providers. Credentials saved in My Resources are stored in your Agora account and can be reused across all your pipelines, making it easy to update provider settings without reconfiguring individual agents.

## Convo AI Studio workflow

A typical workflow in Convo AI Studio follows these steps:

- **Set up credentials**: Add your LLM, ASR, and TTS provider credentials to My Resources. This one-time setup allows you to reuse these credentials across all your pipelines.

- **Create a pipeline**: Start from a template or create a custom pipeline by selecting your preferred providers and configuring key parameters such as voice characteristics, language models, and speech recognition settings.

- **Create and test an agent**: Deploy an agent instance from your pipeline and test its behavior directly in Studio. Use the built-in testing tools to verify conversation flow and troubleshoot any issues before production deployment.

- **Deploy to production**: Once testing is complete, deploy your agent to production environments. For telephony use cases, import phone numbers and configure outbound calling campaigns.

## Studio capabilities

Convo AI Studio provides comprehensive tools for building and managing conversational AI agents:

- **Pipeline management**: Create pipelines from templates, configure provider settings, and manage agent configurations in one place
- **Credential management**: Securely store and reuse API keys and region settings for all supported providers
- **Agent testing**: Test agent behavior in real-time with built-in debugging tools to identify and resolve issues
- **Deployment management**: Deploy agents to production and manage active deployments
- **Telephony integration**: Import phone numbers from SIP domains and create outbound calling campaigns

## Who should use Studio

Convo AI Studio is designed for developers and technical users who want to configure and fine-tune conversational AI agents without managing API integrations directly. While Studio focuses on key configuration parameters rather than exposing all API-supported options, it provides enough flexibility to customize agent behavior for most use cases.

If you need access to advanced API parameters not available in Studio, you can use the Conversational AI Engine API for full programmatic control.
