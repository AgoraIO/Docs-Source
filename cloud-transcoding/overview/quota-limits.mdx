This article describes the quota limits for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

### Peak concurrent workload

Peak Concurrent Workload (PCW) limits determine the maximum number of concurrent transcoding tasks you can run simultaneously. These limits vary based on the output video resolution and the geographic region where the service is deployed.

| Service region         | SD               | HD                |   FHD               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Americas               | 0                | 0                 | 0                   |
| Europe                 | 10               | 5                 | 2                   |
| Asia (excluding Mainland China) | 20      | 10                | 3                   |
| Mainland China         | 20               | 10                | 5                   |

Video resolution are defined as follows:

 * **SD:** Standard definition, resolution ≤ `640 × 360`
 * **HD:** High definition, `640 × 360` < resolution ≤ `1280 × 720`
 * **FHD:** Full high definition, `1280 × 720` < resolution ≤ `1920 × 1080`

### Request rate limits

The following limits apply to API requests made to the Cloud Transcoding service:

- The maximum number of requests to the <Vg k="CT"/> server is 10 requests per second (QPS) per account.
- If the limit is exceeded, the server returns status code 429 (Too Many Requests).
- In concurrent scenarios, your request rate must not exceed 10% of the PCW. For example, if your PCW is 10, you can make at most 1 request per second.

### Resolution and channel limits

The service enforces the following technical limits on video processing:

- The maximum supported video resolution is 1920 × 1080.
- The maximum supported frame rate is 30 fps.
- The maximum number of streams that can be transcoded concurrently depends on your region and stream resolution, as shown in the PCW table above.

#### Channel limit guidelines

If you're transcoding multiple resolutions at the same time:

* The number of streams for each resolution level must not exceed the individual limit for that resolution.
* The total number of transcoded streams must not exceed the maximum allowed across all resolutions.

**Example:**
In Asia, you can transcode up to:

* 20 SD streams
* 10 HD streams
* A combination such as 10 SD + 10 HD (but not exceeding 20 streams total)
