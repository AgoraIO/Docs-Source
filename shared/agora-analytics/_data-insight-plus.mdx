### Time series analysis

Above the analysis area on the Data Insights page is the time series analysis section, which displays the changes in indicators over time based on the selected conditions.

![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-timing-analysis.png)

Timing analysis includes the following functions:

* **Linkage with global filter conditions**: The data displayed in the time series analysis chart is generated according to the conditions set in the global filter.

* **Line chart interaction**

    You interact with the line chart in the following ways:

    * Hover over a data point to display the indicator-dimension group name, timestamp, and indicator value.
    
    * Click a data point to:
        * View hour-level data. Use this point as the data range granularity to switch to a one-hour view.
        * Perform dimensional decomposition. Initiate dimensional analysis with this data point.
        * Conduct data sampling. Start sampling analysis with this data point. Currently, only the audio freeze rate, video freeze rate, and network transmission delay rate support data sampling.

* **Auxiliary reference indicators**

    The quality experience indicators (success rate of joining channels, audio/video freeze rate, network delay rate) display additional auxiliary reference indicators below the sequence diagram to assist in assessing the validity of the data. Hovering the mouse over the auxiliary indicator column chart reveals the timestamp, indicator/dimension group name, and indicator value corresponding to that specific point in time.

### Dimensional analysis

The dimensional analysis area is located below the analysis area on the data insight page. It shows the distribution of selected indicators under each dimension.

![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-dimensional-analysis.png)

Dimensional analysis includes the following capabilities:

* **Dimension Time Picker** 

    * The dimension analysis area features an independent time selector that aligns with the selected time interval in the time series analysis area. It maintains the same time granularity as the data points in the time series analysis.
    * By default, when you select a time interval in the time series analysis chart, the dimension analysis displays the result for the last data point within that interval.
    * You have the flexibility to manually adjust the time using the dimension time selector. Additionally, clicking a data point in the time series analysis diagram and selecting **Dimension Decomposition** allows you to view the dimensional analysis results specific to that point.

* **Quick distribution**: After you select the main analysis indicator, the dimension analysis area displays several commonly used dimension distribution graphs of the indicator. The dimensions supported by each indicator are different. Explore the display methods of each dimension.

* **One-dimensional analysis**: In addition to the quick distribution, the analysis dimensions supported by the selected indicator are displayed on the left side of the dimensional analysis area. When you click a dimension, the analysis result list of this dimension is displayed on the right.

    ![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-individual-dimension-analysis.png)

* **Linkage with global filter conditions**: The charts in the quick distribution of dimensional analysis and the results of one-dimensional analysis are generated according to the filter conditions set in the global filter.

### Sampling analysis

Sampling analysis is only supported when video/audio freeze rate and network transmission delay rate are selected as the main analysis indicators. Click a data point in the time series analysis diagram of these three indicators, and select **Data Sampling** to sample and analyze the data point.

![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-sampling-analysis.png)

#### Indicator comparison

Indicator comparison allows you to analyze and compare the changing trends of different indicators within the same time period.

![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-index-comparison.png)

Consider the following when using this feature:

* You can select up to 3 indicators to compare with the main analysis indicators.
* When multiple indicators are selected and applied, the dimension global filter conditions will be cleared to initialize the comparison mode. You can then add dimension global filter conditions again.
* After selecting and applying multiple indicators, the time series analysis area will display a multi-indicator time series diagram. The dimension analysis area will present dimensional data corresponding to the selected multiple indicators for single-dimensional analysis.

#### Time comparison

Time comparison is utilized to compare the data performance and change trend of the same indicator across different time periods. 

![](https://agora-doc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/analytics/diplus-time-comparison.png)

The time comparison method supports the following selection modes:

    * **Comparison with the previous cycle**: Compares the data from the previous 14-day cycle. 
    * **Compare with last month**: Compares the data from the corresponding period in the previous month.
    * **Custom time**: Allows you to choose a comparison period based on your preference. The granularity is in days, and the number of days selected should match the current time period. 
    
Ensure that the start time of all comparison time periods does not precede the earliest query time permitted by your package.


#### Global comparison

Global comparison is used to compare the results of a certain indicator under dimensional conditions with global results. When using this method, please note that the global comparison only takes effect when the main analysis indicator is selected and the dimension filter condition is added.
