## Set up the environment

Set up the environment on your Linux server:
1. [Download](http://docs.agora.io/en/sdks?platform=linux) the Agora <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> for Linux package. The package structure is listed as follows:

    | Folder | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `bin` | The directory where AgoraCoreService is located. |
    | `include` | <ul><li>`base`: Required header files for developing the recording application.</li><li>`IAgoraLinuxSdkCommon.h`: Public structure and enumeration.</li><li>`IAgoraRecordingEngine.h`: Interface of the recording engine and its configuration.</li></ul> |
    | `libs` | Required libraries for developing the recording application. |
    | `samples` | Sample code: <ul><li>`agorasdk`: Demo that implements the C++ interface and callbacks.</li><li>`base`: Public sample code.</li><li>`cpp`: C++ sample code.<ul><li>`release/bin/recorder`: Parent process that can be run.</li></ul></li><li>`java`: Java sample code.<ul><li>`native`: Native code.</li><li>`native/jni`: JNI delegate.</li><li>`src`: Java code.</li><li>`src/io/agora/recording/RecordingEventHandler.java`: Callback interface class.</li><li>`src/io/agora/recording/RecordingSDK.java`: Recording interface class.</li></ul></li></ul> |
    | `tools` | Transcoding tools. |

2. Ensure that your compiler is GCC 4.4+.
3. Set up the Java Development Kit and ensure `jni.h` is included.
4. Set `CLASSPATH` in Java and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Linux.
5. If your firewall restricts access to the Agora services, use [cloud proxy service](../develop/cloud-proxy).

6. Open the UDP ports used by the recording processes. The UDP ports are the ports between the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters specified in `RecordingConfig`.

    <Admonition type="info">
    - Use the `iptables -L` command to check the UDP port.
    - To record the content in the channels, you need one recording process for each channel. A single recording process requires four UDP ports. There must be no port conflict among the processes, including the system processes and all recording processes.
    - Best practice is to specify the range of ports used by the recording processes. Configure a large range for all recording processes \(Agora recommends 40000 to 41000 or larger\). The <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> assigns ports to each recording process within the specified range and avoids port conflicts automatically. To set the port range, configure the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters.
    - If the `lowUdpPort` and `highUdpPort` parameters are not specified, random ports are used by the recording processes that may cause port conflicts.
    </Admonition>

7. For debugging purposes, enable core dump on your Linux system.


## Compile the sample code

1. Run the following command to pre-set the environment under the `samples/java` directory. Replace `jni_path` with the absolute path of the `jni.h` file. For example, `/usr/java8u161/jdk1.8.0_161/include/`ï¼š

   ```bash
   source build.sh pre_set jni_path
   ```

2. Execute the build script under the `samples/java` directory:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh build
   ```

After the compilation, a `librecording.so` file is generated in the `samples/java/bin/io/agora/recording` directory, as shown in the following figure.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1544522310646)

To start recording using the command line, see [Record a Call](record-cmd). If you want to call APIs, import the SDK files to your project.

## Import files

Import the following files to your project:

-  `librecording.so`
-  `AgoraCoreService`  in the `bin` folder
- All the Java files under `samples/java/src/io/agora/recording`
  - `RecordingEventHandler.java`
  - `RecordingSDK.java`
  - `/common/Common.java`
  - `/common/RecordingConfig.java`
  - `/common/RecordingEngineProperties.java`

For example, if the project root directory is  `ROOT_DIR`, you need to copy the `librecording.so` file to  `ROOT_DIR/lib`, copy the `AgoraCoreService` file to `ROOT_DIR/bin`, and copy the Java files to `ROOT_DIR/src/io/agora/recording`.

When running the Java project, set `-Djava.library.path=ROOT_DIR/lib`to specify the path to the dynamic library. Note that you need to set the `appliteDir` parameter as `ROOT_DIR/bin` in `RecordingConfig` when starting a recording.
