Metadata provides easy-to-use, serverless storage for user and channel data enabling you to build innovative, reliable, and scalable applications. Metadata support, built into the <Vpd k="SDK" />, enables you to create <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that are personalized, user-friendly, and secure. Use this feature to easily store data without the need to set up your own databases. <Vpd k="SDK" /> also triggers events when metadata is updated. Clients can receive these events in real-time and update their front-end accordingly.

You can leverage user and channel metadata in <Vpd k="NAME" /> apps to:

* **Personalize user profiles**: Create user profiles that include additional information such as the user's full name, a profile picture URL, geographic location, and availability status. 

* **Maintain chat history**: Store and display chat history, including timestamps and message status such as whether a message has been read or not. 

* **Maintain search history**: Enable users to quickly search for specific messages, users, or topics within the app. 

* **Notifications**: Enable users to customize their notification settings, such as choosing which channels to receive notifications for and setting custom alert tones. 

* **Security**: Enforce security measures, such as verifying user identity and encrypting messages. 

## Understand the tech

This section presents an overview of the steps required to integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> metadata features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the basic workflow you implement to read and write user and channel metadata:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequisites />

* Implemented the [<Vpd k="NAME" /> <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project.

## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vpd k="NAME" /> <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project you created previously.

<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to add <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> metadata features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.


## Implement use of metadata

In this example, after a user logs in to the <Vpd k="NAME" /> server, you clear any previous data and set fresh metadata for the local user in the form of key-value pairs. When the local user changes a value, you call the update method to save the new value. You show a list of all users currently in the channel. When a local user selects another user from the list, you retrieve and display their metadata. You subscribe to the metadata change event of remote users to be notified of updates.

This section shows how to implement this functionality into your <Vpd k="NAME"/> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.
