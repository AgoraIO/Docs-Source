        <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">

        <CodeBlock language="ruby">
        {`platform :ios, '9.0'
        target 'Your App' do
          # For x.y.z fill in the specific SDK version number, such as 4.4.0.
          # Integrate the Full SDK
          pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS', 'x.y.z'

          # To integrate the Lite SDK, use the following line instead
          # pod 'AgoraLite_iOS', '4.4.0'
        end`}
        </CodeBlock>

        </PlatformWrapper>

        <PlatformWrapper platform="macos">

        <CodeBlock language="ruby">
        {`platform :macos, '10.11'
        target 'Your App' do
