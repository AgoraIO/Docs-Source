### Create and Manage Projects

This page shows how to create a project, view project information, and manage app certificates in Agora Console.

#### Restrictions

-   If your account has multiple members, only those with the role of **Admin**, **Engineer**, or an authorized custom role have access to the **Project Management** page.

-   Each Agora account can create up to 20 projects. If you need to create more projects, contact Agora by [submitting a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/).

#### Create an Agora project

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1.  Enter the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Project Management</Link> page.

2.  Click **Create**.

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.

4.  Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Project Management** page.

#### View project information

For a project listed on the **Project Management** page, you can do the following:

-   View basic information, such as the stage, name, and creation date of the project.

-   Click the copy icon and to copy the <ProductWrapper notAllowed="broadcast-streaming" > <ProductWrapper notAllowed="on-premise-recording" > [App ID](../reference/glossary#app-id)</ProductWrapper> </ProductWrapper> <ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming"> App ID</ProductWrapper> of the project.

-   Click **Config** to enter the project detail page, where you can view and configure **App certificate**, **Project status**, and **Extensions**.

#### Manage app certificates

An app certificate is a string generated by Console to enable token authentication. For different security requirements, Agora provides the following app certificate options:

-   Primary certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for temporary use or production environments.

-   Secondary certificate: This certificate is used to generate tokens for production environments only and does not apply to RESTful APIs.

-   No certificate: This certificate appears only if you choose **APP ID** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project. In this case, you can complete authentication with the App ID only.

If you have both **No certificate** and **Primary/Secondary certificate** in your project, you can either complete authentication with the App ID only or use tokens generated by the **Primary/Secondary certificate** for authentication.

#### Enable the primary certificate

For high-security scenarios, enable the primary certificate as follows:

-   If you choose **APP ID + Token** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, the primary certificate is enabled by default. On the project detail page, you can click the the copy icon under **Primary certificate** to view and copy it.  In this case, you need to use the token generated by the **Primary certificate** for authentication.

-   If you choose **APP ID** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project, you need to enable the primary certificate manually. On the project detail page, click the switch under **Primary certificate** to enable it.

    Once the primary certificate is enabled, you can click the copy icon to view and copy it. In this case, you can either complete authentication with the App ID only or use tokens generated by the **Primary certificate** for authentication.

#### Enable the secondary certificate

If you need to change the primary certificate after enabling it, you can enable the secondary certificate.

On the project detail page, click the switch under **Secondary certificate**.

Once the secondary certificate is enabled, you can click the copy icon to view and copy it. In this case, both the primary and secondary certificate can be used to generate tokens for authentication.

#### Switch to a new primary certificate

If the primary certificate is exposed to security risks, you can use the secondary certificate as a new primary certificate and delete the original primary certificate.

To switch to a new primary certificate, follow these steps:

1.  [Enable the secondary certificate](#enable-the-secondary-certificate).

2.  On the project detail page, click **Set as primary** to the right of **Secondary certificate**. The secondary certificate and the primary certificate are switched.

3.  Click the switch under **Secondary certificate** to disable the current secondary certificate.

4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the status of the secondary certificate is updated to **Disabled**, and the **Delete** button appears.

5.  Click the **Delete** button.

6.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification. If verified successfully, the **Delete** button disappears, and the current secondary certificate (the original primary certificate) is deleted.

#### Delete the no certificate option

**No certificate** is enabled only if you choose **APP ID** as the authentication mechanism when creating a project. **No certificate** means that your project uses only the App ID for authentication, which is less secure.

To delete the no certificate option, follow these steps:

1.  [Enable the primary certificate](#enable-the-primary-certificate).

2.  Click the **Delete** button to the right of **No certificate**.

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification.
