### Manage the contact list

Use this section to understand how to send a contact invitation, listen for contact events, and accept or decline the contact invitation.

#### Send a contact invitation

Call `addContact` to add the specified user as a contact:

```javascript
let message = 'Hello!';
WebIM.conn.addContact('username', message);   
```

#### Listen for contact events

Use `connection.addEventHandler` to add the following callback events. When a user receives a contact invitation, you can accept or decline the invitation.

```javascript
/**
 * msg indicates the result of triggering the callback
 */
connection.addEventHandler('CONTACT', {
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is received
    onContactInvited: function(msg){},
    // Occurs when the contact is deleted
    onContactDeleted: function(msg){},
    // Occurs when a contact is added
    onContactAdded: function(msg){},
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is declined
    onContactRefuse: function(msg){}, 
    // Occurs when the contact invitation is approved
    onContactAgreed: function(msg){} 
})
```

#### Accept or decline the contact invitation

After receiving `onContactInvited`, call `acceptContactInvite` or `declineContactInvite` to accept or decline the invitation.

```javascript
/**
 * Accepts the contact invitation
 */
WebIM.conn.acceptContactInvite('username')

/**
 * Declines the contact invitation
 */
WebIM.conn.declineContactInvite('username')
```

#### Delete a contact

Call `deleteContact` to delete the specified contact. The deleted user receives the `onContactDeleted` callback.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.deleteContact('username');   
```

#### Retrieve the contact list

To get the contact list, you can call `getContacts`.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.getContacts().then( (res) => {
    console.log(res) // res.data > ['user1', 'user2']
}
```

### Manage the blocklist

You can add any other users to the blocklist, regardless of whether they are on the contact list or not. Contacts are still displayed on the contact list even if they are added to the blocklist. After adding users to the blocklist,  you can still send messages to them, but will not receive messages from them as they cannot send messages or friend requests to you.

#### Add a user to the blocklist

Call `addUsersToBlockList` to add the specified user to the blocklist.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.addUsersToBlocklist({
    name: ["user1", "user2"],
});
```


#### Remove a user from the blocklist

To remove the specified user from the blocklist, call `removeUserFromBlockList`.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.removeUserFromBlockList({
    name: ["user1", "user2"],
});
```

#### Retrieve the blocklist from the server

To get the blocklist, call `getBlocklist`.

```javascript
WebIM.conn.getBlocklist();
```
