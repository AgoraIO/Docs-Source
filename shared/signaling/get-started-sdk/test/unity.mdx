Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In your code, replace `your_appId` with your app ID from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and `your_userId` with a numeric string. 

1. Use the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/) to generate a <Vg k="SIG" /> token:

    1. Select Signaling from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
    1. Fill in your app ID and app certificate from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
    1. Click **Generate Token**. 
    1. In your code, replace `your_token` with the generated token.

1. Repeat the previous step to generate a stream channel token but this time also fill in the channel name with the value for `stChannelName` and the User ID with the value for `userId` from your code. Use the generated token to replace `your_RTC_token` in your code.

1. In the Unity Editor, mount the event handling functions defined in the code to the corresponding Button components.

1. In Unity, click **Play**. You see the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> running on your device.

1. Run another instance of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with the same `appId` but a different `userId` and tokens.

1. In either <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance, type a message in the input box under **Send string message to message channel** and and press **Send Message**.

    You see the message displayed in the other <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> instance.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
