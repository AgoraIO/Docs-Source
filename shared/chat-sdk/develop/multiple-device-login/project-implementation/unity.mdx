### Get the login ID list of other logged-in devices of the current user

Call `GetSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform` to get the login ID list of other logged-in devices, and then select the target login ID as the message recipient to send a message to the specified device.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ContactManager.GetSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform(new ValueCallBack<List<string>>(
    onSuccess: (list) =>
    {
        // Select a login ID as the message recipient.
        string toChatUserId = list[0];
        string content = "content";
        // Create a text message, content is the message text, toChatUserId passes the login ID as the message recipient.
        Message msg = Message.CreateTextSendMessage(toChatUserId, content);
        // Send a message.
        SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.SendMessage(ref msg, new CallBack(
            onSuccess: () => {

            },
            onProgress: (progress) => {

            },
            onError: (code, desc) => {

            }
        ));
},
onError: (code, desc) => {

}
));
```

### Get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account

Call `GetLoggedInDevicesFromServerWithToken` to get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account from the server by passing in the user ID and user token.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.GetLoggedInDevicesFromServerWithToken(userId, token,
callback: new ValueCallBack<List<DeviceInfo>>(

onSuccess: (list) =>
{

},

onError: (code, desc) =>
{

}
)
);
```

### Force the specified account to log off from a single device

Call `KickDeviceWithToken` to pass in the user ID and user token to kick the specified account off from a single logged-in device. Before calling this method, obtain the device ID through the `SDKClient#GetLoggedInDevicesFromServer` and `DeviceInfo#Resource` methods.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">You can also use this interface without logging in.</Admonition>

```csharp
// userId: user ID, token: user token.
SDKClient.Instance.GetLoggedInDevicesFromServerWithToken(userId, token,
callback: new ValueCallBack<List<DeviceInfo>>(

onSuccess: (list) =>
{

},

onError: (code, desc) =>
{

}
)
);

SDKClient.Instance.KickDeviceWithToken(userId, token, resource,
callback: new CallBack(

onSuccess: () =>
{

},

onError: (code, desc) =>
{

}
)
);
```

### Force the specified account to log off from all devices

Call `KickAllDevicesWithToken` to kick the specified account off from all logged-in devices by passing in the user ID and user token.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">You can also use this interface without logging in.</Admonition>

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.KickAllDevicesWithToken(username, token,
callback: new CallBack(

onSuccess: () =>
{

},

onError: (code, desc) =>
{

}
)
);

```

### Get operations on other devices

Let's say that account A logs in on devices A and B at the same time and performs operations on device A. Device B will receive notifications corresponding to these operations.

You need to implement `IMultiDeviceDelegate` to listen to operations on other devices, and then set up multi-device listeners.

```csharp
//Inherit and implement IMultiDeviceDelegate.
public class MultiDeviceDelegate : IMultiDeviceDelegate {
public void onContactMultiDevicesEvent(MultiDevicesOperation operation, string target, string ext) {
......
switch (operation) {
//The current user deletes friends on other devices.
case CONTACT_REMOVE:
//The current user accepts friend requests on other devices.
break;
case CONTACT_ACCEPT:
//The current user rejects friend requests on other devices.
break;
case CONTACT_DECLINE:
//The current user adds someone to the blacklist on other devices.
break;
case CONTACT_BAN:
//The current user removes a user from the blacklist on other devices.
break;
case CONTACT_ALLOW:
break;
}
}

public void onGroupMultiDevicesEvent(MultiDevicesOperation operation, string target, List<string> usernames) {
......
switch (operation) {
//The current user created a group on another device.
case GROUP_CREATE:
break;
//The current user destroyed the group on another device.
case GROUP_DESTROY:
break;
//The current user joined the group on another device.
case GROUP_JOIN:
break;
//The current user left the group on another device.
case GROUP_LEAVE:
break;
//The current user initiated a group application on another device.
case GROUP_APPLY:
break;
//The current user approved the group application on another device.
case GROUP_APPLY_ACCEPT:
break;
//The current user rejected the group application on another device.
case GROUP_APPLY_DECLINE:
break;
//The current user invited group members on other devices.
case GROUP_INVITE:
break;
//The current user agreed to the group invitation on other devices.
case GROUP_INVITE_ACCEPT:
break;
//The current user rejected the group invitation on other devices.
case GROUP_INVITE_DECLINE:
break;
//The current user kicked someone out of the group on other devices.
case GROUP_KICK:
break;
//The current user added members to the group blacklist on other devices.
case GROUP_BAN:
break;
//The current user removed members from the group blacklist on other devices.
case GROUP_ALLOW:
break;
//The current user blocked the group on other devices.
case GROUP_BLOCK:
break;
//The current user unblocked the group on other devices.
case GROUP_UNBLOCK:
break;
//The current user transferred the group owner on other devices.
case GROUP_ASSIGN_OWNER:
break;
//The current user adds an administrator on other devices.
case GROUP_ADD_ADMIN:
break;
//The current user removes the administrator on other devices.
case GROUP_REMOVE_ADMIN:
break;
//The current user mutes users on other devices.
case GROUP_ADD_MUTE:
break;
//The current user removes the muting on other devices.
case GROUP_REMOVE_MUTE:
break;
default:
break;
}
......
}
}

//Register listener.
MultiDeviceDelegate adelegate = new MultiDeviceDelegate();
SDKClient.Instance.AddMultiDeviceDelegate(adelegate);

//Remove listener.
SDKClient.Instance.DeleteMultiDeviceDelegate(adelegate);
```
