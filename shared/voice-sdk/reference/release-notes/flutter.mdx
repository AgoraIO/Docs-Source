   | `MediaPlayerError`        | `MediaPlayerReason`           |
   | `RtmpStreamPublishErrorType`  | `RtmpStreamPublishReason`     |

   **Note:** For specific renaming of enumerations, please refer to [API changes](#api-changes).

1. **Channel media relay**

   To improve interface usability, this release removes some methods and callbacks for channel media relay. Use the alternative options listed in the table below:

   | Deleted methods and callbacks                         | Alternative methods and callbacks  |
   | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelay`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelay`</li></ul>     | `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`   |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelayEx`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelayEx`</li></ul> | `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` |
   | `onChannelMediaRelayEvent`                            | `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged`  |

1. **Audio route**

   Starting with this release, `routeBluetooth` in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/enum_audioroute.html">AudioRoute</Link> is renamed to `routeHeadsetbluetooth`, representing a Bluetooth device using the HFP protocol. `routeBluetoothSpeaker`(10) is added to represent a Bluetooth device using the A2DP protocol.


1. **Audio loopback capturing (Windows, macOS)**

   - Before v6.3.0, if you call the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_disableaudio">disableAudio</Link> method to disable the audio module, audio loopback capturing will not be disabled.
   - As of v6.3.0, if you call the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_disableaudio">disableAudio</Link> method to disable the audio module, audio loopback capturing will be disabled as well. If you need to enable audio loopback capturing, you need to enable the audio module by calling the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enableaudio">enableAudio</Link> method and then call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enableloopbackrecording">enableLoopbackRecording</Link>.

#### New features

1. **Local preview with multiple views**

   This release supports local preview with simultaneous display of multiple frames, where the videos shown in the frames are positioned at different observation positions along the video link. Examples of usage are as follows:

   1. Call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setuplocalvideo">setupLocalVideo</Link> to set the first view: Set the `position` parameter to `positionPostCapturerOrigin` (introduced in this release) in `VideoCanvas`. This corresponds to the position after local video capture and before preprocessing. The video observed here does not have preprocessing effects.
   1. Call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setuplocalvideo">setupLocalVideo</Link> to set the second view: Set the `position` parameter to `positionPostCapturer` in `VideoCanvas`, the video observed here has the effect of video preprocessing.
   1. Observe the local preview effect: The first view is the original video of a real person; the second view is the virtual portrait after video preprocessing (including image enhancement, virtual background, and local preview of watermarks) effects.

1. **Query device score**

   This release adds the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_querydevicescore">queryDeviceScore</Link> method to query the device's score level to ensure that the user-set parameters do not exceed the device's capabilities. For example, in HD or UHD video scenarios, you can first call this method to query the device's score. If the returned score is low (for example, below 60), you need to lower the video resolution to avoid affecting the video experience. The minimum device score required for different business scenarios is varied. For specific score recommendations, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

1. **Select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming**

   This release introduces the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_Imediaplayer_selectmultiaudiotrack">selectMultiAudioTrack</Link> method that allows you to select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming to remote users. For example, in scenarios like online karaoke, the host can choose to play the original sound locally and publish the accompaniment in the channel. Before using this function, you need to open the media file through the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_imediaplayer.html#api_imediaplayer_openwithmediasource">openWithMediaSource</Link> method and enable this function by setting the `enableMultiAudioTrack` parameter in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_mediasource.html">MediaSource</Link>.

1. **Others**

   This release has passed the test verification of the following APIs and can be applied to the entire series of RTC 4.x SDK.

   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengineeventhandler.html#callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onremotesubscribefallbacktoaudioonly">onRemoteSubscribeFallbackToAudioOnly</Link>: Occurs when the subscribed video stream falls back to audio-only stream due to weak network conditions or switches back to the video stream after the network conditions improve.
   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_FLUTTER_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_iaudiodevicemanager.html#api_iaudiodevicemanager_setplaybackdevicevolume">setPlaybackDeviceVolume</Link> (Windows): Sets the volume of the audio playback device.

- When using an iOS 16 or later device with Bluetooth headphones connected before joining the channel, the audio routing after joining the channel was not as expected: Audio was played from the speaker, not the Bluetooth headphones (iOS).

### v6.2.4

v6.2.4 was released on October 25, 2023.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issue:

The `AgoraRtcWrapper` version number in `CFBundleShortVersionString` on iOS and macOS is wrong, which interferes with submitting the App to the App Store.

### v6.2.3

v6.2.3 was released on October 20, 2023.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the logic of Token parsing, in order to prevent an app from crashing when an invalid token is passed in.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes when joining a channel on macOS.
- Occasional failure of joining a channel when the local system time was not set correctly.
- When calling the `playEffect` method to play two audio files using the same `soundId`, the first audio file was sometimes played repeatedly.
- When the host called the `startAudioMixing` method to play music, sometimes the host couldn't hear the music while the remote users could hear it on Android.
- Occasional crashes occurred on certain Android devices.
- In channels joined by calling `joinChannelEx` exclusively, calling `setEnableSpeakerphone` did not result in switching audio route from the speaker to the headphone on Android.

#### API changes

**Added**

- The following enumerations in `onLocalVideoStateChanged` on Windows and macOS:
  - `localVideoStreamErrorScreenCapturePaused`
  - `localVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureResumed`
  - `localVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureWindowHidden`

### v6.2.2

v6.2.2 was released on August 1, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user id. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can avoid repeated application of tokens every time users joining a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

   <div class="alert note">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</div>

2. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannel` and `preloadChannelWithUserAccount` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shortening the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to avoid repeated application of tokens every time you joining a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

#### Improvements

1. **Channel media relay**

   The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

This release includes the following additional improvements:

1. To improve the switching experience between multiple audio routes, this release adds the `setRouteInCommunicationMode` method. This method can switch the audio route from a Bluetooth headphone to the earpiece, wired headphone or speaker in communication volume mode ([`MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioManager?hl=en#mode_in_communication)). (Android)

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, noise occurred when the local user listened to their own and remote audio after joining the channel. (macOS)
- Slow channel reconnection after the connection was interrupted due to network reasons.
- In multi-device audio recording scenarios, after repeatedly plugging and unplugging or enabling/disabling the audio recording device, no sound could be heard occasionally when calling the `startRecordingDeviceTest` to start an audio capturing device test. (Windows)

#### API changes

**Added**

- `preloadChannel`
- `preloadChannelWithUserAccount`
- `updatePreloadChannelToken`
- `setRouteInCommunicationMode` (Android)


### v6.2.1

This version was released on June 21, 2023.

#### Improvements

This version improves the network transmission strategy, enhancing the smoothness of audio interactions.

#### Issues fixed

This version fixed the following issues:
- Inability to join channels caused by SDK's incompatibility with some older versions of AccessToken.
- After the sending end called `setAINSMode` to activate AI noise reduction, occasional echo was observed by the receiving end.
- Brief noise occurred while playing media files using the media player.
- Occasional crash after calling the `destroyMediaPlayer` method. (iOS)


### v6.2.0

v6.2.0 was released on May 29, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `ChannelMediaOptions` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` in `ChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**2. Miscellaneous**

- `onApiCallExecuted` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- The `IAudioFrameObserver` class is renamed to `IAudioPcmFrameSink`, thus the prototypes of the following methods are updated accordingly:
    - `onFrame`
    - `registerAudioFrameObserver` and `unregisterAudioFrameObserver` in `MediaPlayer`
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.


#### New features

**1. AI Noise Suppression**

This release introduces public APIs for the AI Noise Suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise reduction mode as balance, aggressive, or low latency according to your scenarios.

<div class="alert note">Agora charges separately for this function. See [AI Noise Suppression unit pricing](pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).</div>

**2. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `getNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.

**3. Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio frames, which can speed up the first audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.


#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Improved compatibility with audio file types (Android)**

As of this release, you can use the following methods to open files with a URI starting with `content://`:
- `startAudioMixing`
- `playEffect`
- `openWithMediaSource`

**3. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**4. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes occurred on Android devices when users joining or leaving a channel (Android).
- When the host frequently switched the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members could not hear the audio of the host.
- Occasional failure when enabling in-ear monitoring (Android).
- Occasional echo (Android).
- Abnormal client status caused by an exception in the `onRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback (Android, iOS).
- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.
- In real-time chorus scenarios, remote users heard noises and echoes when an OPPO R11 device joined the channel in the loudspeaker mode  (Android).
- When the playback of the local music finished, the `onAudioMixingFinished` callback was not properly triggered (Android).
- At the moment when a user left a channel, a request for leaving was not sent to the server and the leaving behavior was incorrectly determined by the server as timed out.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `getNtpWallTimeInMs`
- `setAINSMode`
- `createAudioCustomTrack`
- `destroyAudioCustomTrack`
- `AudioTrackConfig`
- `AudioAinsMode`
- `AudioTrackType`
- The `domainLimit` and `autoRegisterAgoraExtensions` members in `RtcEngineContext`
- `enableInstantMediaRendering`

**Deprecated**

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `startChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `onChannelMediaRelayEvent`
- `ChannelMediaRelayEvent`

**Deleted**

- `onApiCallExecuted`
- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `ChannelMediaOptions` in `ChannelMediaOptions`

### v6.1.0

v6.1.0 was released on December 20, 2022.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

After successfully enabling the in-ear monitoring function, you can call `registerAudioFrameObserver` to register the audio observer, and the SDK triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback to report the audio frame data. You can use your own audio effect processing module to preprocess the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. Agora recommends that you call the `setEarMonitoringAudioFrameParameters` method to set the audio data format of in-ear monitoring. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the parameters in this method and triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.

To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call `setInEarMonitoringVolume`.


**2. Audio capture device test (Android)**

This release adds support for testing local audio capture devices before joining a channel. You can call `startRecordingDeviceTest` to start the audio capture device test. After the test is complete, call the `stopPlaybackDeviceTest` method to stop the audio capture device test.


**3. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the
`getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use.
The available values are `UNKNOWN`, `DISCONNECTED`, `LAN`, `WIFI`, `2G`, `3G`, `4G`, and `5G`.
When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `onNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report
the current network connection type.

**4. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports the three audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Agora also supports publishers in choosing whether the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered bypass this filter mechanism and are transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios with a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reduce the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

<div class="alert info">To enable this function, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io/">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

**5. Loopback device (Windows)**

The SDK uses the playback device as the loopback device by default. As of 6.1.0, you can specify a loopback device separately and publish the captured audio to the remote end.

- `setLoopbackDevice`: Specifies the loopback device. If you do not want the current playback device to be the loopback device, you can call this method to specify another device as the loopback device.
- `getLoopbackDevice`: Gets the current loopback device.
- `followSystemLoopbackDevice`: Whether the loopback device follows the default playback device of the system.


**6. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense-of-presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listener experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation` respectively, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation parameter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enableDoppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`. The receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the audio experience for users with headphones.


**7. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.



**8. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

<div class="alert info">To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:sales@agora.io">sales@agora.io</a>.</div>


**9. Register extensions (Windows)**

This release adds the `registerExtension` method for registering extensions. When using a third-party extension, you need to call the extension-related APIs in the following order:

`loadExtensionProvider` -> `registerExtension` -> `setExtensionProviderProperty` -> `enableExtension`


**10. Device management (Windows, macOS)**

This release adds a series of callbacks to help you better understand the status of your audio devices:

- `onAudioDeviceStateChanged`: Occurs when the status of the audio device changes.
- `onAudioDeviceVolumeChanged`: Occurs when the volume of an audio device or app changes.


**11. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel-related methods that you can call to manage audio streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` method is used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio stream.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` method is used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio streams.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `options` parameter in the `leaveChannelEx` method is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.


**12. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `onClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `audienceLatencyLevelLowLatency (1)`: Low latency.
- `audienceLatencyLevelUltraLowLatency (2)`: Ultra-low latency.



#### Improvements


**1. Bluetooth permissions (Android)**

To simplify integration, as of this release, you can use the SDK to enable Android users to use Bluetooth normally without adding the `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission.


**2. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v6.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `relayEventPacketUpdateDestChannelRefused (8)`, and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v6.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.


**3. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.


**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `audioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.



#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issues:

**All**
- When entering a live streaming room that has been played for a long time as an audience, the time for the first frame to be rendered was shortened.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.


**Android**
- In online meeting scenarios, the local user and the remote user occasionally could not hear each other after the local user was interrupted by a call.

### v<Vg k = "VSDK_FLUTTER_LATEST_RELEASE"/>

v<Vg k = "VSDK_FLUTTER_LATEST_RELEASE"/> was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

This release changed SDK package name from `agora_rtc_ng` to `agora_rtc_engine`, and optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v<Vg k = "VSDK_FLUTTER_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/> The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Error codes and warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to the business scenarios. See [Migration guide](../develop/migration-guide) for details.

#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `RtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions`.

- After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).


**2. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `MediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio streams being played with remote users.

- Plays local and online media files.
- Preloads media files.
- Changes the CDN route for playing media files according your network conditions.
- Shares the audio streams being played with remote users.
- Caches data when playing media files.


3. **Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

    The SDK supports a new version of Noise Suppression (versus the basic AI Noise Suppression in agora_rtc_engine: ^5.x). Compared to the previous Noise Suppression, the new AI Noise Suppression has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and add the Dereverberation capability. To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io).


**4. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make audios sound clearer and stay true to the original sound of audio files, this release adds the `ultraHighQualityVoice` enumeration. In scenarios that involve human voices, such as chatting or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.


**5. Spatial audio**

> **_NOTE:_** This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact <a href= "mailto:sales-us@agora.io">sales-us@agora.io</a>. Contact Technical Support if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio of the remote user.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/video-call-spatial.png)

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.
![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/spatial-audio-effect.png)


**6. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `audioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AudioScenarioType`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.


**7. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to subscribe to the audio of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio sources.


**8. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio streams. You can add the user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or in your blocklist if you do not want to subscribe to. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `RtcEngineEx` interface.

- `setSubscribeAudioBlacklist`: Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeAudioWhitelist`: Set the audio subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.


**9. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `setAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AudioScenarioDefault` to `AudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.


#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannel` in agora_rtc_engine: ^5.x through the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `switchChannel` method.

**2. Voice pitch of the local user**

This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.
