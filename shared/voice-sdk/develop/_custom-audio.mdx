By default, <Vpd k="SDK" /> uses the standard audio module on the device your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> runs on. However, there are certain scenarios where you want to integrate a custom audio source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as:

* Your app has its own audio module.
* You want to use a non-microphone source, such as recorded audio data.
* You need to process the captured audio with a pre-processing library for audio enhancement.
* You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

## Understand the tech

To set an external audio source, you configure the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> before joining a channel. To manage the capture and processing of audio frames, you use methods from outside the <Vpd k="SDK" /> that are specific to your custom source. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to push processed audio data to subscribers in a channel.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to stream a custom audio source in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to integrate custom audio in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.

## Implement a custom audio source

To stream audio from a custom source, you convert the data stream into a suitable format and push this data using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

<ProjectImplement/>

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented streaming from a custom audio source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
