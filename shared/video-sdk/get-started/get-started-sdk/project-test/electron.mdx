Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Update the `APPID`, `token`, and `channel` parameter values in your code. 

1. In the project root directory run the following command in Terminal:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    After the project runs successfully, you see a pop-up window showing the local video.

1. Invite a friend to run the demo app on a second device. Use the same `APPID` and `channel` name to join.

    After your friend joins successfully, you can hear and see each other.
