Agora's notification server can inform your server of events that occurred in Agora's other servers for various functions through HTTP or HTTPS requests.

## Working principle

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1585759402952)

## Enable the service

Contact  [Agora Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io) to configure and enable the message notification service. Refer to [Message Notification Service](https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/AgoraPlatform/ncs) for details of **Data Format for Message Notification Callback**.

## HTTP/HTTPS request

Agora's notification server sends requests to your server by the POST method. The data structure is in JSON format. The character encoding is UTF-8. 


### Request header

`Content-Type`: `application/json`
`Agora-Signature`: The signature

To ensure that the communication between Agora's notification server and your server is secure, it is required to verify the signature when using the notification service.

### Request body

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|   `noticeId`    |  String    |      The notification ID to identify the notification for each event that occurred in the <Vg k="MPUSH" /> function.       |
|    `productId`   |  `productId`    |    The ID of the function. Here is `4`: **Cloud Player**         |
|   `eventType`    |  Number    |    The Unix timestamp (ms) when Agora's notification server sends the notification to your server. If you enable the **Retry** option, this value updates each time when it retries to send the notification.          |
|    `payload`    |    JSON Object   |     The notification payload to describe the detailed information for the event.          |
|    `appId`   |  String    |      The [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameappidaapp-id) provided by Agora when you create a **project** in Agora Console. The App ID identifies each project.        |

### Events for the Message Notification

#### **Player Created**

When you succeed in creating a cloud player by the `Create` API, Agora's notification server sends a notification for this event to your server.

The `eventType` is `1(Player Created)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
  "player": {
    "channelName": "class32",
    "createTs": 1575508644,
    "id": "2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
    "idleTimeout": 300,
    "name": "teacher101",
    "streamUrl": "rtmp://example.agora.io/live/class32/teacher101",
    "token": "2a784467d6",
    "uid": 101,
    "status": "connecting"
  },
  "lts": 1575508644149,
  "xRequestId": "7bbcc8a4acce48c78b53c5a261a8a564"
}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields: 
  - `channelName`: String. The name of the Agora channel.
  - `createTs`: Number. The Unix timestamp (in seconds) when creating the cloud player.
  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `idleTimeout`: Number. The maximum length of time (in seconds) that the cloud player is idle. The "idle" state means that the media stream is not playing. When the idle state exceeds `idleTimeout`, the cloud player is automatically destroyed.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
  - `streamUrl`: String. The RTMP URL of the online media stream.
  - `token`: String. The authentication token used by the cloud player in the channel.
  - `uid`: Number. The User ID of the cloud player in the channel.
  - `account`: String. The User Account of the cloud player in the Agora channel.
  - `status`: String. The state of the cloud player at runtime:
    - `"connecting"`: Agora's server is connecting to the address of the media stream or detecting the audio and video data.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `xRequestId`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify this request. It is the same as the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header. 

#### **Player Destroyed**

When the cloud player is destroyed, Agora's notification server sends a notification for this event to your server.

> For the destruction reason, see the `destroyReason` field.

The `eventType` is `3(Player Destroyed)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
  "player": {
    "channelName": "class32",
    "id": "2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
    "name": "teacher101"
  },
  "lts": 1575508666666,
  "destroyReason": "Delete Request",
  "fields": "player.name,player.channelName,player.id"
}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields: 
  - `channelName`: String. The name of the Agora channel.
  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `destroyReason`: String. The reason why the cloud player is destroyed:
  - `Delete Request`: You call the `Delete` API to successfully destroy the cloud player.
  - `Internal Error`: The error occurs when setting the parameters and fields related to the Agora channel, such as the `token` is invalid or expires.
  - `Idle Timeout`: Within the specified `idleTimeout`, Agora's server for the cloud player function cannot connect the address of the media stream or the media stream cannot be played.
  - `Stream Stopped`: Media stream playback ends.
- `fields`: String. The field mask to represent a set of symbolic field paths. The field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are separated by a comma. It specifies a subset of fields that should be returned. In the sample code, `fields` specifies to return the `name`, `channelName`, and `id` fields. For details, see [Google protobuf FieldMask](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/pubsub/latest/google.protobuf.html#.FieldMask).

#### **Player Status Changed**

When the state of the cloud player at runtime changes, Agora's notification server sends a notification for this event to your server.

The `eventType` is `4(Player Status Changed)`. The `payload` contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
  "player": {
    "channelName": "class32",
    "id": "2a784467d647bb87b60b719f6fa56317",
    "name": "teacher101",
    "status": "running"
  },
  "lts": 1575508645000,
  "fields": "player.name,player.channelName,player.id,player.status"
}
```

- `player`: JSON Object. Contains the following fields:  
  - `channelName`: String. The name of the Agora channel.
  - `id`: String. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the cloud player created. It is the ID of the cloud player.
  - `name`: String. The name of the cloud player.
  - `status`: String. The state of the cloud player at runtime:
    - `"connecting"`: Agora server for the cloud player function is connecting to the address of the media stream or detecting the audio and video data.
    - `"success"`: Agora server is successfully connected to the address of the media stream.
    - `"running"`: Playing.
    - `"failed"`: Agora's server cannot connect to the address of the media stream, or the media stream cannot be played.
    - `stopped`: Media stream playback ends.
- `lts`: Number. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurs in Agora's server for the cloud player function.
- `fields`ï¼šString. The field mask to represent a set of symbolic field paths. The field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are separated by a comma. It specifies a subset of fields that should be returned. In the sample code,`fields` specifies to return the `name`, `channelName`, `id` and `status` fields.
