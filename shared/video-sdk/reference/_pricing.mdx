- Top-up minutes remain valid for one year.
- You can apply top-up to any package, including the Free package.

If you purchase a top-up package, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> automatically deducts excess minutes from it when your usage exceeds the minutes in the subscribed package.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- If you purchase a top-up package before the 1st of a month, the package covers usage from the previous month  
- <Vg k="COMPANY" /> deducts usage on the 6th of each month.  
  - From the 1st to the 6th day: Console shows remaining balance after last month’s settlement.  
  - From the 7th day onwards: Console shows balance after current month’s deduction.
</Admonition>

#### Monthly postpaid billing

If your actual usage for the month exceeds both the subscribed package minutes and the minutes in the top-up package, <Vg k="COMPANY" />:

* Converts the overage use into Standard minutes
* Charges $0.99 per 1,000 Standard minutes at the time of settlement

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
- Ensure your account has sufficient balance to prevent service interruption due to non-payment.
- To switch to postpaid billing, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io). Postpaid billing requires a minimum monthly usage.
</Admonition>

### Billing example

User A purchases the Premium Package on August 15, 2025.

* **August 15**: On purchase, User A pays:  
  *$339.99* for the month of August.
* **August 25**: The package is automatically renewed for September.  
  *$339.99* is deducted from the balance.
* **September 1**: August usage exceeds the package minutes by 100,000.  
  *100,000 ÷ 1,000 × $0.99 = $99* is automatically deducted from your account.

## Value-added services

Use of <Vg k="VSDK"/> value-added services may incur costs in addition to basic service charges.

### Local screenshot upload

The [Local screenshot upload](../advanced-features/screenshot-upload) feature captures video stream screenshots in a channel at set intervals and uploads them to a specified third-party cloud storage service.

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> charges local screenshot upload based on two metrics:

* **Screenshot fee**
* **QPS overage fee** (queries per second)

At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates:

* The total number of screenshots generated
* The monthly peak QPS if it exceeds the free quota

**Billing formula:**

```md
Monthly fee = (Number of screenshots - free quota) × Screenshot unit price
            + (Monthly peak QPS - free QPS) × QPS overage unit price
```

#### Pricing

| Billing Type       | Unit Price               | Discount Policy            |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Screenshot Fee     | $0.30 per 10,000 images  | First 10,000 images per month are free |
| QPS Overage Fee    | $1.5 per QPS           | Includes 500 QPS per month: <li> ≤ 500 QPS: No charge </li> <li> > 500 QPS: Charged based on monthly peak QPS </li>|

* **Example 1:**
  A project generates **910,000 screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **100**
  
  - Screenshots: 910,000 - 10,000 (free) = 900,000 billable images
  - Screenshot fee: 900,000 ÷ 10,000 × $0.30 = **$27.00**
  - QPS fee: 100 ≤ 500 (free), so **$0**
  - **Total fee = $27.00**

* **Example 2:**
  A project generates **2.91 million screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **600**
  
  - Screenshots: 2,910,000 - 10,000 (free) = 2,900,000 billable images  
  - Screenshot fee: 2,900,000 ÷ 10,000 × $0.30 = **$87.00**
  - QPS fee: (600 - 500) × $1.5 = **$150.00**
  - **Total fee = $237.00**

### Aggregate resolution

Aggregate resolution refers to the total resolution of all video streams subscribed to by a user.

The following table shows how a usage tier is applied based on aggregate resolution.

| Subscription Type | Aggregate Resolution                            | Usage Tier    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Audio Only        | –                                                      | Audio         |
| Video             | ≤ 921,600 (For example, 1280 × 720)                    | HD Video      |
| Video             | 921,600 < res ≤ 2,073,600 (For example, 1920 × 1080)   | Full HD Video |
| Video             | 2,073,600 < res ≤ 3,686,400 (For example, 2560 × 1440) | 2K Video      |
| Video             | > 3,686,400                                            | 2K+ Video     |

**Example**:

A user subscribes to the following streams:
    * *1280 × 720*
    * *1920 × 1080*

The aggregate resolution is: *1280 × 720 + 1920 × 1080 = 2,995,200*
The usage is billed as **2K video** .

### Standard duration calculation

Standard duration is used for unified billing and is calculated using the following formula:

*Standard Duration = Usage Time × Conversion Coefficient*

| Role                    | Audio | HD Video | Full HD | 2K | 2K+ |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | -- | --- |
| Host                  | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Interactive Live Audience | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Speed Live Audience       | 0.57  | 2        | 4.57    | 8  | 18  |

When actual usage is converted to standard duration, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates the total at the second level and rounds up the final result to the nearest whole number (minute).

**Example:**

* The host’s HD video usage is 60 seconds
  → Standard duration: *60 × 4 = 240 seconds*
* The audience’s audio usage is 360 seconds
  → Standard duration: *360 × 0.57 = 205.2 seconds*
* **Total:** *240 + 205.2 = 445.2 seconds = 7.42 minutes → Final billed: 8 minutes*

<Admonition type="info" >
This example is for illustrative purposes only. The actual billed duration is based on your project’s monthly report.

### FAQs

This section answers common billing-related questions.

#### Free minutes

<details>
<summary>If I purchase a paid package, do I still get 10,000 free minutes each month?</summary>

**Answer**: No. You won't get additional 10,000 free minutes

When you purchase a paid package, the free minutes are reflected in the package price through discounts. Higher-tier packages offer more free minutes. The 10,000 free minutes per month do not apply to paid packages.

</details>

#### Billing
<details>
<summary>If a user doesn’t publish or subscribe to any audio or video streams in a channel, will they still be charged?</summary>

**Answer**:
Yes. The audio subscription fees will apply.

Even if a user does not actively subscribe to any streams, audio usage time is still generated in the channel, which results in audio subscription fees. There is no charge for publishing audio or video streams.
</details>

#### Duration and usage
<details>
<summary>How is usage duration calculated in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**:

Agora tracks usage in seconds and then converts it to minutes for billing. At the end of each month, it calculates the total audio and video usage in seconds, divides each by 60, and rounds up to the nearest whole minute.

For example:

* If you use 59 seconds of audio, it is billed as **1 minute**.
* If you use 61 seconds of video, it is billed as **2 minutes**.

The rounding error per month is within **1 minute**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I view individual user usage in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**: No.

The bill only shows the total audio and video usage for all users across all projects under your Agora developer account.

To check usage for an individual user, use the statistics reported by the SDK:

* **Android:** `onRtcStats` callback → `totalDuration` property
* **iOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **Windows:** `onRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **macOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property

<Admonition type="Note" >
If a client disconnects due to poor network connection, the call duration reported by the SDK might be inaccurate.
To improve accuracy, implement a heartbeat mechanism using the Agora Signaling SDK or another signaling system. Subtract the disconnection time from the RTC-reported duration to get a more precise call duration for the user.
</Admonition>
</details>

#### Video resolution

<details>
<summary>Why is my applied billing rate for Ultra-HD when all users subscribe to 360 × 640 video streams?</summary>

**Answer**:

Billing is based on the aggregate resolution, which is the total resolution of all subscribed video streams combined.

Even if each individual stream is **360 × 640**, subscribing to multiple streams can cause the aggregate resolution to exceed **1,280 × 720**, which qualifies as Ultra-HD (UHD) under Agora’s billing rules.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How is video stream resolution calculated in dual-stream mode?</summary>

**Answer**:

In dual-stream mode, a user's video resolution is calculated based on the type of stream received:

* If subscribed to the high-quality (large) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the resolution set by the sender.
* If subscribed to the low-quality (small) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the actual resolution received.
* If the high-quality stream is requested but the low-quality stream is delivered, for example, due to a poor network, the resolution is still calculated based on the actual resolution of the stream received.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How can I determine the resolution of a screen sharing video stream?</summary>

**Answer**:

The resolution of a screen sharing video stream is determined by the video resolution you set in the relevant API or class. If no resolution is specified, the default resolution is used for billing.

| **Platform** | **Class or Configuration**                 | **Default Resolution** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Android      | `ScreenCaptureParameters`                  | 1280 × 720             |
| iOS          | `AgoraScreenCaptureParameters2`            | 1280 × 720             |
| Windows      | `ScreenCaptureParameters`                  | 1920 × 1080            |
| macOS        | `AgoraScreenCaptureParameters`             | 1920 × 1080            |
| Web          | `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig.encoderConfig` | 1920 × 1080            |

<Admonition type="info" >
On the Web platform, some browsers may not support the resolution you set due to device and browser limitations. In such cases, billing is based on the actual captured resolution, not the configured value.
</Admonition>

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is resolution calibration?</summary>

**Answer**:

Resolution calibration refers to adjusting the resolution of a video stream to a standard value when calculating aggregate resolution.

For example, a video stream with a resolution of **640 × 352** (225,280 pixels) is rounded up and treated as **640 × 360** (230,400 pixels) for billing purposes.

</details>

#### Arrears

<details>
<summary>What should I do if my account is frozen due to outstanding balance?</summary>

**Answer**:

If your account is frozen, recharge it promptly. Once your balance meets or exceeds the minimum required amount, the account will be automatically unfrozen.

To avoid service interruptions, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends monitoring deduction emails, recharge reminders, and account freeze warnings.
