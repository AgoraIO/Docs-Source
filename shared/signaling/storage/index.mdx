<Vpd k="NAME" /> storage is a powerful feature that enables you to store and manage channel and user attributes in a serverless storage system. It acts as an extension of your database, offering synchronization across all participants. By using signaling storage, you can develop innovative, reliable, and scalable applications without the hassle of setting up your own database. This seamless integration ensures that data is readily available and up-to-date for all users, making it easier to build real-time and collaborative applications. 

Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> receives metadata modification events in real-time enabling you to update the front-end accordingly. You can leverage user and channel metadata in <Vpd k="NAME" /> apps to:

* **Maintain search history**: Enable users to quickly search for specific messages, users, or topics within the app.

* **Customize notifications**: Enable users to customize their notification settings, such as choosing notifications to receive and setting custom alert tones. 

* **Enhance security**: Enforce security measures, such as verifying user identity and encrypting messages. 

## Understand the tech

Using <Vpd k="NAME" /> storage you associate metadata with a particular channel or a specific user:

* **Channel metadata**: store and distribute contextual channel data in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as props, announcements, member lists, and relationship chains.
When channel properties are set, updated, or deleted by a user, an event notification is triggered, and other users in the channel receive this information within 100ms.

* **User metadata**: store and distribute contextual data about users in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.  A user has one
set of metadata with one or more attributes. When an attribute is set, updated or deleted, an event notification is
triggered, and users who subscribe to this users metadata will receive this information within 100ms.

This section presents an overview of the steps required to integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> storage into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the basic workflow you implement to read and write channel and user metadata:
