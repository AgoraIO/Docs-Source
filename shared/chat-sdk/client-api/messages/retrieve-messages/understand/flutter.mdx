The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. The following are the core methods:

- `fetchConversationListFromServer`: Retrieves a list of conversations stored on the server.
- `fetchHistoryMessages`: Retrieves the historical messages in the specified conversation from the server.
- `deleteRemoteMessagesBefore`/`deleteRemoteMessagesWithIds`: Deletes historical messages from the server unidirectionally.
- `deleteRemoteConversation`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.
