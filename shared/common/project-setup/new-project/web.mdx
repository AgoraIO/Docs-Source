1.  Create a new project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

    1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.

    2.  Execute the following command in the terminal:

        ``` bash
        npm create vite@latest agora_project --template vanilla
        ```

        When prompted to select a framework, choose `Vanilla` and when prompted to select a variant, choose `JavaScript`.
        A directory named *agora\_project* is created which contains the project files. We will update the following files in the directory:

        -   *index.html*: The visual interface with the user.

        -   *main.js*: The programmable interface used to implement the  <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> logic.

2.  Install the dependencies:

    In the terminal, navigate to the *agora\_project* directory, and execute the following command.

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Install the <Vpd k="SDK" />:

    Execute the following command in the terminal to download and install the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

    ``` bash
    npm i agora-rtc-sdk-ng
    ```

    These steps are for package install, if you prefer to manually install, follow the [installation instructions](../reference/downloads#manual-installation).
