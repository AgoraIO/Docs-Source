### Remove plugins when Maven Central is integrated

When integrating the Android SDK through Maven Central, you can modify the `dependencies` in the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file to specify the dynamic library you need to integrate and exclude the plug-ins you don't need to use. For the correspondence between each file in the Android SDK and the field `dependencies` in see the implementation field for details `.implementation`

#### Sample code

Example 1: When integrating Android Video SDK version `4.x` and using all plug-ins, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

```
dependencies {
 implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:4.0.1'
 implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-screen-sharing:4.0.1'
 ...
}
```

Example 2: When integrating Android Video SDK version `4.x` and not using all plug-ins, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

```
dependencies {
 implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:4.0.1'
 ...
}
```

Example 3: When integrating the Android Video SDK version `4.x`, if you only need to use the AI ​​noise reduction plug-in and Bel Canto plug-in from the plug-in list, specify the `dependencies` as follows:

```
dependencies {
 def agora_sdk_version = "4.0.1"
 // The following code contains $, so you must use "", not ''
 implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:${agora_sdk_version}"
 implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-ains:${agora_sdk_version}"
 implementation "io.agora.rtc:audio-beauty:${agora_sdk_version}"
 ...
}
```

### Dynamically Load `.so` Files

This method is only suitable for manually integrating the Android SDK, not for integrating the SDK through Maven Central.

In general, you package the required `.so` files, and the SDK loads the `.so` files from the app's `nativeLibraryPath` directory.

The SDK provides the `mNativeLibPath` attribute in the `RtcEngineConfig` class to support dynamic loading of the required `.so` files, thereby reducing the size of the app's installation package. Refer to the following steps to realize this function:

1. Download the latest version of the SDK from the SDK download page and decompress it.
2. Integrate `agora-rtc-sdk.jar` into your project.
3. Upload the `.so` files for all architectures to your server and make sure that the app can download the `.so` files for the target architecture over the network.
4. When the app runs, it checks for the existence of an `.so` file. If not found, it downloads the `.so` file and saves it to the private directory of the app.
5. When calling `create` to create and initialize an `RtcEngine` instance, set the `mNativeLibPath` config parameter to the app private directory where the `.so` file is located.
6. After calling `create` successfully, the SDK will automatically load the `.so` file according to the specified path.
