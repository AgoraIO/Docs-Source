This page shows you how to create your first <Vg k="SIG" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

#### Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />

The login process includes:

1.  The app client requests a token from your app server.

2.  The app server returns the token to the app client.

3.  The app client logs in to <Vg k="SIG" /> with the token.

#### Peer-to-peer messaging

The peer messaging process includes:

1.  Client A sends a peer message to <Vg k="SIG" />.

2.  <Vg k="SIG" /> sends the message to client B. Client B receives the peer message.

#### Channel messaging

The channel messaging process includes:

1.  Client A creates a channel and join the channel.

2.  Client B and client C joins the channel created by client A.

3.  Client A sends a channel message to <Vg k="SIG" />.

4.  <Vg k="SIG" /> sends the channel message to client B and C. Client B and client C receives the message.

For an app client to join a channel, you need the following information:

-   The App ID: A randomly generated string provided by Agora for identifying your app. You can get the App ID from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

-   The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. You need to specify the user ID yourself, and ensure that it is unique in the channel.

-   A token: In a test or production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your server.

-   The channel name: A string that identifies the channel for the channel messaging.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

<GetStartedSDK  product="Signaling" company="Agora" sdk="Signaling SDK" client="app" />
