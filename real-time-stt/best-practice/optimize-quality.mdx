  Optimize Realtime STT transcription quality and cost

To optimize transcription quality and reduce costs, specify only one source language per STT agent or task. This approach avoids additional language identification fees and provides the most accurate results.

* **Single-language channel**

  If all users in a channel speak the same language, start one STT agent or task that subscribes to all relevant UIDs.

* **Multi-language channel** 

  If users in a channel speak different languages, start a separate STT agent or task for each source language.

* **Multilingual speaker**

  If a user speaks multiple languages, creating one STT agent or task per language will not capture their speech effectively. Instead, start a dedicated STT agent or task for that UID to handle language-specific transcription and translation.
