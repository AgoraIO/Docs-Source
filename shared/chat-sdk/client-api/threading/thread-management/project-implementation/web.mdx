### Create a thread

All chat group members can call `createChatThread` to create a thread from a specific message in a chat group.

Once a thread is created in a chat group, all chat group members receive the `onChatThreadChange` callback triggered by the `create` event. In a multi-device use-case, all the other devices receive the `onMultiDeviceEvent` callback triggered by the `chatThreadCreate` event.

The following sample code shows how to create a thread in a chat group:

```javascript
// parentId: The ID of a chat group where a thread resides.
// threadName: The name of a thread. The maximum length of a thread name is 64 characters.
// messageId: The ID of a message, from which a thread is created.
chatClient.createChatThread({
  parentId: "parentId",
  name: "threadName",
  messageId: "messageId",
});
// Listen for the creating thread callback.
chatClient.addEventHandler("handlerId", {
  onChatThreadChange: (threadMsg) => {
    console.log(threadMsg);
  },
});
```

### Destroy a thread

Only the chat group owner and admins can call `destroyChatThread` to disband a thread in a chat group.

Once a thread is disbanded, all chat group members receive the `onChatThreadChange` callback triggered by the `destroy` event. In a multi-device use-case, all the other devices receive the `onMultiDeviceEvent` callback triggered by the `chatThreadDestroy` event.

<Admonition type="info">
  Once a thread is destroyed or the chat group where a thread resides is
  destroyed, all data of the thread is deleted from the local database and
  memory.
</Admonition>

The following sample code shows how to destroy a thread:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The ID of a thread that you want to destroy.
chatClient.destroyChatThread({ chatThreadId: "chatThreadId" });
// Listen for the destroying thread callback.
chatClient.addEventHandler("handlerId", {
  onChatThreadChange: (threadMsg) => {
    console.log(threadMsg);
  },
});
```

### Join a thread

All chat group members can refer to the following steps to join a thread:

1. Use either of the following two approaches to retrieve the thread ID:

- Retrieve the thread list in a chat group by calling [`getChatThreads`](#fetch), and locate the ID of the thread that you want to join.
- Retrieve the thread ID within the `onChatThreadChange` callback that you receive.

2. Call `joinChatThread` to pass in the thread ID and join the specified thread.

In a multi-device use-case, all the other devices receive the `onMultiDeviceEvent` callback triggered by the `chatThreadJoin` event.

The following sample code shows how to join a thread:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The ID of a thread that you want to join.
chatClient.joinChatThread({ chatThreadId: "chatThreadId" });
```

### Leave a thread

All thread members can call `leaveChatThread` to leave a thread. Once a member leaves a thread, they can no longer receive the thread messages.

In a multi-device use-case, all the other devices receive the `onMultiDeviceEvent` callback triggered by the `chatThreadLeave` event.

The following sample code shows how to leave a thread:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The ID of a thread that you want to leave.
chatClient.leaveChatThread({ chatThreadId: "chatThreadId" });
```

### Remove a member from a thread

Only the chat group owner and admins can call `removeChatThreadMember` to remove the specified member from a thread.

Once a member is removed from a thread, they receive the `onChatThreadChange` callback triggered by the `userRemove` event and can no longer receive the thread messages.

The following sample code shows how to remove a member from a thread:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The ID of a thread.
// username: The ID of the user to be removed from a thread.
chatClient.removeChatThreadMember({
  chatThreadId: "chatThreadId",
  username: "username",
});
```

### Update the name of a thread

Only the chat group owner, chat group admins, and thread creator can call `changeChatThreadName` to update a thread name.

Once a thread name is updated, all chat group members receive the `onChatThreadChange` callback triggered by the `update` event. In a multi-device use-case, all the other devices receive the `onMultiDeviceEvent` callback triggered by the `chatThreadNameUpdate` event.

The following sample code shows how to update a thread name:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The ID of a thread.
// name: The updated thread name. The maximum length of a thread name is 64 characters.
chatClient.changeChatThreadName({ chatThreadId: "chatThreadId", name: "name" });
// Listen for the updating thread name callback.
chatClient.addEventHandler("handlerId", {
  onChatThreadChange: (threadMsg) => {
    console.log(threadMsg);
  },
});
```

### Retrieve the attributes of a thread

All chat group members can call `getChatThreadDetail` to retrieve the thread attributes from the server.

The following sample code shows how to retrieve the thread attributes:

```javascript
// chatThreadID: The thread ID.
chatClient.getChatThreadDetail({ chatThreadId: "chatThreadId" }).then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});
```

### Retrieve the member list of a thread

All chat group members can call `getChatThreadMembers` to retrieve a paginated member list of a thread from the server, as shown in the following sample code:

```javascript
// chatThreadId: The thread ID.
// pageSize: The maximum number of members to retrieve per page. The range is [1, 50].
// cursor: The position from which to start getting data. Pass in `null` or an empty string at the first call.
chatClient
  .getChatThreadMembers({
    chatThreadId: "chatThreadId ",
    pageSize: 20,
    cursor: null,
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

### Retrieve a thread list

Users can call `getJoinedChatThreads` to retrieve a paginated list from the server of all the threads they have joined, as shown in the following sample code:

```javascript
// pageSize: The maximum number of threads to retrieve per page. The range is [1, 50].
// cursor: The position from which to start getting data. Pass in `null` or an empty string at the first call.
chatClient
  .getJoinedChatThreads({ cursor: "cursor", pageSize: 20 })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

Users can call `getJoinedChatThreads` to retrieve a paginated list from the server of all the threads they have joined in a specified chat group, as shown in the following sample code:

```javascript
// parentId: The chat group ID.
// pageSize: The maximum number of threads to retrieve per page. The range is [1, 50].
// cursor: The position from which to start getting data. Pass in `null` or an empty string at the first call.
chatClient
  .getJoinedChatThreads({
    parentId: "parentId",
    pageSize: 20,
    cursor: null,
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

Users can also call `getChatThreads` to retrieve a paginated list from the server of all the threads in a specified chat group, as shown in the following sample code:<a name="fetch"></a>

```javascript
// parentId: The chat group ID.
// pageSize: The maximum number of threads to retrieve per page. The range is [1, 50].
// cursor: The position from which to start getting data. Pass in `null` or an empty string at the first call.
chatClient
  .getChatThreads({ parentId: "parentId", pageSize: 20, cursor: null })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```

### Retrieve the latest message from multiple threads

Users can call `getChatThreadLastMessage` to retrieve the latest message from multiple threads.

The following sample code shows how to retrieve the latest message from multiple threads:

```javascript
// chatThreadIds: The thread IDs. You can pass in a maximum of 20 thread IDs.
chatClient
  .getChatThreadLastMessage({
    chatThreadIds: ["chatThreadId1", "chatThreadId2"],
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  });
```
