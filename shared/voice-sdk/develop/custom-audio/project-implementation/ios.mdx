To push audio from a custom source to a channel, do the following:

1.  **Define variables to manage and push the audio stream**

    In `ViewController.swift`, add the following declarations to the `ViewController` class:

    ```swift
    // Audio file parameters
    var SAMPLE_RATE: Int = 44100
    var NUM_OF_CHANNELS: Int = 1
    ```

1.  **Add a raw audio file to the project**

    In this example, you use an audio file as the source of your custom audio data. Download a sample a sample audio file in `*.wav` format, open it in Finder, and drag it to your Xcode project.

1.  **Enable publishing the custom audio track**

    When a user presses **Join**, you set the `ChannelMediaOptions` to disable the microphone audio track and enable the custom audio track. You also enable custom audio local playback and set the external audio source. To do this, add the following lines to the `joinChannel()` method in the `ViewController` class after the `if self.userRole == .broadcaster` block:

    ```swift
    option.channelProfile = .of((Int32)(AgoraChannelProfile.communication.rawValue))
    option.publishCameraTrack = .of(false)
    option.publishAudioTrack = .of(false)
    option.publishCustomAudioTrack = .of(true)
    agoraEngine.setExternalAudioSource(true, sampleRate: SAMPLE_RATE, channels: NUM_OF_CHANNELS, sourceNumber: 1, localPlayback: true, publish: true)
    ```

1.  **Open the audio file and push data**

    To play the audio file when a user joins the channel, you open the audio file and start pushing the data. To do this, add the following lines after `joined = true` in the `joinChannel()` method:

    ```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "<audio-filename-without-extension>", withExtension: "<extension>")
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf:url!) else { return }
    agoraEngine.pushExternalAudioFrameNSData(data, sourceId: 0, timestamp: 0)
    ```

    Replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` and `<extension>` with appropriate values. For example, for a file named `audio.wav` replace `<audio-filename-without-extension>` with `audio` and `<extension>` with `wav`.
