After completing the above configuration, click **Apply**.

### Create a user interface

Create a user interface for your project based on your application scenario. If you have already created a user interface, skip to the next step.

To create a basic UI, add the following controls:
<ProductWrapper notAllowed="voice-calling">
* A Picture Control for displaying local video
* A Picture Control for displaying remote video
* An Edit Control for entering a channel name
* Buttons to join and leave a channel 
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="voice-calling">
* Join channel button
* Leave channel button
* An input field for the channel name
</ProductWrapper>

Refer to the following steps, to create a user interface:
