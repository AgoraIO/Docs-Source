The Agora <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> supports the call invitation function, including the following behaviors in common call scenarios:

-   Caller: Sends or cancels a call invitation.

-   Callee: Accepts or refuses a call invitation.

The call invitation function provided by the Agora <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> only implements the basic control logic of the call invitation: sending, canceling, accepting, and refusing the call invitation. The Agora <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> does not handle operations after a callee accepts the invitation, nor does it manage the entire lifecycle. You must implement that yourself according to your requirements.

The call invitation can be applied to the following scenarios:

-   A call invitation requiring notification of an incoming call.

-   A screen-sharing scenario requiring call invitations.

-   A whiteboard-sharing scenario requiring a video call between two parties.

-   A call invitation requiring synchronizing the states of both parties.
