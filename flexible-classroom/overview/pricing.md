## Cost calculation

Billing occurs monthly. At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates the total duration of the audio and video usage in minutes for that month in all projects under your developer account. After deducting the monthly [10,000 free-of-charge minutes](#free-minutes) that <Vg k="COMPANY" /> grants to every account, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> multiplies any remaining usage by its corresponding unit price and adds up the costs to get the total cost for that month.

The basic formula is shown here:

**Monthly cost** = **<Vg k="FC" /> services** + **recording services** + **each service exceeding the free quota**

### Service usage

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates the usage based on the number of users in the room. This means that usage for each room is the sum of the usages generated by all users in that room.

For each user, Agora starts timing when they join the room and ends when they leave the room, down to a minute. 

Depending on whether the user subscribes to the video stream in the room, the usage is divided into the following categories:

- Audio usage: If the user does not subscribe to the video stream, audio usage is generated regardless of whether the user subscribes to the audio stream.
- Video usage: If the user successfully subscribes to the video stream, video usage is generated. 

If a user subscribes to both audio and video streams, only the video usage is generated. Video usage is divided into four different types based on aggregate resolution and priced individually. 

### Free minutes

The number of free minutes for each service and the billing strategy for the portion exceeding the free quota are detailed in the table below:

| Service item       | Usage measurement | Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Free monthly quota                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Overage fee                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Usage-based volume discounts

Agora automatically offers the following tiered discounts for total monthly usage that exceeds 100,000 minutes:

| Minutes used        | Discount level |
|---------------------|----------------|
| 100,000 to 499,999  | 5%             |
| 500,000 to 999,999  | 7%             |
| 1,000,000 and above | 10%            |

Note that the discounts for each tier are only applicable to the usage within the corresponding tier. For example, if the usage is 600,000 minutes, there will be no discount for 1 to 99,999 minutes, but there will be a 5% discount for 100,000 to 499,999 minutes and a 7% discount for 500,000 to 999,999 minutes.

## Examples

This section illustrates how Agora calculates aggregate video resolution, total usage per service type, and the associated costs.

Suppose that 1 teacher, 5 students, and 3 parents join a room at the same time and conduct a 60-minute interactive live video course. In this course:

- The teacher and 5 students interact via video. The resolution is 360 × 240.
- 3 parents subscribe to the video streams of the teacher and all students. 
- The teacher shares their screen with all students and parents in the room. The resolution of both sent and received screen sharing streams is 1280 × 720.

### Calculate aggregate video resolution

The following table shows the calculations for the aggregate resolution for each user’s video stream subscriptions. These determine the unit prices for their video usage:

| User     | Subscribed video streams                              | Aggregate video resolution               | Total                               | Video type                                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Teacher  | 5 students                                            | 360 × 240 × 5                            | 432,000                             | High-definition video (HD)                            |
| Student  | Teacher + shared screen by teacher + 4 other students | 360 × 240 + 1280 x 720 + 360 × 240 × 4   | 1,353,600                           | Full HD video                                         |
| Parent   | Teacher + shared screen by teacher + 5 students       | 360 × 240 + 1280 x 720 + 360 × 240 × 5   | 1,440,000                           | Full HD video                                         |

### Cost calculation

The following table shows the calculation of the total cost of the live video course:

| Billed service (video type) | Total usage (minutes) = Sum of all individual usage | Unit price (US$/1,000 minutes) | Cost of each service (US$) | Total cost (US$) (rounded to two decimal places) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| HD                          | 60                                                  | 5.99                           | (60/1000) × 5.99 = 0.36    | The total cost is 6.12                           |
| Full HD                     | 60 × 8 = 480                                        | 11.99                          | (480/1000) × 11.99 = 5.76  |                                                  |
