3.  Enter your project name, and select **APP ID** for the authentication mechanism in the pop-up window.
    Agora recommends using an App ID for authentication only in a test environment, or if your project has low security requirements.

4.  Click **Submit**. You can see the created project on the **Project Management** page.

### 2. Get an App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the [Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects) page in Agora Console, and click the eye icon to the right of the App ID.
