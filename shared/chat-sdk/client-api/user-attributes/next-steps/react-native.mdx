### Manage user avatar

The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> only supports storing the URL address of the avatar file rather than the file itself. To manage user avatars, you need to use a third-party file storage service.

To implement user avatar management in your app, take the following steps:

1. Upload the avatar file to the third-party file storage service. Once the file is successfully uploaded, you get a URL address of the avatar file.
2. Set the `avatarUrl` parameter in user attributes as the URL address of the avatar file.
3. To display the avatar, call `fetchUserInfoById` to retrieve the URL of the avatar file, and then render the image on the local UI.

### Create and send a namecard using user attributes

Namecard messages are custom messages that include the user ID, nickname, avatar, email address, and phone number of the specified user. To create and send a namecard, take the following steps:

1. Create a custom message and set the `event` of the custom message as `userCard`.
2. Add `userId`, `nickname`, and `avatarUrl` as fileds in `ext`. Send the custom message.

Followings are the sample code for creating and sending a namecard message:

```typescript
// Customize the message.
const event = "userCard";
// You can also add more fields in ext
const ext = { userId: "userId", nickname: "nickname", avatarUrl: "avatarUrl" };
const msg = ChatMessage.createCustomMessage(targetId, event, chatType, {
  params: JSON.parse(ext),
});
// Call sendMessage to send the customized message.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.sendMessage(msg!, new ChatMessageCallback())
  .then(() => {
    console.log("send message success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("send message fail.", reason);
  });
```
