The default audio module of <Vpd k="SDK" /> meets the need of using basic audio functions in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. For adding advanced audio functions, <Vpd k="SDK" /> supports using custom audio sources and custom audio rendering modules.

<Vg k="VSDK" /> uses the basic audio module on the device your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> runs on by default. However, there are certain use-cases where you want to integrate a custom audio source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as:

* Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has its own audio module.
* You need to process the captured audio with a pre-processing library for audio enhancement.
* You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

This page shows you how to capture and render audio from custom sources.

## Understand the tech

To set an external audio source, you configure the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> before joining a channel. To manage the capture and processing of audio frames, you use methods from outside the <Vg k="VSDK" /> that are specific to your custom source. <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to push processed audio data to the subscribers in a channel.

#### Capture custom audio
The following figure illustrates the process of custom audio capture.

- You implement the capture module using external methods provided by the SDK.
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unreal">
- You call `pushExternalAudioFrame` to send the captured audio frames to the SDK.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="unreal">
- You call `pushAudioFrame` to send the captured audio frames to the SDK.
</PlatformWrapper>


#### Render custom audio

The following figure illustrates the process of custom audio rendering.

![Audio Data Transmission](/images/rtc-sdk/custom-audio-rendering-sdk.svg)

- You implement the rendering module using external methods provided by the SDK.
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unreal">
- You call `pullPlaybackAudioFrame` to retrieve the audio data sent by remote users.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="unreal">
- You call `pullAudioFrame` to retrieve the audio data sent by remote users.
</PlatformWrapper>
