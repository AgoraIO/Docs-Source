SQLCipher is used to encrypt the database that stores local messages. The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> uses `ChatManager` to manage local messages. Followings are the core methods:

- `getAllConversations`: Loads the conversation list on the local device.
- `loadMessagesStartFromId`: Loads messages of a conversation.
- `deleteMessage`: Deletes a message sent or received in a local conversation.
- `deleteAllMessages`: Deletes all messages in a local conversation.
- `removeMessagesStart`: Deletes messages sent and received in a certain period in a local conversation.
- `AgoraChatConversation.unreadMessagesCount`: Retrieves the count of unread messages in the specified conversation.
- `pinConversation`: Pins a conversation.
- `getPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor`: Retrieves the pinned conversations from the server with pagination.
- `deleteServerConversation`: Deletes a conversation from the server.
- `AgoraChatConversation.loadMessagesStartFromId`: Searches for messages from the local database.
- `AgoraChatConversation.insertMessage`: Inserts messages in the specified conversation.
- `deleteAllMessagesAndConversations`: Clears the current user's chat history, including messages and conversations in individual chats, group chats, and chat rooms. You can also choose whether to clear the chat history on the server in one direction.
