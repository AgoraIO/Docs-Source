To use an extension in your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project:

-   The implementation procedure varies according to extensions. Each extension vendor provides their own implementation guides, which is validated by Agora before the official release of the extension.

-   To implement the extension in your project, go to the detail page of the extension on [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/marketplace/extension), click **Implementation guides**, and follow the steps on the page.

Currently, Web extension is in Beta. To learn how to use a Web extension, see [<Vg k="RTEE_NS" />](/video-calling/develop/ai-denoiser).
