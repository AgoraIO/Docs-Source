To test the cloud proxy functionality:

1. **Configure the project**

    1. <OpenConfig/>

    1. <SetAppId/>

    1. <SetAuthenticationMethod/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test cloud proxy**:

    Click Join to start a call.
    
    You see your app starts the proxy service and magically connects to the Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ which was not possible in a restricted network environment.
