<PlatformWrapper platform="android">

The component corresponding to the Whiteboard widget is named `AgoraEduWhiteBoardComponent`, and the widget ID can be obtained using `AgoraWidgetDefaultId.WhiteBoard.id`. Use this component to turn the Whiteboard on or off.

To enable or disable the Whiteboard, you monitor the status changes of the Whiteboard caused by the teacher client and adjust the UI accordingly. See `initView()` in the file `AgoraEduUIKit/src/main/java/com/agora/edu/component/whiteboard/AgoraEduWhiteBoardComponent.kt` for the logic of registering observers, listening for active states, and creating or destroying Whiteboard components in the methods.

If you want to open and close the Whiteboard by yourself, you can refer to the following code examples:

* To turn on the Whiteboard, add the following code to the file where the button to open the Whiteboard is located:

    ```java
    val info = AgoraWidgetRoomPropsUpdateReq(state = 1)
    eduContext?.widgetContext()?.setWidgetActive(AgoraWidgetDefaultId.WhiteBoard.id, info)
    ```

* To close the Whiteboard, add the following code to the file where the button to close the Whiteboard is located:

    ```java
    eduContext?.widgetContext()?.setWidgetInActive(AgoraWidgetDefaultId.WhiteBoard.id)
    ```

* To register an observer, use the following code:

    ```java
    eduContext?.widgetContext()?.addWidgetActiveObserver(widgetActiveObserver, AgoraWidgetDefaultId.LargeWindow.id)
    ```

* To monitor the status of the widget, use the following code:

    ```java
    private val widgetActiveObserver = object : AgoraWidgetActiveObserver {
        override fun onWidgetActive(widgetId: String) {
            // The Whiteboard has been created, here is the child thread
            if (widgetId == AgoraWidgetDefaultId.WhiteBoard.id) {

            }
        }

        override fun onWidgetInActive(widgetId: String) {
            // The Whiteboard has been removed, here is the child thread
            if (widgetId == AgoraWidgetDefaultId.WhiteBoard.id) {

            }
        }
    }
    ```
