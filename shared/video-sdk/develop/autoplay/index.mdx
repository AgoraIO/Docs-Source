To give users more control over media playback, browsers limit autoplay. They often require user interaction, like clicking or tapping, before audio can play. This prevents disruptive or unexpected audio from automatically starting when users visit a webpage, leading to a smoother and less intrusive experience.

In most browsers, video without sound can autoplay without restriction. However, on iOS devices, video autoplay may be restricted in specific cases:

- iOS Safari when in low-power mode.
- iOS WKWebView, such as in the WeChat browser, if custom autoplay restrictions are enabled.

## Understand the tech

When using the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Web SDK, calling `play()` on audio or video tracks before any user interaction may cause the media to fail due to autoplay restrictions. As a result, users may neither hear the audio nor see the video.

To handle autoplay restrictions when using the Web SDK, consider one of the following approaches:

**Remove autoplay restriction via callback**: If autoplay fails, use the `onAutoplayFailed` callback to display a button, prompting users to interact with the page and remove the autoplay restriction.

**Ensure interaction before playback**: Ensure that the user interacts with the page before calling `play()`. This guarantees that media plays as intended.

Even with these solutions, autoplay restrictions require users to interact with the page before media can play. Over time, if users frequently visit the page, browsers may relax the autoplay policy for that specific page. However, this behavior cannot be detected or controlled through JavaScript.
