 Integrate 3rd party AI avatars into Agora's Conversational AI Engine.
---

AI avatars provide visual representations for your conversational agents, creating more engaging and natural interactions through lifelike digital characters. They combine real-time speech synthesis with synchronized facial animations and gestures, enabling face-to-face conversations with AI agents. Agora supports multiple avatar providers, allowing you to choose the best visual quality, animation style, and performance characteristics for your application.

## Integration steps

To integrate the AI avatar provider of your choice, follow these steps:

1. Choose your avatar provider from the [Supported avatar providers](#supported-avatar-providers) list
1. Obtain an API key and credentials from the provider's console
1. Copy the sample configuration for your chosen provider
1. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
1. Configure avatar appearance and behavior settings for your use case
1. Specify the configuration in the request body as `properties` > `avatar` when [Starting a conversational AI agent](../../rest-api/join)

## Supported avatar providers

<Vpd k="NAME" /> currently supports the following AI avatar providers:

- [Akool (Beta)](akool)
- [HeyGen (Alpha)](heygen)

Choose a provider based on your avatar style preferences, language support, video quality requirements, and budget considerations. Refer to each provider's documentation for complete feature sets, customization options, and pricing details.

## Key considerations

When selecting an AI avatar provider, consider the following factors:

* **Video quality and performance**: Different providers offer varying resolutions, frame rates, and rendering quality. Higher quality avatars provide more realistic interactions but may require more bandwidth and processing power.

    The maximum concurrency for avatars is determined by the lesser of two values: the Conversational AI service concurrency and the specific avatar vendor's concurrency limit.

* **Billing and usage**: AI avatars incur video streaming costs in addition to provider fees. Review the pricing models of both [Agora's video services](/video-calling/overview/pricing) and your chosen avatar provider to understand total costs.
