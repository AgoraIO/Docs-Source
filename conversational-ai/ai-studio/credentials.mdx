<Vpd k="STUDIO" /> provides centralized credential management through **My Resources**. You can securely store and reuse API keys and configuration settings for your LLM, ASR, and TTS providers across all pipelines.

## Add credentials

To save your credentials for a vendor:

1. Log in to <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.
1. From the left sidebar, select **<Vpd k="STUDIO" />**.
1. Click **My Resources** in the sidebar menu.
1. Click **Add Credential**.

1. From the **Type** dropdown, select ASR, LLM, or TTS.
1. Select the vendor from the dropdown for which you want to add the credential.
1. Enter a descriptive name for your credential.
1. Paste your provider API key and fill in other related parameters, if any.
1. Click **Save**.

## Use credentials in pipelines

Once you add a credential to **My Resources**, you can use it in any pipeline:

1. Open a pipeline in the pipeline editor.
2. Click the ASR, LLM, or TTS component you want to configure.
3. In the configuration panel, click the **Credential** dropdown.
4. Select the credential you created in **My Resources**.

You can use the same credential across multiple pipelines, making it easy to maintain consistent provider settings and update API keys in one location.

## Update credentials

To update an existing credential:

1. Navigate to **My Resources** in <Vpd k="STUDIO" />.
1. Find the credential you want to update and click the **Edit** icon.
1. Update the API key or configuration settings as needed.
1. Click **Save**.

Changes to credentials in **My Resources** automatically apply to all pipelines using that credential.

## Delete credentials

To delete a credential:

1. Navigate to **My Resources** in <Vpd k="STUDIO" />.
1. Find the credential you want to delete and click the **Delete** icon.
1. Confirm the deletion.

<Admonition type="caution"> 
Deleting a credential affects all pipelines that use it. Verify that no active pipelines depend on the credential before deleting, or update those pipelines to use a different credential first.
</Admonition>

## Credential security

Credentials stored in **My Resources** are:

- Encrypted and securely stored in your Agora account
- Only accessible to users with access to your Agora project
- Never exposed in pipeline configurations or logs

Best practices for credential management:

- Use descriptive names to distinguish between development, staging, and production credentials
- Rotate API keys regularly according to your security policies
- Delete unused credentials to minimize security exposure
- Avoid sharing API keys outside of **My Resources**
