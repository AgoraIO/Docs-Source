This guide explains how to configure and apply watermarks when recording video with the <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

Use watermarks to display logos, timestamps, or custom text for branding, copyright, or verification. The <Vpd k="SDK" /> supports three types of watermarks in both individual and composite recording modes:

- **Text watermark**: Shows user-defined text with customizable font and size.
- **Timestamp watermark**: Displays the current time from the recording server.
- **Image watermark**: Renders a static image in PNG or JPG format.

## Prerequisites

Before adding watermarks, integrate the <Vpd k="SDK" /> and complete the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/quickstart) guide to ensure basic recording works as expected.

## Implementation

To add watermarks to your recordings, follow the platform-specific implementation instructions:
