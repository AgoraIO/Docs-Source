---

In this tutorial, we will show you how to make Dify Bot speak in TEN-Agent playground.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have: 

-  The TEN-Agent playground running. Follow the [Run Playground](../get-started/playground-quickstart) to start the playground.
- The following information:
  - Dify API Key
  - STT info: Any supported STT can be used. [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) is relatively easy to register and get started with.
  - TTS info: Any supported TTS can be used. [Fish.Audio](https://fish.audio/) is relatively easy to register and get started with.
  - RTC info. Currently only [Agora](https://www.agora.io/) RTC is supported. Have your App ID and App Certificate ready when you configure your `.env` file.

You can use any agent or chat assistant defined on the Dify platform. Each agent or chat assistant has its own API key.

## Steps

1. Open the playground at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to configure your agent.
1. Select the graph type `voice_assistant`.
1. Click on `Module Picker` to open the module selection.
1. If you preferred STT/TTS module is not by default selected, you can select the module from the dropdown list. Note you will need to configure the module with the correct information like API key, etc.
1. From `LLM` module, click on the dropdown and select `Dify Chat Bot`.
1. Click on `Save Change` to apply the module to the graph.
1. Click on the Button to the right of the graph selection to open the property configuration. You will see a list of properties that can be configured for the `Dify Chat Bot` module.
1. Configure the `Dify API Key` property with the information you prepared.
1. Click on `Save Change` to apply the property to the `Dify Chat Bot` module.
1. If you see the success toast, the property is successfully applied to the `Dify Chat Bot` module.
1. You are all set! Now you can start speaking to Dify Bot by clicking on the `Connect` button. Note you will need to wait a few seconds for agent to initialize itself.

## Using Azure STT

Azure STT is integrated within RTC extension module. That's why if you want to use Azure STT, you will need to select `voice_assistant_integrated_stt` graph type.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:

- You have the correct API key for Dify chatbot.
- In Dify, your chat assistant has a valid model key configured.
- You have the correct STT and TTS modules selected and configured.
- You have the correct graph type selected.
