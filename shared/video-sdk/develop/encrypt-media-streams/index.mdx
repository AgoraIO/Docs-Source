Media stream encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel can see and hear each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires media stream encryption, <Vpd k="NAME"/> provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.

This page shows you how to integrate built-in media stream encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Understand the tech

To ensure secure communication, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses the same SSL [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to encrypt and decrypt data in the channel. You use the key and salt to create an encryption configuration. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses the encryption configuration to encrypt a stream and sends it to remote users. When the remote user receives the encrypted media stream, the remote <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> decrypts the media stream using the same salt and key.

The following figure shows the call flow for the media stream encryption:

All users in a channel must use the same encryption configuration to initiate `agoraEngine` and enable encryption before joining a channel. If you donâ€™t have the correct configuration, you cannot decrypt channel content. Best practice is that your authentication system generates a new key and salt regularly.
