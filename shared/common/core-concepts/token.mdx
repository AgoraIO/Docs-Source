#### Token

A token is a dynamic key that is used by the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> authentication server to check user permissions. You use <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to generate a temporary token for testing purposes during the development process. In a production environment, you implement a token server in your security infrastructure to control access to your channels.
