After logging in to Chat, users can send the following types of messages to a peer user, a chat group, or a chat room:
- Text messages, including hyperlinks and emojis.

- Attachment messages, including image, voice, video, and file messages.

- Location messages.

- CMD messages.

- Extended messages.

- Custom messages.

In high-concurrency scenarios, you can set a certain message type or messages from a chat room member as high, normal, or low.
In this case, low-priority messages are dropped first to reserve resources for the high-priority ones, for example, gifts and announcements, when the server is overloaded.
This ensures that the high-priority messages can be dealt with first when loads of messages are being sent in high concurrency or high frequency.
Note that this feature can increase the delivery reliability of high-priority messages, but cannot guarantee the deliveries.
Even high-priorities messages can be dropped when the server load goes too high.

The Chat message feature is language agnostic. End users can send messages in any language, as long as their devices support input in that language. 

This page shows how to implement sending and receiving these messages using the Chat SDK.

## Understand the tech

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- You have integrated the Chat SDK, initialized the SDK and implemented the functionality of registering accounts and login. For details, see <Link to="/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-sdk">Chat <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>.
- You understand the API call frequency limits as described in [Limitations](/agora-chat/reference/limitations).

## Implementation

This section shows how to implement sending and receiving the various types of messages.
