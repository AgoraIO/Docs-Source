### Install required library through `vcpkg`

You can also install required library & Packages using vcpkg package manager by following these steps:

**Install vcpkg** by following the instructions on the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg  
```
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where vcpkg was installed.

Run the following commands: 


1. To install **OpenSSL** libraries (**libssl.lib** and **libcrypto.lib**)
```sh
vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
```
2. To install **zlib** library (**zlib.lib**)
```sh
vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows
```
Note: x64-windows is for 64-bit version of Windows. For 32-bit version, use x86-windows instead.

3. Once the installation is complete, open your Visual Studio project.
Right-click on the project name in the Solution Explorer and select **Properties** from the context menu.
In the Property Pages, select **VC++ Directories** from the left-hand side menu.
Add the  `vcpkg installed directory include` path to the **Include Directories** field.
For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the include directory would be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include\`

4. In the same Property Pages, select **Linker** from the left-hand side menu.
Add the  `vcpkg installed directory lib` path to the **Library Directories** field.
For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the library directory would be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib`.

5. In the same Property Pages, select **Linker > Input** from the left-hand side menu.
Add **zlib.lib,libssl.lib** and **libcrypto.lib** to the **Additional Dependencies** field.


6. In the same Property Pages, select **Debugging** from the left-hand side menu.
Add the vcpkg directory containing the Dll files `vcpkg installed directory bin` path to the **Environment** field.
For example, if vcpkg is installed in `C:\vcpkg`, and you installed openssl & zlib using the above command, then the path to the library directory would be `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib`.
    
    **Note** : If the above path adding for Dlls doesn't work for you then you can copy the require DLLs (**libssl-3-x64.dll,libcrypto-3-x64.dll** and **zlib1.dll**) from  vcpkg installed path  bin directory (like `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin`)  to your project debug folder (like `<project name>\x64\Debug`)

Save your changes and rebuild your project.
