Stream transfer allows Agora to forward a live stream to third-party platforms. With this feature, your app users can publish their live streams on a number of social platforms.

## Transfer callback requirements

If you specify `callbackUrl` when calling the [Set transfer configuration](#patch) API, Agora sends requests to this URL to get the platform addresses where the live stream are published. The request sent by Agora has the following format:

```shellscript
POST https://example.transfer.com/callback?entry_point={entry_point}&stream_name={stream_name} HTTP/1.1
```

Where `entry_point` is the name of the entry point, and `stream_name` is the name of the live `stream`.

For such a request, the HTTP response you return must meet the following requirements:

- The response is in JSON format.
- If the request succeeds, the HTTP status code is 200.
- The target addresses are included in the `transferUrls` field in the response body:
   ```json
   {
       "transferUrls": [
           "rtmp://cdna.example.com/live/testedge",
           "rtmp://cdnb.example.com/live/testedge"
       ]
   }
   ```

After receiving your HTTP response, Agora starts forwarding the live stream to the specified third-party platforms.
