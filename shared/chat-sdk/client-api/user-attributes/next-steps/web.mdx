### Manage user avatar

The <Vg k="CHAT_SDK"/> only supports storing the URL address of the avatar file rather than the file itself. To manage user avatars, you need to use a third-party file storage service.

To implement user avatar management in your app, take the following steps:

1. Upload the avatar file to the third-party file storage service. Once the file is successfully uploaded, you get a URL address of the avatar file.
2. Set the `avatarUrl` parameter in user attributes as the URL address of the avatar file.
3. To display the avatar, call `fetchUserInfoById` to retrieve the URL of the avatar file, and then render the image on the local UI.

### Create and send a namecard using user attributes

Namecard messages are custom messages that include the user ID, nickname, avatar, email address, and phone number of the specified user. To create and send a namecard, take the following steps:

1. Set the messsage type as `custom`.
2. Set the `customEvent` of the custom message as `userCard`.
3. Retrieve the values of `nickname`, `mail`, and `avatarurl` from the user attributes, and then set them as the the extension of the custom message using `customExts`.

Followings are the sample code for creating and sending a namecard message:

```javascript
// Set custom event type as userCard
const customEvent = "userCard";
// Set these attributes as the extension of the custom message using customExts.
const customExts = {
  nickname: "The nickname",
  avatarurl: "https://avatarurl",
  mail: "abc@gmail.com",
  phone: "phone number",
  gender: "female",
  birth: "2000-01-01",
  sign: "a sign",
};
const options = {
  // Set the message type.
  type: "custom",
  // Set the message recipient.
  to: "username",
  // Set the message event.
  customEvent,
  // Set the message content
  customExts,
  chatType: "singleChat",
};
// Create a custom message.
const msg = AgoraChat.message.create(options);
chatClient
  .send(msg)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log("Success");
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.log("error");
  });
```
