Real-time {props.product} immerses people in the sights and sounds of human connections, keeping them engaged in your {props.client} longer.

{props.product === 'Video Calling' ?
`${props.product} enables one-to-one or small-group video chat connections with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. ${props.company}’s ${props.sdk} makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native ${props.client}s.` :
`${props.product} enables you to host large-scale live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. ${props.company}’s ${props.sdk} makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native ${props.client}s.`
} Thanks to {props.company}’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network (SD-RTN™), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

{data.UIK} is a library that combines {props.company} real-time engagement functionality into a customizable user interface. Have another coffee, we have done all the work for you.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency {props.product} features into your {props.client} using UIKit.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you integrate into your app in order to achieve {props.product} functionality using UIKit.

![Image](/images/video-calling/video-call.png)

To using UIKit, you implement the following steps in your app:

- Create an instance of the viewer
  Declare and initialize an instance of the UIKit viewer.
- Join a channel
  - When you execute the join command, your app joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to Agora and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.
  - Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate {props.product} into your {props.client} using {props.sdk}, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement a client for the documentation template

When the user taps a button, the {props.client} joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the {props.client}. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing {props.company} features and not UX bells and whistles.

To integrate real-time video with a ready-made user interface into your {props.client} using UIKit:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented {props.product} in your {props.client}:

1. [Generate a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All#generate-a-temporary-token) in Agora Console.

2. In your browser, navigate to the [{props.company} web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _Join_.
