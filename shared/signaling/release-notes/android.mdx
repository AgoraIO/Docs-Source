### v2.2.0

v2.2.0 was released on June X, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This version optimizes the implementation of the following features, involving some API renaming, deletion, or behavior changes. To ensure the normal operation of the project, update the following code after updating to this version:

- The `createMetadata` method has been deleted. Modify your implementation using the following sample code:

    ```java
    // Before v2.2.0
    Metadata metadata = rtmClient.getStorage().createMetadata();
    ```

    ```java
    // v2.2.0
    Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
    ```

- The `StateItem` class is removed and the type of the following parameters is changed from `ArrayList<StateItem>` to `HashMap<String, String>`:

    - The `setState` parameter in `items`.
    - The `PresenceEvent` parameter in `stateItems`.
    - The `UserState` parameter in `states`.

    Refer to the corresponding API documentation to modify your implementation code.

- A `CERTIFICATION_VERIFY_FAILURE(22)` enumeration has been added in `RtmConnectionChangeReason` and the values of `STREAM_CHANNEL_NOT_AVAILABLE` and `INCONSISTENT_APPID` enumerations have been changed to `23` and `24`, respectively.

#### New features

1. Added privatization deployment capabilities

    This version adds a `privateConfig` parameter to `RtmConfig` to implement the private deployment function. For more information, see [Client configuration](../get-started/client-configuration?#private-deployment-configuration).

1. Added heartbeat time configuration

    This version adds a new `heartbeatInterval` parameter in `RtmConfig` to configure the interval at which the SDK sends heartbeat packets to the Signaling server. For more information, see [Client configuration](../core-functionality/connection-management#heartbeat-interval-and-presence-timeout-parameters).

1. Added dual environment configuration

    This release adds a new `protocolType` parameter in `RtmConfig` to customize the network transmission protocol to better adapt to your network environment. For more information, see [Client configuration](../get-started/client-configuration?#private-deployment-configuration).

1. Added a new user channel type

    This version adds a new `USER` type in `RtmChannelType`, which is used to send messages to specified users. This function can replace the peer-to-peer message function of Signaling v1.x.

1. Added a silent mode configuration

    This release adds `AgoraRtmSubscribeChannelFeatureBeQuiet` to the `AgoraRtmSubscribeChannelFeature` enumeration and `AgoraRtmJoinChannelFeatureBeQuiet` to the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelFeature` enumeration to allow silent subscription or joining a channel. When set, the user subscribes to or joins the channel silently, and other users in the channel cannot determine the user's presence status.

#### Improvements

1. Improved connection state management logic

    This version adds an `onLinkStateEvent` callback to replace the deprecated `onConnectionStateChanged` callback to better manage the connection status. See [Connection management](../core-functionality/connection-management) for details .

1. Improved `REMOTE_STATE_CHANGED` event notification logic

    This version improves the `REMOTE_STATE_CHANGED` triggering logic of the Presence event. That is, when a user sets or modifies multiple key-value pairs at a time, other users in the channel will only receive one event notification.

1. Added support for event notification trigger timestamp

    This release adds a `timestamp` parameter to the following data structure to report the timestamp that triggered the event notification:

    - `MessageEvent`
    - `PresenceEvent`
    - `TopicEvent`
    - `StorageEvent`
    - `LockEvent`

1. Optimized API behavior

    This version optimizes the behavior of the following APIs:

    - `login`: In the previous versions, calling this method multiple times in a row and passing an empty string in the method's `token` parameter were not supported. Starting from version 2.2.0, you can call this method multiple times in a row without calling the `logout` method in between. In addition, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK will use the app ID you passed in during initialization instead of the token, by default.
    - `subscribe`: In the previous versions, calling this method multiple times in a row was not supported. Starting from version 2.2.0, multiple consecutive calls to this method are supported.
    - `join`: In the previous versions, calling this method multiple times in a row and passing an empty string in the method's `token` parameter were not supported. Starting from version 2.2.0, this method can be called multiple times in a row. In addition, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK will use the app ID you passed in during initialization instead of the token, by default.

1. Modified the `presenceTimeout` value range

    This version changes the value range of the `presenceTimeout` parameter in `RtmConfig` from [10,300] to [5,300].

### v2.1.12

v2.1.12 was released on June X, 2024.

#### Improvements

This release includes the following improvements:

- For data synchronization errors caused by network issues, this release introduces a user logout mechanism, which ensures that the SDK automatically logs out of the Signaling system.
- Unsubscribing from a message channel during network disconnection will no longer return an error.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- During a disconnection with the Signaling system under poor network conditions, the user experienced errors when unsubscribing from a message channel.
- Under poor network conditions, the user occasionally failed to receive callbacks after a successful login.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the user occasionally could not receive the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props .ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the SDK occasionally failed to restore subscription relationships in the stream channel.
- Occasional failure to receive topic messages from web clients.

### v2.1.11

v2.1.11 was released on May 13, 2024.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the response mechanism when subscribing to or joining channels with the `withPresence=true` setting. If the user does not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypesnap[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification within 5 seconds, the SDK will report the <code>{code.presencenotready[props.ag_platform]}</code> error code in the `resultCallback` parameter.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- In specific scenarios, after logging out of the Signaling system and logging back in, occasional failures occurred when subscribing to or joining channels with the `withPresence=true` setting.
- In cases where the connection was lost due to network issues and then restored, if the local user actively called the <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to leave the channel, the remote user occasionally did not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypetimeout[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of the <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- Occasional failures occurred when frequently calling the <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{channel.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> methods.

### v2.1.10

v2.1.10 was released on March 11, 2024.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sending messages frequently, message sending occasionally timed out.
- After calling `renewToken` to renew the token, some services were not functioning correctly, resulting in unexpected disconnection.

### v2.1.9

v2.1.9 was released on February 22, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release improves message publishing options as follows:

- Removes the `sendTs` parameter and adds the `channelType` parameter in `PublishOptions`. See details in [`PublishOptions`](../reference/api/#messagepublishpropsag_platform).
- Modifies the type of the `options` parameter in the `publishTopicMessage` method from `PublishOptions` to `TopicMessageOptions`. See details in [`TopicMessageOptions`](../reference/api/#topicpublishpropsag_platform).

Make sure to modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

#### Improvements

This release adds the following improvements:

- Adds error codes: `INVALID_CHANNEL_TYPE`, `RTM_ERROR_INVALID_ENCRYPTION_PARAMETER`, and `RTM_ERROR_OPERATION_RATE_EXCEED_LIMITATION`. For error code descriptions and solutions, see [Error Codes](../reference/api#error-codes-table).
- Optimizes the handling logic for expired user status data during reconnection.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the occasional crash issue when calling the `getOnlineUsers` method to retrieve paginated results.

### v2.1.7

v2.1.7 was released on January 22, 2024.

#### New features

1. Stream Channel

    Experience seamless, delay-free data flow from one point to another. Stream channel solution refers to a real-time data pipeline that enables the uninterrupted flow of data from one point to another without delay or latency.

2. Pub/Sub

    Embrace asynchronous messaging, enabling instant communication between publishers and subscribers without the need for immediate responses. The pub/sub model is a messaging pattern used in real-time messaging solutions where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive messages from the channels they are subscribed to.

3. Topic

    Effectively manage data streams with topics, enabling seamless communications between users. Topic serves as a data flow management mechanism in the stream channel. It enables users to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events of data streams. Topics allow users to register as message publishers, send messages, and receive messages from subscribed publishers in a channel.

4. Storage

    Storage is important in signaling solutions to ensure reliable message delivery and prevent message loss or drop.

5. Removing Event Listeners

    This release adds the removeEventListener method. You can use it to remove a specified event listener.

6. Interval Mode

    This release supports the interval mode of presence function. When the number of online users in a channel exceeds the specified Announce Max value, the channel enters the interval mode. The SDK triggers the presence event notification at regular intervals and provides aggregated incremental information about user join, leave, timeout, and state changes in the interval property. For more details, see [Interval Mode](../reference/api#presence-event-types).

7. Locks

    Implement locks to maintain the sequence of messages, ensuring your data is processed in a specific order, preventing any data conflicts. When a client accesses a resource, it can acquire a lock on that resource to prevent other clients from accessing it.
