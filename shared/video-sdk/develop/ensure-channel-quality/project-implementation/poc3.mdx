### Import the required Agora libraries

    <ImportLibrary />

### Declare the required variables

    <SetDeclarations/>

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
### Use a probe test to check network health

    <ProbeTest />

### Implement best practice for app initiation

    Use the following <Vg k="VSDK" /> features when you set up an instance of the <Vg k="ENGINE" />:

    * _Enable and configure logging_: For optimization and debugging.
    * _Enable dual stream mode_: Required for multi-user scenarios.
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
    * _Set an audio profile and audio scenario_: Setting an audio profile is optional and only required if you have special requirements such as streaming  music.
    </PlatformWrapper>
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
    * _Set the video profile_: Setting a video profile is also optional. It is useful when you want to change one or more of `mirrorMode`, `frameRate`, `bitrate`, `dimensions`, `orientationMode`, `degradationPrefer` or `compressionPrefer` from the default setting to custom values.
        For more information, see  [video profile table](#video-profile-table).

### Test the user's hardware

    The echo test checks that the user's hardware is working properly.

    <TestHardware />

### Switch stream quality

    Take advantage of dual-stream mode and switch remote video quality to high or low.

    <SwitchQuality />

### Set the latency level

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
    For ultra low-latency applications, set the appropriate audience latency level when joining a channel. Ultra-low latency is a feature of <Vg k="ILS" /> and its use is subject to special [pricing](../overview/pricing#unit-pricing).
