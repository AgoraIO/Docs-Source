If the reconnection is successful, the current logged-in device will be forced to log out by default (for multiple devices, the earliest logged-in device will be logged out). If you want to keep the current device logged in, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a>. In this scenario, the device that logs in automatically won't be able to log in and will receive error 214, indicating that the number of currently logged-in devices exceeds the limit.</td>

The logged-out device will receive the `ConnectionListener#onLogout` callback. Agora Chat only supports forced logout for the devices on the same end.</td>
