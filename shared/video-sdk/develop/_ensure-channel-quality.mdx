Customer satisfaction for your <Vg k="VIDEO"/> integrated <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> depends on the quality of video and audio it provides. Quality of audiovisual communication through your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is affected by the following factors:

* **Bandwidth of network connection**: Bandwidth is the volume of information that an Internet connection can handle per unit of time. When the available bandwidth is not sufficient to transmit the amount of data necessary to provide the desired video quality, your users see jerky or frozen video along with audio that cuts in and out.

* **Stability of network connection**: Network connections are often unstable with the network quality going up and down. Users get temporarily disconnected and come back online after an interruption. These issues lead to a poor audiovisual experience for your users unless your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> is configured to respond to these situations and take remedial actions.

* **Hardware quality**: The camera and microphone used to capture video and audio must be of sufficiently good quality. If the user's hardware does not capture the audiovisual information in suitably high definition, it limits the quality of audio and video that is available to the remote user.

* **Video and audio settings**: The sharpness, smoothness, and overall quality of the video is directly linked to the frame rate, bitrate and other video settings. Similarly, the audio quality depends on the sample rate, bitrate, number of channels and other audio parameters. If you do not choose proper settings, the audio and video transmitted are of poor quality. On the other hand, if the settings are too demanding, the available bandwidth quickly gets choked, leading to suboptimal experience for your users.

* **Echo**: Echo is produced when your audio signal is played by a remote user through a speakerphone or an external device. This audio is captured by the remote user's microphone and sent back to you. Echo negatively affects audio quality, making speech difficult to understand. 

* **Multiple users in a channel**: When multiple users engage in real-time audio and video communication in a channel, the available bandwidth is quickly used up due to several incoming audio and video streams. The device performance also deteriorates due to the excessive workload required to decode and render multiple video streams.

<ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
* **Latency**: Latency is the time it takes for a single video frame to transfer from the sender's camera to the receiver's display. Network routers are the most common cause of latency on the end-to-end path. Satellite communication also adds significant latency to audio and video streaming.
</ProductWrapper>

This page shows you how to use <Vg k="VSDK"/> features to account for these factors and ensure optimal audio and video quality in your {props.PRODUCT} <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="VSDK"/> provides the following features to deal with channel quality issues:

* **Network probe test**: The network probe test checks the last-mile network quality before you join a channel. The method returns network quality statistics including round-trip latency, packet loss rate, and network bandwidth.

* **Echo test**: The echo test captures audio through the microphone on the user’s device, and sends it to <Vg k = "AGORA_BACKEND"/>. After a short delay, <Vg k = "AGORA_BACKEND"/> sends the audio back to the sender to be played. The quality of the returned audio enables a user to judge if their hardware and network connection are adequate. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends that an echo test be performed before a network probe test.

* **Audio profiles**: Delivering the best quality audio to your users requires choosing audio settings customized for your particular application. In <Vg k="VSDK"/> you can choose from pre-configured audio profiles and audio scenarios to optimize audio settings for a wide range of applications.

    * An _audio profile_ sets the audio sample rate, bitrate, encoding scheme, and the number of channels for your audio. <Vg k="VSDK"/> offers several preset audio profiles to choose from. To pick the most suitable audio profile for your application, refer to the [List of audio profiles](#list-of-audio-profiles).
    
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">

    * An _audio scenario_ specifies the audio performance in terms of volume, audio quality, and echo cancellation. Based on the nature of your application, you can pick the most suitable option from the [List of audio scenarios](#list-of-audio-scenarios). 
    
    </PlatformWrapper>

* **Video profiles**: In real-time engagement scenarios, user experience is closely tied to the sharpness, smoothness, and overall quality of the video. In <Vg k="VSDK"/> you can set the video dimensions, framerate, bitrate, orientation mode, and mirror mode by specifying a video profile. You can also set the degradation preference to specify how video quality is degraded under suboptimal network conditions. To find the suitable bitrate for a given combination of dimensions and framerate, refer to the [Video profile table](#video-profile-table).

* **In-call quality statistics**: <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides several callbacks and methods to monitor channel quality in real-time. These methods and callbacks provide vital statistics to evaluate communication quality and provide the information necessary to take remedial actions. <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides you the following statistics :

    * _Network quality_: The uplink and downlink network quality in terms of the transmission bitrate, packet loss rate, average Round-Trip Time, and jitter in your network.

    * _Call quality_: Information on the current user session and the resources being used by the channel in terms of the number of users in a channel, packet loss rate, CPU usage and call duration. Use these statistics to troubleshoot call quality issues. 

    * _Local audio quality_: Local audio measurements such as audio channels, sample rate, sending bitrate, and packet loss rate in the audio stream. 

    * _Remote audio quality_: These statistics provide information such as the number of channels, received bitrate, jitter in the audio stream, audio loss rate, and packet loss rate.

    * _Local video quality_: Local video quality statistics such as packet loss rate, frame rate, encoded frame width, and sent bitrate. 

    * _Remote video quality_: These statistics include information about the width and height of video frames, packet loss rate, receiving stream type, and bitrate in the reported interval. 

    * _Video and Audio states_: <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> reports the new state, and the reason for state change, whenever the state of an audio or video stream changes.

* **Dual stream mode**: In dual-stream mode, <Vg k="VSDK"/> transmits a high-quality and a low-quality video stream from the sender. The high-quality stream has higher resolution and bitrate than the the low-quality video stream. Remote users subscribe to the low-quality stream to improve communication continuity as it reduces bandwidth consumption. Subscribers should also choose the low-quality video streams when network condition are unreliable, or when multiple users publish streams in a channel.

* **Video stream fallback**: When network conditions deteriorate, <Vg k="VSDK"/> automatically switches the video stream from high-quality to low-quality, or disables video to ensure audio delivery. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> continues to monitor the network quality after fallback, and restores the video stream when network conditions allow it. To improve communication quality under extremely poor network conditions, implement a fallback option in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
* **Ultra-low latency**: Agora’s <Vg k="ILS" /> keeps audiences engaged at ultra low latency (400–800 ms). This is ideal for applications requiring high interactivity from the audience such as talk shows, sports broadcasts and live auctions.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
* **Low latency**: Agora’s <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> keeps audiences engaged at low latency (1,500–2,000 ms). This is ideal for applications that require limited interactivity from the audience such as podcasts, gaming streams and other virtual events.
</ProductWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
* **Transmission optimization modes**: Under poor network conditions, you usually have to choose between clarity and smoothness. The best strategy depends on your particular scenario:
    - Some scenarios tolerate frozen images, but these images must be clear.
    - Some scenarios allow slightly blurry images in poor network conditions, but cannot tolerate any freeze.

    Based on these requirements, the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Web SDK supports the following two transmission optimization strategies:
    - *Prioritize clarity*:
        - The SDK ensures high-quality images by automatically calculating a minimum bitrate based on the capturing resolution and frame rate. No matter how poor the network condition is, the sending bitrate will never be lower than the minimum value.
        - In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the sending resolution, but may reduce the frame rate.
    - *Prioritize smoothness*:
        - In poor network conditions, the SDK reduces the sending bitrate to minimize video freezes.
        - In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the frame rate, but may reduce the sending resolution.
</PlatformWrapper>

* **Video for multiple users**: When multiple users join a channel, several incoming high-quality video streams negatively impact network and device performance. In such cases, you can manage the excess load by playing high-quality video from the user who has focus, and low quality streams from all other users. To implement this feature, it is necessary for all users in the channel to enable the dual stream mode.

* **Echo cancellation when playing audio files**: <Vg k="VSDK"/> offers audio mixing functionality to play media in a channel. You can mix a local or online audio file with the audio captured through the microphone, or completely replace the microphone audio. Audio mixing takes advantage of the echo cancellation features of <Vg k="VSDK"/> to reduce echo in a channel. Refer to [Audio and voice effects](../enable-features/audio-and-voice-effects) to learn more about audio mixing in <Vg k="VSDK"/>.

* **Connection state monitoring**: The connection state between an <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> and <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> changes when the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> joins or leaves a channel, or goes offline due to network or authentication issues. <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides connection state monitoring to detect when and why a network connection is interrupted. When the connection state changes, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> sends a callback to notify the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. <Vg k="VSDK"/> then automatically tries to reconnect to the server to restore the connection.

<ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
* **Video profiles for screen sharing**: To provide a jitter-free and smooth game streaming experience to your audience, use <Vg k="VSDK"/> to set a suitable video profile when a user live-streams a gaming session. You can adjust the frame rate, resolution, and bitrate to improve the audience's viewing experience.
</ProductWrapper>

- **Log files**: <Vg k="VSDK"/> provides configuration options that you use to customize the location, content and size of log files containing key data of <Vg k="VSDK"/> operation. When you set up logging, <Vg k="VSDK"/> writes information messages, warnings, and errors regarding activities such as initialization, configuration, connection and disconnection to log files. Log files are useful in detecting and resolving channel quality issues.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to ensure channel quality in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>:

### Recommended Video Settings

The recommended video settings vary by scenario. For example, in a one-to-one online class, the video windows of the teacher and student are both large, which calls for higher resolutions, frame rate, and bitrate. However, in a one-to-many online class, the video windows are smaller. You can set lower resolution, frame rate, and bitrate to accommodate bandwidth limitations.
The recommended settings for these different scenarios are:

- One-to-one video call:

    - Resolution: 320 x 240; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 200 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 640 x 360; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 400 Kbps.

- One-to-many video call:

    - Resolution: 160 x 120; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 65 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 320 x 180; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 140 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 320 x 240; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 200 Kbps.

In practice, different user devices, user network conditions, application service locations, and user requirements affect which kinds of video profiles you use. Therefore, if the recommended video profiles are not suitable for you, contact technical support for assistance.

### Mirror mode

By default, <Vg k="VSDK"/> does not mirror the video during encoding. You can use the `mirrorMode` parameter to decide whether to mirror the video that remote users see.

### Connection states

When the connection state changes, Agora sends the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback. The following diagram illustrates the various states and how the states change as a client app joins and leaves a channel:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1630290002743)

When the network connection is interrupted, the SDK automatically tries to reconnect to the server. The following diagram shows the callbacks received by the local user (UID1) and the remote user (UID2) when the local user joins the channel, gets a network exception, lises connection, and rejoins the channal.

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1630290020302)

As shown in the above diagram:

- T0: The SDK receives the `joinChannel` request from UID1.
- T1: 200 ms after calling `joinChannel`, UID1 joins the channel. In the process, UID1 also receives the `onConnectionStateChanged(CONNECTING, CONNECTING)` callback. When successfully joining the channel, UID 1 receives the `onConnectionStateChanged(CONNECTED, JOIN_SUCCESS)` and `onJoinChannelSuccess` callbacks.
- T2: 100 ms after UID1 joins the channel, UID2 receives the `onUserJoined` callback.
- T3: The uplink network condition of UID1 deteriorates. The SDK automatically tries rejoining the channel.
- T4: If UID1 fails to receive any data from the server in four seconds, UID1 receives `onConnectionStateChanged(RECONNCTING, INTERRUPTED)`; meanwhile the SDK continues to try rejoining the channel.
- T5: If UID1 fails to receive any data from the server in ten seconds, UID1 receives `onConnectionLost`; meanwhile the SDK continues to try rejoining the channel.
- T6: If UID2 fails to receive any data from UID1 in 20 seconds, the SDK decides that UID1 is offline. UID2 receives `onUserOffline`.
- T7: If UID1 fails to rejoin the channel in 20 minutes, the SDK stops trying to rejoin the channel. UID1 receives `onConnectionStateChanged(FAILED, JOIN_FAILED)`.
