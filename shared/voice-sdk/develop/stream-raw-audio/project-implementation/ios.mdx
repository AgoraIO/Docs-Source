### Process raw audio data

To register and use an audio frame observer in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1. **Setup the audio frame observer**

    The `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate` gives you access to each audio frame after it is captured or before it is played back. To setup the `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate`, add the following `extension` to the `ViewController`:

    ```swift
    extension ViewController: AgoraAudioFrameDelegate {
        // Occurs when the recorded audio frame is received
        func onRecord(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame, channelId: String) -> Bool {
            // true: The recorded audio frame is valid and is encoded and sent
            // false: The recorded audio frame is invalid and is not encoded or sent
            return false
        }

        // Occurs when the playback audio frame is received
        func onPlaybackAudioFrame(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame, channelId: String) -> Bool {
            // true: The playback audio frame is valid and is encoded and sent
            // false: The playback audio frame is invalid and is not encoded or sent
            return false
        }

        // Occurs when the mixed audio data is received
        func onMixedAudioFrame(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame, channelId: String) -> Bool {
            // true: The mixed audio data is valid and is encoded and sent
            // false: The mixed audio data is invalid and is not encoded or sent
            return false
        }

        // Occurs when the ear monitoring audio frame is received
        func onEarMonitoringAudioFrame(_ frame: AgoraAudioFrame) -> Bool {
            // true: The ear monitoring audio frame is valid and is encoded and sent
            // false: The ear monitoring audio frame is invalid and is not encoded or sent
            return false
        }

        // Occurs when the before-mixing playback audio frame is received
        func onPlaybackAudioFrame(beforeMixing frame: AgoraAudioFrame, channelId: String, uid: UInt) -> Bool {
            // true: The before-mixing playback audio frame is valid and is encoded and sent
            // false: The before-mixing playback audio frame is invalid and is not encoded or sent
            return false
        }
    }
    ```

1. **Register the audio frame observer**

    To receive the callbacks that you declared in `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate`, you must register the audio frame observer with the <Vg k="ENGINE" />, before joining a channel. To specify the format of the audio frames captured by each `AgoraAudioFrameDelegate` callback, use the `setRecordingAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate`, `setPlaybackAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate` and `setMixedAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate` methods.

    To do this, add the following lines after `if await !self.checkForPermissions() {}` in the `joinChannel` method:

    ```swift
    agoraEngine.setAudioFrameDelegate(self)

    // Set the format of the captured raw audio data.
    let sampleRate = 16000, sampleNumOfChannels = 1, samplesPerCall = 1024

    agoraEngine.setRecordingAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate(sampleRate, channel: sampleNumOfChannels,
                                                            mode: AgoraAudioRawFrameOperationMode.readWrite, samplesPerCall: samplesPerCall)
    agoraEngine.setPlaybackAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate(sampleRate, channel: sampleNumOfChannels,
                                                            mode: AgoraAudioRawFrameOperationMode.readWrite, samplesPerCall: samplesPerCall)
    agoraEngine.setMixedAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate(sampleRate, channel: sampleNumOfChannels, samplesPerCall: samplesPerCall)
    ```

1. **Unregister the audio frame observer when you leave a channel**

    When you leave a channel, you unregister the frame observer by calling the register frame observer method again with a `nil` argument. To do this, add the following line to the `leaveChannel()` function before `agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)`:

    ```swift
    agoraEngine.setAudioFrameDelegate(nil)
    ```
