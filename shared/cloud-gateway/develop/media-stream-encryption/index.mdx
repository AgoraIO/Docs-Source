During real-time audio and video interactions, encrypting media streams ensures user data security. The <Vpd k="NAME" /> offers a built-in encryption solution to safeguard your media streams effectively.

## Implementation

Starting from version 3.8.200, Agora recommends using the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption modes with key and salt settings. Versions prior to 3.8.200 only support 128-bit SM4 in ECB mode.

Agora recommends using the `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2` encryption mode and setting the key and salt.

<Admonition type="info">
- Ensure all users in a channel use the same encryption mode, key, and salt.
- The `GCM2` encryption modes offer enhanced security with a stronger Key Derivation Function (KDF) and support for setting a salt. For other encryption modes, you only need to configure the encryption mode and key.
</Admonition>

### Generate and set the key
To generate and set the encryption `key`, refer to the following steps.

1. To randomly generate a 32-byte encryption key in string format using OpenSSL on your server:

    ```shell
    # Randomly generate a 32-byte key in the string format, and pass the string key in the encryptionKey parameter of enableEncryption.
    openssl rand -hex 32
    dba643c8ba6b6dc738df43d9fd624293b4b12d87a60f518253bd10ba98c48453
    ```

2. The client gets the string `key` from the server and passes it to the SDK in the `enableEncryption` method.

### Generate and set the salt

To generate the `salt`:

1. Randomly generate a Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt through OpenSSL on the server. Refer to the [C++ sample code](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools/blob/master/DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey/cpp/sample/RtcChannelEncryptionSaltSample.cpp) provided by Agora on GitHub to randomly generate a salt in the byte array format and convert it to `Base64` on the server.

    ```shell
    # Randomly generate a 32-byte salt in the Base64 format. Convert the salt from Base64 to uint8_t, and pass the uint8_t salt in the encryptionKdfSalt parameter of enableEncryption.
    openssl rand -base64 32
    X5w9T+50kzxVOnkJKiY/lUk82/bES2kATOt3vBuGEDw=
    ```

2. The client gets the `Base64` salt from the server.

3. The client converts the salt from `Base64` to a `uint8_t` array of length 32, and then passes it to the SDK in the `enableEncryption` method.

### Enable built-in encryption

Before connecting to a channel, call `enableEncryption` to enable built-in encryption. You also need to set the encryption mode and encryption key. All users connected to the same channel must use the same encryption mode and key.
