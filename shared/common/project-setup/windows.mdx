1. Clone this Git repository for sample code for windows by executing the following command in a terminal window:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-windows
    ```
2. Replace the `<root>/agora_manager/SDK` with the latest Agora Video SDK, you downloaded and unzipped to a local folder.
3. Create a folder at your solution directory (`<root>/agora_manager`) named `<selected solution platform(x64 or x86)>/<selected solution Configuration Mode(Debug or Release)>` like for this sample create a nested folder (`x64/Debug`).To achieve this, first create a folder named `x64`, and then within that folder, create another folder named `Debug`.
4. Copy the contents of `<root>/agora_manager/SDK/x86_64` to  `<root>/agora_manager/x64/Debug`.
5. **Install the required third party liberaries through vcpkg:**

	Follow the link [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) to install required library. Please note we need to install x64-windows version of librarry, as this sample is 64-bit version of Windows. For example in a given sample to read config.json, `jsoncpp` lib is used. in nutshell below steps required:
	 ```bash
	 1. Open CMD and navigate to your project Directory <root>:
	 1. git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git  -- execute once during vcpkg setup
	 2. cd vcpkg
	 3. .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat   -- execute once during vcpkg setup
	 4. .\vcpkg.exe install jsoncpp:x64-windows  -- execute specific command for each specific liberary (project specific third parties installation vcpkg commands given below)
	 ```
	**Project specific third parties library requirement :**
	
	```bash
	-- for base project and SDK quickstart(agora_manager and get_started):
		.\vcpkg.exe install jsoncpp:x64-windows
		.\vcpkg.exe install curl:x64-windows
   ```
