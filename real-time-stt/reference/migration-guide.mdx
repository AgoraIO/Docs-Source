  How to migrate from real-time STT 5.x to 6.x.
---

export const toc = [{}];

Version 5.x of <Vpd k="NAME" /> focused on flexibility, reserving many parameters and capabilities for future expansion, such as cross-channel subtitle push. However, this flexibility introduced complexity in integration. In contrast, v6.x prioritizes simplicity by removing redundant fields while also introducing new features, such as supporting UID language functions and eliminating destination fields.

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
The Real-Time STT v5.x has entered a frozen development state. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> strongly recommends migrating to v6.x.
</Admonition>

This page explains how to migrate from v5.x to v6.x.

### What has changed

The Real-Time STT v6.x introduces a more streamlined approach by removing certain functions that were available in v5.x. Hereâ€™s what has changed:

1. **Cross-channel audio subscription and subtitle push removed**

    * **v5.x**: You could subscribe to audio from Channel A and push the transcribed or translated subtitles to Channel B.
    * **v6.x**: This is no longer supported. The Real-Time STT v6.x only allows subscribing to audio within the same channel and pushing subtitles to that same channel.

1. **Multi-OSS/S3 storage for subtitle files removed**

    * **v5.x**: You could store subtitle files in multiple OSS/S3 storage locations.
    * **v6.x**: You can only upload subtitles to a single OSS/S3 storage location.

1. **Redundant fields removed**

    * Some unnecessary fields such as `config.recognizeConfig.model` and `audio.subscribeSource` have been removed to simplify real-time REST API.

These changes are aimed at reducing complexity and making real-time STT more efficient.

### Migrate to v6.x manually

The following figure highlights the v5.x configuration changes.

1. **Channel and user authentication changes**  
    - **v5.x:** `channelName`, `uid`, `token`  are specified under `agoraRtcConfig.`
    - **v6.x:** Replaced by `channelName`, `subBotUid`, and `subBotToken` inside the `rtcConfig` structure.  

2. **Idle time setting**  
    - **v5.x:** `maxIdleTime` is specified under `agoraRtcConfig.`
    - **v6.x:** Replaced by the `maxIdleTime` field at the top level of the structure.

3. **Language configuration**  
    - **v5.x:** `language` is a comma-separated string for multiple languages under `recognizeConfig`.
    - **v6.x:** Replaced by `languages` array at the top level. Each language is now an individual item in the array.  

4. **Publisher bot authentication**  
    - **v5.x:** `uid` and `token` are specified under `agoraRTCDataStream`.
    - **v6.x:** Replaced by `pubBotUid` and `pubBotToken` in the `rtcConfig` structure.  

5. **Storage configuration changes**  
    - **v5.x:** `storageConfig`  is under `config.recognizeConfig.output.cloudStorage`
    - **v6.x:** Replaced by `captionConfig.storage`, with all fields mapped one-to-one.  

6. **Translation configuration**  
    - **v5.x:** `translateConfig` structure is under `config` 
    - **v6.x:** Directly replaced by the `translateConfig` structure at the top level.

The equivalent configuration for v6.x is as follows:

```json
{
  "languages": [
    "en-US"
  ],
  "maxIdleTime": 21600,
  "rtcConfig": {
    "channelName": "agora-test",
    "subBotToken": "1111-token",
    "subBotUid": "1111",
    "pubBotUid": "2222",
    "pubBotToken": "2222-token"
  },
  "translateConfig": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "source": "en-US",
        "target": [
          "zh-CN"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "captionConfig": {
    "storage": {
      "accessKey": "your_storage_access_key",
      "secretKey": "your_storage_secret_key",
      "bucket": "your_storage_bucket_name",
      "vendor": 1,
      "region": 0,
      "fileNamePrefix": [
        "test-file"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Migrate using a Go script

To convert a v5.x REST API to v6.x, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides a [Go script](https://goplay.tools/snippet/FnxvFiaFRW1). To use this script:

1. Replace the highlighted area in the rectangular box with your v5.x REST API.
1. Click **Run** to generate the v6.x request body.
1. Use the v6.x REST API to start an STT task and compare it with the v5.x version to check for differences.
