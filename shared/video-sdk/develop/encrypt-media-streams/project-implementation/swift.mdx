To add built-in media stream encryption to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following steps:

<KeyAndSalt />

2. Implement client-side logic

    1. To manually add the encryption library to your project:
        1. Copy the `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework` file from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/> package to your project folder.

        1. Open Xcode, go to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu.

        1. Click **`+`** and choose **Add Other...**, then add `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework`.

        1. To ensure that the dynamic library's signature is consistent with the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />'s signature, set the **Embed** attribute of the dynamic library to **Embed & Sign**.

        <Admonition type="caution" title="note">Apple requires that an app's extension not contain dynamic libraries. If you need to integrate the SDK into a dynamic library within an extension, change the file's status to **Do Not Embed**.</Admonition>

        For more integration methods, see [other integration methods](#integrate-encryption-library-with-cocoapods).

    1. To import the `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader` library, add the following line to the `ViewController.swift` file:

        ```swift
        import AgoraRtcCryptoLoader
        ```

    1. Get the String key and Base64-encoded salt from the server.

    1. Convert the salt from Base64 to `uint8_t`.

    1. Before joining the channel, call `enableEncryption` to set the encryption mode, and pass the key and salt to the SDK.

    <Admonition type="caution" title="note" >
    - All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt. Discrepancies may lead to unexpected behavior, such as black screens or audio loss.
    - To ensure security, best practice is to use a new key and salt each time you enable media stream encryption.
    </Admonition>

    To implement this logic, refer to the following code:

    ```swift
    func getEncryptionSaltFromServer() -> Data {
        // Convert the Base64 encoded salt to uint8_t
        return "EncryptionKdfSaltInBase64Strings".data(using: .utf8)!
    }

    // Create an instance of AgoraEncryptionConfig
    let config = AgoraEncryptionConfig()
    // Set the encryption mode to AgoraEncryptionMode.AES128GCM2
    config.encryptionMode = .AES128GCM2
    // Obtain the Base64 encoded salt from the server
    config.encryptionKdfSalt = getEncryptionKdfSaltBase64FromServer()
    // Obtain the String type key from the server
    config.encryptionKey = getEncryptionKeyFromServer()
    let ret = agoraKit.enableEncryption(true, encryptionConfig: config)
        if ret != 0 {
            self.showAlert(title: "Error", message: "enableEncryption call failed: \(ret), please check your params")
    }
    ```
