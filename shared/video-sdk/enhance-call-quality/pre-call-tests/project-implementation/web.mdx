### Equipment quality test

You test the recording and playback devices separately.

#### Recording equipment testing

Refer to the following steps to test the local microphone and camera:

1. Call `AgoraRTC.getDevices` to get the available devices and their IDs.

1. When calling `AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack` and `AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack` to create local audio and video track objects, pass in `cameraId` and `microphoneId` to specify the devices you want to test.

1. After creating the local audio or video track object, call `CameraVideoTrack.play` to play the local video track:

    1. If you are testing the microphone, call `MicrophoneAudioTrack.getVolumeLevel` to get the volume level. If the volume is greater than `0`, it means that the microphone is working normally.

    1. When testing the camera, if you see the picture after playing the video track, it means that the camera is working normally.

To implement recording equipment tests in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:


``` javascript
// Get all audio and video devices
AgoraRTC.getDevices()
  .then(devices => {
    const audioDevices = devices.filter(function(device){
        return device.kind === "audioinput";
    });
    const videoDevices = devices.filter(function(device){
        return device.kind === "videoinput";
    });

    var selectedMicrophoneId = audioDevices[0].deviceId;
    var selectedCameraId = videoDevices[0].deviceId;
    return Promise.all([
      AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack({ cameraId: selectedCameraId }),
      AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack({ microphoneId: selectedMicrophoneId }),
    ]);
  })
  .then([videoTrack, audioTrack] => {
    videoTrack.play("<ELEMENT_ID_IN_DOM>");
    setInterval(() => {
      const level = audioTrack.getVolumeLevel();
      console.log("local stream audio level", level);
    }, 1000);
  });
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- Best practice is to draw the volume change and camera screen on the UI so that users can judge if the device is working properly.
- Device IDs are randomly generated, and in some cases the ID of the same device may change. Best practice is to call `AgoraRTC.getDevices` to get the device ID every time you test the device.
</Admonition>

#### Playback device testing

The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDK for Web does not provide an API for testing audio playback devices. Use the following methods to test the audio playback devices:

- Create an audio player on the page using the HTML5 `<audio>` element. Prompt the user to play the audio file and confirm that the sound is audible.

- After capturing the microphone audio, call `MicrophoneAudioTrack.play` to play the microphone sound and prompt the user to subjectively verify that the playback is audible.

### Network quality analysis

Refer to the following steps to perform a network quality test before a call or live broadcast:

1. Call `createClient` twice, to create two clients:
    - `uplinkClient`: To test the connection status of the uplink network.
    - `downlinkClient`: To test the connection status of the downlink network.

1. Both clients call `join` to enter a channel for testing.

1. Call `createMicrophoneAndCameraTracks` to create audio and video tracks.

1. Call `publish` on `uplinkClient` to publish audio and video tracks and `subscribe` on `downlinkClient` to subscribe to audio and video tracks.

1. Listen to the `uplinkClient.on("network-quality")` event to get the uplink network status between the local device and <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server.

1. Listen to `downlinkClient.on("network-quality")` event to get the downlink network status between the local device and the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server. The SDK triggers the `client.on("network-quality")` callback every two seconds.

1. To get specific statistics about the sent or received media tracks, such as send/receive bitrate, end-to-end latency, call `getLocalAudioStats` and `getLocalVideoStats` on `uplinkClient` to get the uplink statistics, and `getRemoteAudioStats` and `getRemoteVideoStats` on `downlinkClient` to get the downlink statistics. 

The following figure summarizes the calling sequence of network quality tests:

   </details>

To implement network quality testing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, refer to the following code:

``` typescript
// Get uplink network quality
uplinkClient.on("network-quality", (quality) => {
  console.log("uplink network quality", quality.uplinkNetworkQuality);
});

// Get downlink network quality
downlinkClient.on("network-quality", (quality) => {
  console.log("downlink network quality", quality.downlinkNetworkQuality);
});

// Get uplink statistics
uplinkVideoStats = uplinkClient.getLocalVideoStats();
// Get downlink statistics
downlinkVideoStats = downlinkClient.getRemoteVideoStats()[<UPLINKCLIENT_UID>];

console.log("uplink video stats", uplinkVideoStats);
console.log("downlink video stats", downlinkVideoStats);
```
