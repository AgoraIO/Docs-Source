By default, <Vg k="VSDK" /> uses the basic audio and video modules on the device your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> runs on. However, there are certain scenarios where you want to integrate a custom audio or video source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as:

* Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has its own audio or video module.
* You want to use a non-camera source, such as recorded screen data.
* You need to process the captured audio or video with a pre-processing library for audio or image enhancement.
* You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

## Understand the tech

To set an external audio or video source, you configure the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> before joining a channel. To manage the capture and processing of audio and video frames, you use methods from outside the <Vg k="VSDK" /> that are specific to your custom source. <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to push processed audio and video data to the subscribers in a channel.

The figure below shows the workflow you need to implement to stream a custom video or audio source in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

By default, <Vpd k="SDK" /> uses the standard audio module on the device your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> runs on. However, there are certain scenarios where you want to integrate a custom audio source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as:

* Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has its own audio module.

* You want to use a non-microphone source, such as recorded audio data.

* You need to process the captured audio with a pre-processing library for audio enhancement.

* You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.
