### Adjust the playback volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```typescript
// Set the local playback volume to 50 for all remote users 
engine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(50);
// Set the local playback volume for a specific remote user. For example, user with uid 12
engine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(12, 50);
```

### Adjust the recording volume

Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```typescript
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
engine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(50);
```

When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
* A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
* If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
* The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
* If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Get volume information of users

<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback. You use the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note" style="background-color:yellow">Call `enableAudioVolumeIndication` to enable reporting of the users' volume in the callback.</Admonition>
```typescript
// Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
// their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
onAudioVolumeIndication?(
    connection: RtcConnection,
    speakers: AudioVolumeInfo[],
    speakerNumber: number,
    totalVolume: number
  ): void;
```
