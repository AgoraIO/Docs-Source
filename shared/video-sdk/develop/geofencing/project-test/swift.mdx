6. Try excluding a region from <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

    In Xcode, in `ViewController`, locate the `initializeAgoraEngine` method and replace `agoraRtcEngineConfig.areaCode = AgoraAreaCode.NA.rawValue` with the following code:
    ```swift
    // Exclude Mainland China from the regions for connection.
    config.areaCode = AgoraAreaCodeType(rawValue: AgoraAreaCodeType.global.rawValue ^ AgoraAreaCodeType.CN.rawValue)!
    ```
