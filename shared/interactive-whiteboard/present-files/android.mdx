The Agora Fastboard SDK supports inserting and displaying multiple types of files on the whiteboard, such as images, audio and video, and documents. This enables users to quickly share information in compelling ways in order to create an immersive experience.

This page describes how to call the Fastboard SDK's APIs to insert images, present documents, and play audio and video on the whiteboard.

## Insert Images

<Vg k="FAST" /> provides the [`insertImage`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertimage) method for inserting and displaying an image in the main window of the whiteboard. You can call this method and pass in the URL, width, and height of the image to display a specified image.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the image. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the image cannot be displayed properly.

- Make sure that the image is in PNG, JPG/JPEG, or WEBP format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement inserting an image in the [Join the whiteboard room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. In `/app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity`, replace `fastRoom.join()` with the following code:

    ``` java
        // Joins the whiteboard room
        fastRoom.join { room ->
            // Calls `insertImage`, and pass in the URL, width, and height of the image
            room.`insertImage`("https://flat-storage.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/cloud-storage/2022-02/15/ebe8320a-a90e-4e03-ad3a-a5dc06ae6eda/ebe8320a-a90e-4e03-ad3a-a5dc06ae6eda.png", 512, 512)
        }
    ```

2. Run the project. You can see the inserted image on the whiteboard after the app refreshes.

<Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for <code>insertImage</code>. You need to implement the UI yourself.

## Play audio and video

The <Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the media player extension and provides the [`insertVideo`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertvideo) method for playing audio and video files. You can simply call `insertVideo
` and pass in the URL of the audio or video file and the title of the sub-window play the audio and video in a sub-window on the whiteboard.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate the <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the audio or video. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the audio and video cannot be loaded properly.

- Make sure that the audio and video files are in MP3 or MP4 format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement playing a video in the [Join the whiteboard room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. In `/app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity`, replace `fastRoom.join()` with the following code:

        ``` java
        // Joins the whiteboard room
        fastRoom.join { room ->
                    // Calls insertVideo, and pass in the URL of the video file and the title of sub-window
                    room.insertVideo("https://flat-storage.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/cloud-storage/2022-02/15/55509848-5437-463e-b52c-f81d1319c837/55509848-5437-463e-b52c-f81d1319c837.mp4", "test1.mp4")
                }
        ```

2. Run the project. You can see the sub-window named `test1.mp4` after the app refreshes. Click the start button to play the video.

<Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for <code>insertVideo</code>. You need to implement the UI yourself.

## Present documents

<Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the docs viewer and slide extensions and provides the [`insertDocs`](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/uikit-sdk#insertdocs) method for presenting documents. You can simply call `insertDocs` and pass in the information on a document conversion task, such as the task UUID and token, to present the document in a paginated format in a sub-window on the whiteboard. The implementation workflow is as follows:

1. Upload the source document to a third-party cloud storage service, and call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](/interactive-whiteboard/reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion/#start-file-conversion) to create a file conversion task. When the call succeeds, the Agora server returns UUID in the response body, which is the UUID of the file conversion task.

2. Call the [Generate a Task Token (POST) API](/interactive-whiteboard/develop/generate-token-rest/), and pass the UUID in the request path to generate a task token for the file conversion task.

3. After joining the whiteboard room, call the `insertDocs` method, and pass the following information in the params parameter of the method:

    - `taskUUID`: String. The UUID of the file conversion task.

    - `taskToken`: String. The token of the file conversion task.

    - `fileType`: String. The file type `.pdf` represents a static document; `.pptx` represents a dynamic document.

    - `title`: String. The title of the sub-window.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-uikit/#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Understand and enable the [file-conversion service](/interactive-whiteboard/develop/file-conversion-overview).

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement presenting an animated PPTX document in the [Join the whiteboard room](../../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Upload the PPTX source document to a third-party cloud storage service and call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](../../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#start-file-conversion) to create a dynamic-file conversion task that converts the PPTX file to HTML web pages.

2. Launch a file conversion task and get the UUID and token of the task.

3. In `/app/java/com.example.<projectname>/MainActivity`, replace `fastRoom.join()` with the following code:

            ``` java
        // Joins the whiteboard room
        fastRoom.join { room ->
            // Parameterts of the converted document
            val params = FastInsertDocParams(
                "Task UUID",
                "Task Token",
                "pptx",
                "My PPT"
            )
            // Calls insertDocs to insert the converted document, and register the callbacks to get call results
            room.insertDocs(params, object : FastResult<String> {
                override fun onSuccess(value: String) {
                }
                override fun onError(exception: Exception?) {
                }
            })
        }
            ```
4. Run the project. You can see the sub-window named `My PPT` after the app refreshes. Click the arrow on the window to show your document page by page.
