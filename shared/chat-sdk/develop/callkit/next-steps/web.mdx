### Authenticate users with the RTC token

To enhance communication security, Agora recommends that you authenticate app users with the RTC token before they join a call. To do this, you need to make sure that the [Primary Certificate of your project is enabled](../reference/manage-agora-account#enable-the-primary-certificate).


Tokens are generated on your app server using the token generator provided by Agora. After you retrieve the token, pass the token to the callkit when calling `startCall` and `answerCall`. For how to generate a token on the server and retrieve and renew the token on the client, see <Link to="/video-calling/develop/authentication-workflow?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Authenticate Your Users with Tokens</Link>.
