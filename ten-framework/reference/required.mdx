  Required fields
---

In the TEN framework, only message schemas can include `required` fields. Extension properties cannot include `required` fields.

This means that schemas for `cmd_in`, `cmd_out`, `data_in`, `data_out`, `audio_frame_in`, `audio_frame_out`, `video_frame_in`, and `video_frame_out` can define `required` fields.

For message schemas, the `required` field is valid only in the following three locations:

- At the same level as `property` in `<foo>_in` or `<foo>_out`
- Inside the `property` of `result` in `<foo>_in` or `<foo>_out`
- Within a `property` of type `object` (for nested structures)

Examples of these scenarios are shown below.

```json
{
  "api": {
    "cmd_in": [
      {
        "name": "foo",
        "property": {
          "a": {
            "type": "int8"
          },
          "b": {
            "type": "uint8"
          },
          "c": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "d": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "e": {
                "type": "float32"
              }
            }
          },
          "exampleObject": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "foo": {
                "type": "int32"
              },
              "bar": {
                "type": "string"
              }
            },
            "required": ["foo"] // 3.
          }
        },
        "required": ["a", "b"], // 1.
        "result": {
          "property": {
            "ccc": {
              "type": "buf"
            },
            "detail": {
              "type": "buf"
            }
          },
          "required": ["ccc"] // 2.
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Use of `required`

### Message sent from an extension

When an extension calls `send_<foo>(msg_X)` or `return_result(result_Y)`, the framework checks `msg_X` or `result_Y` against their respective schemas in the extension. If `msg_X` or `result_Y` is missing any of the fields marked as `required` in the schema, the schema check fails, indicating an error.

The handling of these three scenarios is identical, though they are discussed separately:

1. If `send_<foo>` is sending a TEN command and the schema check fails:

   `send_<foo>` returns false immediately. If an error parameter is provided, it includes the schema check failure error message.

2. If `return_result` fails the schema check:

   `return_result` returns false. If an error parameter is provided, it includes the schema check failure error message.

3. If `send_<foo>` is sending a general data-like TEN message, such as data, audio frame, or video frame:

   `send_<foo>` returns false. If an error parameter is provided, it includes the schema check failure error message.

### Message received by an extension

Before TEN runtime passes `msg_X` or `result_Y` to an extension's `on*<foo>()` or result handler, it checks whether all `required` fields defined in the schema of `msg_X` or `result_Y` are present. If a `required` field is missing, the schema check fails.

1. If the incoming message is a TEN command:

   `ten_runtime` returns an error `status_code` result to the previous extension.

2. If the incoming message is a TEN command result:

   `ten_runtime` changes the `status_code` of the result to error, adds the missing `required` fields, and sets the values of these fields to their default values based on their type.

3. If the incoming message is a TEN data-like message:

   `ten_runtime` simply drops the data-like message.

## Behavior of graph check

TEN Manager has a function called Graph Check, which is used to verify the semantic correctness of a graph. The checks related to required fields are as follows:

1. For a connection, the `required` fields of the source must be a superset of the `required` fields of the destination.
2. If the same field name appears in both the source and destination `required` fields, their types must be compatible.
