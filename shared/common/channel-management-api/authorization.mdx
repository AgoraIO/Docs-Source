The `Content-Type` field in all HTTP request headers is `application/json`. All requests and responses are in JSON format. All request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.

The Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs only support HTTPS. Before sending HTTP requests, you must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the **Customer ID** and **Customer Secret** provided by Agora, and pass the credential to the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [RESTful authentication](/video-calling/reference/restful-authentication) for details.
