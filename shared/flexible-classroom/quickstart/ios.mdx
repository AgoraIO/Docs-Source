## Get the source code

The source code of Flexible Classroom (iOS) is in the [CloudClass-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS) and [apaas-extapp-ios](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/apaas-extapp-ios) repositories. To download the source code to your local device, refer to the following steps:

1. To clone the CloudClass-iOS repository to your local computer, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS.git
   ```

2. To navigate into the CloudClass-iOS directory and switch to a specified version, run the following commands. Replace `{VERSION}` with the version number that you want:

   ```bash
   cd CloudClass-iOS
   ```

   ```bash
   git checkout release/`{VERSION}`
   ```

   For example, if you want to switch to the branch of v2.6.1, just run the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/2.6.1
   ```

   Agora recommends switching the branch of the latest release. The following image shows how to see the latest release branch in the GitHub repository:
