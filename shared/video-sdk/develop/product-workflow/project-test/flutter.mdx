3. In `/lib/main.dart`, update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values from <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

4. Connect a test device to your development device.

5. In your IDE, click **Run app** or execute `flutter run` in a terminal window. A moment later, you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run your app, grant camera and microphone permissions.

6. Select a user role. Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.

7. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your test device as you move the slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap the **Mute** `CheckBox` while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app. You notice that the remote audio is muted on your test device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `onVolumeChanged` replace the `agoraEngine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(volume);` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid:_remoteUid!, volume:volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `onMuteChecked` replace the `agoraEngine.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams` call with one of the following:

        ```java
        agoraEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(uid: _remoteUid!, mute: _isMuted);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(_isMuted);
        ```
        Run the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.

6. **Test Screen sharing**

    1. Press **Start Screen Sharing**. 
    
        * On Windows and macOS, you see one of the open windows displayed in the local video container and in the web demo app.

        * On iOS and Android, you see the entire screen displayed in the local video container and in the web demo app.

    1. Press **Stop Screen Sharing**. Screen sharing stops and the camera video and audio streams are restored.
