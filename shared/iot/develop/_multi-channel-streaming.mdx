Some special use-cases require live streaming over two or more separate channels. For example, consider the case of a real-time monitoring system, where camera feed is shared over two channels for two types of users. There are also certain applications where you want to send multiple streams over the same channel. Consider the case of a monitoring system where feeds from multiple cameras are shared on the same channel.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK" /> multi-streaming allows you to join multiple channels at the same time or send multiple streams over a single channel. This page shows you how to implement two different multi-streaming methods into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="SDK" />. Choose the method that best fits your particular use-case.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="COMPANY" />  <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides the following approaches to implementing multi-streaming:


* **Push multiple streams to a single channel**

    To push multiple streams to a single channel, you create multiple connections using <Vg k="COMPANY" /> engine. You call the join channel method multiple times with the same channel name but different connection Ids and distinct user Ids to set up multiple streams. To send audio or video data, you use the connection Id of the intended stream.

* **Stream to multiple channels**

    To stream over multiple channels, you create multiple connections using <Vg k="COMPANY" /> engine. To join each channel, you use a distinct channel name and a dedicated connection Id. You use the connection Id to specify the intended channel when sending audio or video data, when leaving a particular channel, or when closing a connection.

The following figure shows the workflow you need to implement to add multi-streaming to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have implemented the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link> for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to implement <Vg k="COMPANY" /> multi-streaming feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Vpd k="NAME"/> [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project you created previously.
