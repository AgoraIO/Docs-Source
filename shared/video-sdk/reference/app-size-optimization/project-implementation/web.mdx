## Reduce the app size

To reduce the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> size, implement the following strategies:

### Use tree shaking

In versions before v4.19.0, the `AgoraRTC` module is the entrance to all callable methods in the Web <Vg k="VSDK" />. Even if you only use a part of the <Vg k="VSDK" />'s functionality, you still need to load the complete SDK, which may result in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> containing a lot of unused code.

Starting from version 4.19.0, the <Vg k="VSDK" /> for Web has integrated [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) support. Using tree shaking has the following advantages:

- Only load the SDK features you actually use, unreferenced code is removed during the build process.
- Reduce redundancy between SDK dependencies and your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> dependencies.

Starting from version 4.22.0, in addition to the core modules, the SDK also provides multiple independent service modules for optional use, such as media stream relay and media push, to meet the needs of different business scenarios.

To use tree shaking, import all used methods, enumerations, constants, types, and so on by adding `/esm` at the end of the package name `agora-rtc-sdk-ng`:

```javascript
// Example of correct reference citation method
import { createClient } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference enum
import { ConnectionDisconnectedReason } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference constant
import { VERSION } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
// Reference type
import type { ICameraVideoTrack } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
```

Starting from version 4.22.0, you can integrate different functional modules as needed in the following ways:

- Media stream relay

    ```javascript
    // Import core modules
    import { AgoraRTC } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
    // Import the media stream relay module
    import { ChannelMediaRelayService } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/services/channel-media-relay";

    AgoraRTC.use(ChannelMediaRelayService);
    ```

- Media push

    ```javascript
    // Import core modules
    import { AgoraRTC } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/esm";
    // Import the media push module
    import { LiveStreamingService } from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng/services/live-streaming";

    AgoraRTC.use(LiveStreamingService);
    ```
