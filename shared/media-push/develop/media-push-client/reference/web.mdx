- A maximum of 17 hosts can be supported in the same live-broadcast channel.
- Set the value of `videoBitrate` according to the [Video Bitrate Table](video_profile_web_ng#recommended-video-profiles). If you set a bitrate beyond the recommended range, the SDK automatically adjusts it to a value within the range.
- To prevent logic errors, Agora suggests using different URLs for Media Push with transcoding and Media Push without transcoding.
- In the case of a single host, Agora does not recommend transcoding. You can skip Step 1, and call `Client.startLiveStreaming` directly with `enableTranscoding` set as `false`. Please use `AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: "live", codec: "h264"})` in this case.
