To integrate  <Vg k="VSDK" /> on React Native 0.60.0 or later:

1. Navigate to the root folder of your project in the terminal and integrate with either:
    - npm

        ```bash
        npm i --save react-native-agora
        ```

    - yarn

        ```bash
        // Install yarn.
        npm install -g yarn
        // Download the Agora React Native SDK using yarn.
        yarn add react-native-agora
        ```

        Do not link native modules manually, React Native 0.60.0 and later support [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/main/docs/autolinking.md).

1. If your target platform is iOS, use CocoaPods to install <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

    ```bash
    npx pod-install
    ```

1. <Vg k="VSDK" /> uses Swift in native modules, your project must support compiling Swift. To create `File.swift`:

    1. In Xcode, open `ios/ProjectName.xcworkspace`.
    1. Click **File > New > File, select iOS > Swift File**, then click **Next > Create** .


See [SDKs](../../sdks) for the latest React Native downloads.
