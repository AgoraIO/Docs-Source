Agora Real-Time Speech-To-Text (STT) enables you to transcribe the voice stream of each host to provide live closed captions (CC) and transcription for improved accessibility. Its advanced features, remove silent audio segments to optimize transcription performance and reduce costs. The output text can be translated to multiple languages and further processed as input for large language models, such as GPT. Real-Time STT serves as a gateway for real-time engagement to enter the AI arena.
