### Package the extension

After encapsulating the filter into an extension, you need to register and package it into a `.framework` or `.xcframework` file, and submit it together with a file that contains the extension name, vendor name and filter name to Agora.


Register the extension with the macro `REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER`, which is in the `AgoraExtensionProviderEntry.h` file.

Use this macro at the entrance of the extension implementation. When the SDK loads the extension, this macro automatically registers it to the SDK. For example:

```objc
REGISTER_AGORA_EXTENSION_PROVIDER(ByteDance, agora::extension::ExtensionProvider);
```
