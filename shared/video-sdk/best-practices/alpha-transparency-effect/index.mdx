In various real-time video interaction use-cases, segmenting the host's background and applying transparent special effects can make the interaction more engaging, enhance immersion, and improve the overall interactive experience.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, windows, unity, react-native">
Consider the following sample use-cases:

* **Broadcaster background replacement**: The audience sees the broadcaster's background in the video replaced with a virtual scene, such as a gaming environment, a conference, or a tourist attractions.

* **Animated virtual gifts**: Display dynamic animations with a transparent background to avoid obscuring live content when multiple video streams are merged.

* **Chroma keying during live game streaming**: The audience sees the broadcaster's image cropped and positioned within the local game screen, making it appear as though the broadcaster is part of the game.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

## Implement alpha transparency

<Implementation />

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-native, unity">
### Development notes

- Implement the transparency properties of the app window yourself and handle the transparency relationship when multiple windows are stacked on top of each other (achieved by adjusting the `zOrder` of the window). 
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="android">
- On Android, only `TextureView` and `SurfaceView` are supported when setting the view due to system limitations.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios, macos">
- For iOS, set `opaque` to `false` in the view's `layer` property when setting up the view.
- For macOS, You don't need to additionally set the transparency properties of the window. Follow the settings described for iOS.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="windows">
- For Windows, create a separate window using `CreateWindowEx` when creating the project and set the `High Transparency` property. If the target window is a child window, you need to additionally specify the `WS_POPUP` property.
</PlatformWrapper>
