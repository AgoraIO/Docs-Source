When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> that is geographically closest to the user. However, to meet the laws and regulations of the user's country, you may need to specify, or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

After you turn on the restricted access area feature, the SDK only accesses the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server in the specified area, irrespective of the geographical location of the user. As an example, the following table shows the outcome if you specify North America as the access region, and users connect to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> from North America and China respectively:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Designated access area</th>
      <th>User's region</th>
      <th>Area actually accessed by the SDK</th>
      <th>User experience</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">North America</td>
      <td>North America</td>
      <td rowspan="2">North America</td>
      <td>Normal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>China</td>
      <td>Quality may be affected</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Admonition title="information" type="info"> 
* If a server in the specified area is not available, the SDK reports an error.
* Due to cross-regional public Internet between the designated area and the area where the app user is located, the audio and video experience may be affected.

The following figure shows the workflow you implement to restrict area access:

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

## Implement restricted area access
This section shows you how to restrict area access in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
