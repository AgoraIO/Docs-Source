### Manage basic chat room attributes

#### Retrieve basic chat room attributes

All the chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer` to retrieve the detailed information of the current chat room, including the subject, announcement, description, member type, and admin list.

```typescript
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer to retrieve the basic attributes of the chat room.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer(roomId)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```

#### Change the chat room name or description

Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the chat room name and description.

```typescript
// The chat room owner and admin call changeChatRoomSubject to change the chat room name.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.changeChatRoomSubject(roomId, subject)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });

// The chat room owner and admin call changeChatroomDescription to modify the chat room description.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.changeChatRoomDescription(roomId, desc)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```

#### Retrieve or change the chat room announcement

All chat room members can retrieve the chat room announcement.

Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the announcement. Once the announcement is updated, all the other chat room members receive the `onAnnouncementChanged` callback.

```typescript
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomAnnouncement to retrieve the chat room announcement.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(roomId)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });

// The chat room owner and admin can call updateChatRoomAnnouncement to set or update the chat room announcement.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.updateChatRoomAnnouncement(roomId, announcement)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```

### Manage custom chat room attributes

#### Set one or more custom attributes

All chat room members can call `addAttributes` to set one or more custom attribute. Use this method to add new custom attributes or update existing attributes that are set by yourself and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `onAttributesUpdated` callback.

```typescript
// Sets custom attribute by specifying the chat room ID and the key-value maps of the attributes.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.addAttributes({
    roomId,
    attributes,
    deleteWhenLeft,
    overwrite,
  })
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```

#### Retrieve specified or all custom attributes

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomAttributes` to retrieve the specified or all custom attributes of the chat room.

```typescript
// Retrieves certain custom attributes by specifying chat room ID and attribute keys.
// Retrieves all custom attributes if you pass an empty key.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomAttributes(roomId, keys)
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```

#### Remove one or more custom attributes

All chat room members can call `removeAttributes` to remove one or more custom attributes that are set by themselves and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `onAttributesRemoved` callback.

```typescript
// Removes custom attributes by specifying the chat room ID and the attribute key list.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.removeAttributes({
    roomId,
    keys,
    forced,
  })
  .then((response) => {
    rollLog(`success: ${response}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    rollLog(`fail: ${error}`);
  });
```
