### Disable `3A`

<Vg k="VSDK" /> turns on `3A` by default. `3A` stands for echo cancellation (AEC), noise reduction (ANS), and gain control (AGC) in audio processing. Sound card devices usually provide some built-in audio processing, such as echo and noise cancellation. Currently, if `3A` is enabled in the application layer, it may cause over-processing of the audio signal, and interference between different algorithms may impact sound quality. Therefore, it is recommended that users using sound cards call [`createMicrophoneAudioTrack`](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/web/4.x/interfaces/iagorartc.html#createmicrophoneaudiotrack) to disable the `3A` function enabled by default.

```javascript
AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack({
    AEC: false,  // Turn off echo cancellation
    AGC: false,  // Turn off gain control
    ANS: false,  // Turn off noise reduction
}).then(/**...**/);
```
