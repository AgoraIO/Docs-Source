* Installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Project setup
To set up and run your <Vg k="FC" /> project, you need the following tools: 

* `Node.js` JavaScript runtime environment for building and running the web project.
* `yarn`: A package manager.
* `nvm`: (Optional) Version management command-line tool for `Node.js`.

### Install the development tools

To prepare your development environment:

1. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Git.

1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en) and install Node.js. It is recommended to use Node.js 16. Node.js 18 and above versions are not supported yet.

1. Install Yarn:

   - If you have `Node.js` `16.10` or later, you can directly enable `yarn` with the following command:

      ```bash
      corepack enable
      ```

   - If you have a version of `Node.js` earlier than 16.10, you need to install `corepack` first and then enable `yarn` with the following command:

      ```bash
      npm i -g corepack enable
      ```

1. (Optional) To install `nvm`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
   ```

1. (Optional) When Electron installation fails, you can install it by setting the Electron mirror address:

    ```bash
    export ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
    export ELECTRON_CUSTOM_DIR=v12.0.0
    export ELECTRON_CUSTOMDIR=v12.0.0
    ```

### Download the source code


  To set up your <Vg k="FC" /> project:


1. Clone the repository locally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop.git
   ```

1. After the download is complete, navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd flexible-classroom-desktop
   ```

1. Best practice is to switch to the latest release.

    To switch to the branch for version `2.9.0`, run the command:

    ```bash
    git checkout release/2.9.0
    ```

## Implement a Flexible Classroom

Follow these steps to launch a <Vg k="FC" />:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `Flexible-Classroom-Desktop` folder. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install:packages
   ```

   If the installation dependency times out, switch to an available mirror source:

   ```bash
   # Switch to a mirror
   yarn config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/
   # Install dependencies
   yarn install:packages
   ```

1. Copy the App ID and App Certificate from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and update the corresponding parameters in the `.env` file:

   ```javascript
   REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID={your appid}
   REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE={your app certificate}
   ```

   To facilitate your testing, the `Flexible-Classroom-Desktop` project contains a <Vg k="MESS" /> Token generator, which can generate a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> Token with the App ID and App Certificate you provide. When your project goes live, you must deploy a <Vg k="MESS" /> Token generator on your server to ensure security.

1. Run the following command to launch the web client in different development modes:

   ```bash
   # Start Flexible Classroom Demo debugging
   yarn dev
   # Start AgoraEduSDK debugging
   yarn dev:classroom
   # Start Proctor SDK debugging
   yarn dev:proctor
   # Start FcrUIScene debugging
   yarn dev:scene
   ```

   If you use Node.js 17, you may encounter the `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error. This is because Node.js 17 has switched to OpenSSL 3.0 and conflicts with the encryption algorithm or key being used in some dependencies in the project. You can try the following two solutions:

   - Add `NODE_OPTION` parameters `--openssl-legacy-provider`

   ```bash
   # Find the Node.js configuration file packages/agora-demo-app/package.json
   # To modify the startup command under the script field, add the NODE_OPTION parameter, for example:
   # Original command
   "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=6144 FCR_ENTRY=demo webpack serve --config ./webpack.dev.js"
   # Change to
   "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max_old_space_size=6144 --openssl-legacy-provider\" FCR_ENTRY=demo webpack serve --config ./webpack.dev.js"
   # Then start the project
   yarn dev
   ```

   - Use nvm to downgrade the Node.js version to 16

   ```bash
   # Use nvm to manage Node.js versions
   # Install nvm
   yarn global add nvm
   # Install Node.js version 16 using nvm
   nvm install 16
   # Use Node.js version 16
   nvm use 16
   # Start Flexible Classroom
   yarn dev
   ```

## Test your implementation

1. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You see the login page of <Vg k="FC" />. 

1. To join a classroom, type in a room name and user name. Select a class type, set the user role to `Teacher` and then press **Enter**. 

   You are logged in to <Vg k="FC" />.

1. Install <Vg k="FC" /> on a second device. Login with the same credentials but this time set the user role to `Student`.

1. The `Teacher` and `Student` can now interact and communicate using <Vg k="FC" /> features.
