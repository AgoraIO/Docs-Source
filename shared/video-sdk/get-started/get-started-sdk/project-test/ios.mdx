Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Connect your iOS device to your computer.

1. Click **Build** to run your project and wait a few seconds for the App installation to complete.

1. Allow the app to access the device's microphone and camera permissions.

1. If an untrusted developer prompt pops up on the device, click **Cancel** to close the prompt, then open **Settings > General > VPN and Device Management** on the iOS device, and choose to trust the developer in the **Developer APP**.

1. On a second iOS device, repeat the previous steps, install the app on the device, open the app, join the same channel, and observe the test results:
    * If both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If two devices join as host and audience respectively, the host can see themselves in the local video window; the audience can see the host in the remote video window and hear the host.
