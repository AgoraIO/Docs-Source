Metadata provides easy-to-use, serverless storage for user and channel data enabling you to build innovative, reliable, and scalable applications. Metadata support, built into the <Vpd k="SDK" />, enables you to create <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that are personalized, user-friendly, and secure. Use this feature to easily store data without the need to set up your own databases. <Vpd k="SDK" /> also triggers events when metadata is updated. Clients can receive these events in real-time and update their front-end accordingly.

You can leverage user and channel metadata in <Vpd k="NAME" /> apps to:

* **Personalize user profiles**: Create user profiles that include additional information such as the user's full name, a profile picture URL, geographic location, and availability status. 

* **Maintain chat history**: Store and display chat history, including timestamps and message status such as whether a message has been read or not. 

* **Maintain search history**: Enable users to quickly search for specific messages, users, or topics within the app. 

* **Customize notifications**: Enable users to customize their notification settings, such as choosing notifications to receive and setting custom alert tones. 

* **Enhance security**: Enforce security measures, such as verifying user identity and encrypting messages. 

## Understand the tech

This section presents an overview of the steps required to integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> metadata features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the basic workflow you implement to read and write user and channel metadata:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequisites />

## Implement storage

In this example, after a user logs in to <Vpd k="NAME" />, you clear any previous data and set fresh metadata for the local user in the form of key-value pairs. When a local user changes a value stored as metadata, you call the update method to save the new value. You show a list of all users currently in the channel. When a local user selects another user from the list, you retrieve and display their metadata. You subscribe to the metadata change event of remote users to be notified of updates.
