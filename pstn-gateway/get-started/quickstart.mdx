Agora's <Vpd k="NAME" /> enables seamless integration between traditional telephony systems and Agora real-time communication channels. This service allows users to join Agora channels via phone calls, whether through inbound dialing with PIN authentication or outbound calls initiated by your application.

## Prerequisites

Before using the <Vpd k="NAME" /> APIs:

- **Create an account and project**. Refer to [Agora account management](../get-started/manage-agora-account) for details.
- **Contact Agora to provision your App ID** with the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service. [Contact support](mailto:support@agora.io) to request access and provisioning.
- **Obtain an authorization header** to include in your API requests. Agora support will provide this during the provisioning process. 

## Understand the tech

<Vpd k="NAME" /> provides multiple methods to connect phone calls to Agora channels. Choose the integration approach that best fits your use case:

| Integration Type | Description | Best For |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Inbound PSTN** | Users dial a phone number and enter a PIN to join your Agora channel. This is the most common integration pattern. | Conferences, webinars, customer support hotlines |
| **Outbound PSTN** | Your application initiates calls to users' phone numbers to connect them to an Agora channel. | Notifications, alerts, automated customer outreach |
| **Inbound SIP** | Generate SIP addresses to route calls from traditional telephony systems to Agora channels. | Enterprise PBX integration, existing SIP infrastructure |

## Implement inbound PSTN

This section guides you through implementing inbound PSTN, where users dial in to join a channel. Follow these steps:

1. Request a phone number and PIN

    Call the [inbound PSTN REST API](../rest-api/inbound-pstn).

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`curl -X POST https://sipcm.agora.io/v1/api/pstn \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: use-your-api-key-here" \
    -d '{
        "action": "inbound",
        "appId": "your-agora-app-id",
        "uid": "user123",
        "channel": "conference-room",
        "region": "AREA_CODE_NA"
    }'`}
    </CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    <CodeBlock language="python">
    {`import requests

   url = "https://sipcm.agora.io/v1/api/pstn"
   headers = {
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
       "Authorization": "use-your-api-key-here"
   }

   data = {
       "action": "inbound",
       "appId": "your-agora-app-id",
       "uid": "user123",
       "channel": "conference-room",
       "region": "AREA_CODE_NA"
   }

   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
   result = response.json()

   print(f"Phone number: {result['display']}")
   print(f"PIN: {result['pin']}")`}
    </CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

    <CodeBlock language="javascript">
    {`const axios = require('axios');

   const response = await axios.post('https://sipcm.agora.io/v1/api/pstn', {
   action: 'inbound',
   appId: 'your-agora-app-id',
   uid: 'user123',
   channel: 'conference-room',
   region: 'AREA_CODE_NA'
   }, {
   headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': 'use-your-api-key-here'
   }
   });

   console.log(\`Phone number: \${response.data.display}\`);
   console.log(\`PIN: \${response.data.pin}\`);`}
    </CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Share the details with your user

    The API returns a phone number and PIN that you provide to your user:

    ```json
    {
     "did": "12345678901",
     "display": "+1 (234) 567-8901",
     "pin": "987654"
    }
    ```

3. User joins the call

    1. User dials the phone number: `+1 (234) 567-8901`
    2. System prompts for the PIN
    3. User enters: `987654`
    4. User is connected to the `conference-room` channel

## Reference

For additional functionality and complete parameter descriptions, refer to the REST API documentation.

- **Core call management**

    - **[Inbound PSTN](../rest-api/inbound-pstn)** - Generate a phone number and PIN for users to dial in and join an Agora channel
    - **[Outbound PSTN](../rest-api/outbound-pstn)** - Initiate outbound calls to connect users directly to an Agora channel
    - **[Inbound SIP](../rest-api/inbound-sip)** - Request a SIP address for routing calls to an Agora channel via SIP protocol

- **Call control**

    - **[End call](../rest-api/end-call)** - Terminate an active outbound call using the call ID
    - **[Cancel call](../rest-api/cancel-call)** - Cancel a previous inbound call setup request

- **Advanced features**

    - **[Static PIN](../rest-api/static-pin)** - Configure an external endpoint to validate static, non-expiring PINs for PSTN access
