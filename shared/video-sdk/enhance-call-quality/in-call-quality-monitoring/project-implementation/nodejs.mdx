In `IRtcEngineEventHandler`, implement the following real-time interaction quality statistics callbacks and audio or video state monitoring callbacks to understand user interaction experience:

- `onNetworkQuality`: Reports uplink and downlink last mile network quality.
- `onRtcStats`: Reports real-time interaction statistics.
- `onLocalAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the sent audio stream.
- `onLocalAudioStateChanged`: Reports local audio stream state changes.
- `onRemoteAudioStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote audio stream.
- `onRemoteAudioStateChanged`: Reports remote audio stream state changes.
- `onLocalVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the sent video stream.
- `onLocalVideoStateChanged`: Reports local video stream state changes.
- `onRemoteVideoStats`: Reports statistics for the received remote video stream.
- `onRemoteVideoStateChanged`: Reports remote video stream state changes.

In your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>, add the following code:

```javascript
const EventHandler = {
  // Report real-time interactive statistical information
  onRtcStats: (connection, state) => {
    console.log(`connection:${connection}, state:${state}`);
  },

  // Report statistics on the audio streams sent
  onLocalAudioStats: (connection, state) => {
    console.log(`connection:${connection}, state:${state}`);
  },

  // Report local audio stream status monitoring
  onLocalAudioStateChanged: (connection, state, error) => {
    console.log(`connection:${connection}, state:${state}, error:${error}`);
  },

  // Report statistics on received far-end audio streams
  onRemoteAudioStats: (connection, state) => {
    console.log(`connection:${connection}, state:${state}`);
  },
  // Report remote audio stream status monitoring
  onRemoteAudioStateChanged: (
    connection,
    remoteUid,
    state,
    reason,
    elapsed
  ) => {
    console.log(
      `connection:${connection},remoteUid:${remoteUid}, state:${state}, reason:${reason}, elapsed:${elapsed}`
    );
  },

  // Report statistics on video streams sent
  onLocalVideoStats: (source, stats) => {
    console.log(`source:${source}, stats:${stats}`);
  },
  // Report local video stream status monitoring
  onLocalVideoStateChanged: (source, state, error) => {
    console.log(`source:${source}, state:${state}, error:${error}`);
  },

  // Report statistics on received remote video streams
  onRemoteVideoStats: (connection, stats) => {
    console.log(`connection:${connection}, stats:${stats}`);
  },
  // Report remote video stream status monitoring
  onRemoteVideoStateChanged: (
    connection,
    remoteUid,
    state,
    reason,
    elapsed
  ) => {
    console.log(
      `connection:${connection},remoteUid:${remoteUid}, state:${state}, reason:${reason}, elapsed:${elapsed}`
    );
  },
};
// Register event callbacks
let rtcEngine = createAgoraRtcEngine();
rtcEngine.registerEventHandler(EventHandler);
```
