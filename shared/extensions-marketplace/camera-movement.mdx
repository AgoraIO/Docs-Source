| Up and Down Rhythm     | Provides more freedom and flexibility for camera movements through different rhythmic modes, presenting diverse perspectives and offering a wider interactive space.                                        |
| Left and Right Rhythm  | Provides more freedom and flexibility for camera movements through different rhythmic modes, presenting diverse perspectives and offering a wider interactive space.                                        |
