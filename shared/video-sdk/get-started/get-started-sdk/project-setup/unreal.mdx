### Create a user interface

In order to experience live video streaming intuitively, a user interface (UI) needs to be created based on the application scenario.

If you want to implement a live video broadcast, it is recommended to add the following controls to the UI:

Local anchor video window
Remote anchor video window
Join/leave channel button
Refer to the following steps to create the UI. If you already have a user interface in your project, you can skip this step.

Create Widget Blueprint

In Unreal Editor , click Content Drawer > Content , right-click and select User Interface > Widget Blueprint . Name the created Widget Blueprint AgoraWidget and double-click AgoraWidget to enter the blueprint.


Create local and remote host view windows in Widget Blueprint

Create a view canvas. Select Palette > PANEL > Canvas Panel and drag it to the AgoraWidget .


Create a local view window. Select COMMON > Image , drag it to the Canvas Panel , rename it LocalVideo , and adjust its position in the canvas. An example of the settings is as follows:

Position X：350
Position Y : 150
sizeX：450
Size Y : 450
Repeat the above steps to create a remote view window, name it RemoteVideo , and adjust its position in the canvas. An example of the settings is as follows:

Position X：1200
Position Y : 150
sizeX：450
Size Y : 450
Create join and leave channel buttons in Widget Blueprint
