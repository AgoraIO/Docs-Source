3. In **Unity Editor**, in `Assets/Agora-Unity-RTC-SDK/Code/JoinChannelAudio.cs`, update `_appID`, `_channelName` and `_token` with the values for your temporary token.

4. Connect a test device to your development device.

5. In **Unity Editor**, click **Play**. A moment later you see the application running on your device.
If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

6. Click **Join** to start a call. Now, you can see yourself on the device screen and talk to the remote user using your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

7. In your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, in `Assets/Agora-RTC-Plugin/Agora-Unity-RTC-SDK/Code/JoinChannelAudio.cs`,
replace
``` csharp
RtcEngineContext context = new RtcEngineContext(_appID, 0, true,
CHANNEL_PROFILE_TYPE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING,
AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT, AREA_CODE.AREA_CODE_NA);
```
with
``` csharp
RtcEngineContext context = new RtcEngineContext(_appID, 0, true,
CHANNEL_PROFILE_TYPE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING,
AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT, AREA_CODE.AREA_CODE_JP);

Now, you can hear yourself and remote user on the device. It means your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has made a connection with the specified region <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.
