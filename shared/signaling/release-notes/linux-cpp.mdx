### v2.2.1

v2.2.1 was released on July 26, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release optimizes the implementation of certain features, which involves renaming, deleting, or modifying the behavior of some APIs. To ensure the proper functioning of your project, you need to modify your implementation after upgrading the SDK.

1. Initialization

This release removes the `initialize` method, and add the initialization parameter to the [`createAgoraRtmClient`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#createAgoraRtmClient) method as replacements. Refer to the sample code below to modify your implementation:

```cpp
// Earlier than v2.2.1
// Create an Signaling instance
IRtmClient* rtmClient = createAgoraRtmClient();

RtmConfig config;
config.appId = "your_appid";
config.userId = "your_name";
config.eventHandler = new RtmEventHandler();
// Initialize the Signaling instance
int ret = rtmClient->initialize(config);
if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
    // Handle initialization error
}
```
```cpp
// v2.2.1 or later
RtmConfig config;
config.appId = "your_appid";
config.userId = "your_name";
config.eventHandler = new RtmEventHandler();
int errorCode = 0;
// Create and initialize the Signaling instance
rtmClient = createAgoraRtmClient(config, errorCode);
if (!rtmClient || errorCode != 0) {
    std::cout << RED <<"error creating rtm service!" << std::endl;
    exit(0);
}
```

1. API return values

This release adds  the return values of all methods, except for `createAgoraRtmClient`, `createStreamChannel`, and `release`, have been changed from `int` to `void`. Additionally, this release adds the following asynchronous callbacks:

- [`onPublishTopicMessageResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-topic/topic#asynchronouscallback2)
- [`onUnsubscribeTopicResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-topic/topic#asynchronouscallback5)
- [`onGetSubscribedUserListResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-topic/topic#asynchronouscallback6)
- [`onUnsubscribeResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#asynchronouscallback2)
- [`onLogoutResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#asynchronouscallback5)
- [`onRenewTokenResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-token/token#asynchronouscallback1)
- [`onUnsubscribeUserMetadataResult`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-storage/storage#asynchronouscallback10)

1. Metadata

This release removes the `createMetadata` method. Refer to the sample code below to modify your implementation:

```cpp
// Earlier than v2.2.1
IMetadata* metadata = rtmClient->getStorage()->createMetadata();
```

```cpp
// v2.2.1 or later
Metadata data;
```

1. Enumerator changes

This release adds the the <code>{enumv.reasoncertification[props.ag_platform]}(22)</code> in the [<code>{enumv.connectionreason[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/enumv#connectionreason). The values of the <code>{enumv.reasonstreamchannel[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{enumv.reasoninconsistentappid[props.ag_platform]}</code> also changes to 23 and 24, respectively.

#### New features

1. Private deployment capability

This release adds the `privateConfig` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration) to set private deployment. See [Private configuration](../user-guide/setup/private-setup).

1. Heartbeat interval configuration

This release adds the `heartbeatInterval` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration) to set the interval at which the SDK sends heartbeat packets to the server. See [Heartbeat interval and presence timeout](../user-guide/link/link-basic#heartbeatinterval-and-presencetimeout).

1. Dual environment configuration

This release adds the `protocolType` parameter in [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration) to set the network transport protocol. See [Protocol configuration](../user-guide/setup/application-setup#protocol).

1. User channel

This release adds the <code>{enumv.channeltypeuser[props.ag_platform]}</code> type in [<code>{enumv.channeltype[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/enumv#channeltype) for sending messages to specific users. This feature can replace the point-to-point messaging feature in v1. See [Sending messages in user channel](../user-guide/message/send-message#userchannel).

1. Quiet mode configuration

This release adds the `beQuiet` property in [<code>{channel.subscribeoptions[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#subscribe) and [<code>{channel.joinchanneloptions[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#join) to enable quiet mode when subscribing or joining a channel. Once you enable the quiet mode, other users in the channel cannot receive your presence event notifications.

#### Improvements

1. Connection state management

This release deprecates the <code>{config.onconnection[props.ag_platform]}</code> callback and adds the [<code>{config.onlinkstateevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#event-listening) callback instead. See [Connection management](../user-guide/link/link-basic).

1. RTM_PRESENCE_EVENT_TYPE_REMOTE_STATE_CHANGED event notification logic

This release changes the triggering logic of the `RTM_PRESENCE_EVENT_TYPE_REMOTE_STATE_CHANGED` event. When a user sets or modifies multiple key-value pairs at once, other users in the channel receive only one event notification.

1. Support for event notification timestamps

This release adds a new `timestamp` parameter in the following data structures to report the timestamp of the triggered event notification:

- [<code>{config.messageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#messageevent)
- [<code>{config.presenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#presenceevent)
- [<code>{config.topicevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#topicevent)
- [<code>{config.storageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#storageevent)
- [<code>{config.lockevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#lockevent)

1. Optimized API behavior

This release improves the behavior of the following APIs:
- [<code>{config.login[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#login)
  - Earlier than v2.2.1: the SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method, or passing an empty string in the `token` parameter.
  - v2.2.1 or later: the SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method without the need for additional calls to <code>{config.logout[props.ag_platform]}</code> in between. Additionally, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK uses the App ID you provided during initialization as a replacement for the token.
- [<code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#subscribe)
  - Earlier than v2.2.1: the SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method.
  - v2.2.1 or later: the SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method.
- [<code>{channel.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#join)
  - Earlier than v2.2.1: the SDK does not support multiple consecutive calls to this method, or passing an empty string in the `token` parameter.
  - v2.2.1 or later: the SDK supports multiple consecutive calls to this method. Additionally, when the `token` parameter is an empty string, the SDK uses the App ID you provided during initialization as a replacement for the token.

1. Range of presenceTimeout

This release changes the range of the `presenceTimeout` parameter in the [<code>{config.rtm[props.ag_platform]}</code>](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration) from [10, 300] to [5, 300].

1. Others

This release also includes the following improvements:

- Enhances underlying algorithm capability to improve data synchronization speed.
- Adds the `requestId` parameter to the following methods:
  - [`login`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#login)
  - [`logout`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-configuration/configuration#logout)
  - [`renewToken`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-token/token)
  - [`unsubscribe`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#unsubscribe)
- Adds the `errorCode` parameter to the [`createStreamChannel`](/api-ref/rtm2/cpp/toc-channel/channel#createStreamChannel) method.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the issue that remote users occasionally did not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypeleave[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification when the local user directly called the <code>{config.logout[props.ag_platform]}</code> method without calling the <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> method.

### v2.1.12

v2.1.12 was released on July 2, 2024.

#### Improvements

This release includes the following improvements:

- For data synchronization errors caused by network issues, this release introduces a user logout mechanism, which ensures that the SDK automatically logs out of the Signaling system.
- Unsubscribing from a message channel during network disconnection will no longer return an error.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- During a disconnection with the Signaling system under poor network conditions, the user experienced errors when unsubscribing from a message channel.
- Under poor network conditions, the user occasionally failed to receive callbacks after a successful login.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the user occasionally could not receive the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- After reconnecting from a disconnection, the SDK occasionally failed to restore subscription relationships in the stream channel.
- Occasional failure to receive topic messages from web clients.

### v2.1.11

v2.1.11 was released on May 13, 2024.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the response mechanism when subscribing to or joining channels with the `withPresence=true` setting. If the user does not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypesnap[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification within 5 seconds, the SDK will report the <code>{code.presencenotready[props.ag_platform]}</code> error code in the <code>{config.onjoinresult[props.ag_platform]}</code> callback.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- In specific scenarios, after logging out of the Signaling system and logging back in, occasional failures occurred when subscribing to or joining channels with the `withPresence=true` setting.
- In cases where the connection was lost due to network issues and then restored, if the local user actively called the <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to leave the channel, a remote user occasionally did not receive the <code>{enumv.presencetypetimeout[props.ag_platform]}</code> type of the <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification.
- Occasional failures occurred when frequently calling the <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{channel.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> methods.

### v2.1.10

v2.1.10 was released on March 11, 2024.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sending messages frequently, message sending occasionally timed out.
- After calling `renewToken` to renew the token, some services were not functioning correctly, resulting in unexpected disconnection.

### v2.1.9

v2.1.9 was released on February 22, 2024.

This is the first release of the Signaling SDK for C++ v2.x, which brings innovation in functional coverage, performance improvement, and experience optimization.

- Functional coverage: v2.x covers more business scenarios by introducing functional modules such as channels, messages, topics, presence, storage, and locks. This enables you to focus more on your own business innovation.
- Performance improvement: v2.x implements a restructured technical architecture and enhances performance through optimized network connections. Our long-term real-time network access capabilities ensure high service quality characterized by low latency, high reliability, extensive concurrency, and robust extensibility.
- Experience optimization: v2.x redesigns and simplifies the API interface. We have additionally enriched our documentation, including user guides and API references, with extensive sample code to provide you with comprehensive developer resources. These improvements significantly reduce the effort required to understand and integrate the SDK, ultimately enhancing development efficiency.

#### New features

v2.1.9 provides the following core functional modules:

1. **Initial configuration**

    - <code>{config.create[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Create an instance of the Signaling client.
    - <code>{config.init[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Perform the initial configuration as follows:
      - `appId`: Set the App ID to enable communication between apps with the same ID while isolating apps with different IDs.
      - `userId`: Set the user ID to distinguish users or devices.
      - `areaCode`: Set the area code for the geofencing feature.
      - `presenceTimeout`: Set the presence timeout.
      - `context`：
        - For Android, it is the context of Android Activity.
        - For Windows, it is the window handle of the app. Once set, this parameter enables you to connect or disconnect the video devices while they are powered.
      - `useStringUserId`: Set the data type of the user ID, which can be of type `string` or type `uint`.
      - `eventHandler`: Set event listeners.
      - `logConfig`: Configure the log file size, log file path, and output level.
      - `proxyConfig`: Configure whether to enable proxy.
      - `encryptionConfig`: Configure whether to enable encryption.
    - Event handling: Implement event notification for the events such as <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>, <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>, <code>{config.ontopicevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>, <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> , <code>{config.onlockevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>, `onConnectionStateChange`, and <code>{config.ontokenwillexpire[props.ag_platform]}</code>.
    - <code>{config.login[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Log into the RTM service.
    - <code>{config.logout[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Log out of the RTM service.
    - <code>{config.release[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Destroy the Signaling client.

1. **Channel**

    In the Signaling real-time network, channels serve as a mechanism for managing data transmission. When a user subscribes to or joins a channel, they can receive messages and events transmitted within the channel with a latency of up to 100 milliseconds. Signaling enables clients to subscribe to hundreds or even thousands of channels. Most Signaling APIs perform operations such as sending, receiving, and encrypting data on a channel basis.

    Signaling includes two types of channels, message channel and stream channel, each offering distinct core capabilities as follows:

    - Message channel:
      - <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Subscribe to the specified message channel and receive messages and event notifications in the channel.
      - <code>{channel.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Unsubscribe from the specified message channel and stop receiving messages and event notifications in the channel.
    - Stream channel:
      - <code>{channel.create[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Create a stream channel instance and then call relevant APIs.
      - <code>{channel.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Join the stream channel and receive messages and event notifications in the channel.
      - <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Leave the stream channel and stop receiving messages and event notifications in the channel.
      - <code>{channel.release[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Destroy the stream channel.

    By calling different methods, the SDK triggers different event notifications.

    - The <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>, <code>{channel.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>, <code>{channel.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>, and <code>{channel.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code> methods trigger the <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. Other users in the channel receive the corresponding <code>{enumv.presencetypejoin[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{enumv.presencetypeleave[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notifications.
    - When calling <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> and <code>{channel.join[props.ag_platform]}</code> to subscribe or join a channel, you can choose whether to configure` withMessage`, `withPresence`, `withMetadata`, `withLock`, and other parameters to enable or disable the monitoring of the corresponding event. To enable the monitoring, you also need to register the corresponding event listener to receive corresponding event notifications.

1. **Message**

    The basis of Signaling is the ability to send messages. You can send messages to channels anytime, anywhere, and the messages are delivered within 100 milliseconds. Signaling supports message payloads of both `string` and `byte` type.

    Call <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> to send a message to the specified message channel. Calling <code>{message.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code> triggers the <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. If you want to receive messages in the channel, set `withMessage` to `true` when calling <code>{channel.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code> and register the event handler for the <code>{config.onmessageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event.

1. **Topic**

    In stream channels, topics serve as a data flow management mechanism. This feature allows you to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events related to data streams within stream channels. By leveraging topics effectively, you can significantly reduce business complexity and enhance development efficiency. The main functions of topics are as follows:

    - <code>{topic.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Register as the publisher of this topic to gain the ability to send messages.
    - <code>{topic.publish[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Send a message to the topic in the stream channel.
    - <code>{topic.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Unregister as the message publisher of this topic.
    - <code>{topic.subscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Subscribe to one or more message publishers of the topic in this channel.
    - <code>{topic.unsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Unsubscribe from this topic or unsubscribe from one or more message publishers in this topic.
    - <code>{topic.getsubscribe[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Get the list of subscribed publishers in a specific topic.

    Register (<code>{topic.join[props.ag_platform]}</code>) and unregister (<code>{topic.leave[props.ag_platform]}</code>) as a message publisher trigger the <code>{config.ontopicevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification that is sent to other users in the channel.

    <Admonition type="caution" title="caution">Topics exist only in stream channels, not in message channels.</Admonition>

1. **Presence**

    Presence provides the ability to monitor the online status and temporary status changes of users. With presence, you can obtain real-time information as follows:

    - Real-time event notification when a user joins or leaves a specified channel.
    - Real-time event notification when the custom temporary user state changes.
    - Query which channels a specified user has joined or subscribed to.
    - Query which users have joined a specified channel and their temporary user state data.

    The following features can be used in both message channels and stream channels:

    - `getOnlineUsers`: Get real-time information about the number of online users, the list of online users, and their temporary status in a specified channel.
    - `getUserChannels`: Get real-time information about the list of channels which a specific user joins.
    - <code>{presence.setstate[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Set the temporary status of a user in a specified channel.
    - <code>{presence.getstate[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Get the temporary status of a user in a specified channel.
    - <code>{presence.removestate[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Remove the temporary status of a user in a specific channel.

    In addition, presence also provides event notification capabilities through the <code>{config.onpresenceevent[props.ag_platform]}</code>. Events such as users joining, leaving, going offline, setting user state, and removing user state are sent as notifications to other users in the channel in real time (Announce Mode) or at regular intervals (Interval Mode). Presence greatly simplifies the implementation of the synchronization logic related to user online and offline status and state changes. This feature helps make your business more stable, real-time, and reliable.

1. **Storage**

    The storage feature provides a dynamic database mechanism that allows developers to dynamically set, store, update, and delete channel metadata and user metadata. It also listens to the events generated by changes of channel metadata or user metadata. After calling the <code>{storage.createmetadata[props.ag_platform]}</code> method to create <code>{storage.metadata[props.ag_platform]}</code>, you can perform operations on channel metadata and user metadata based on your specific needs.

    - **Channel metadata**

        - <code>{storage.setchannel[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Set the channel metadata or channel metadata item for a specified channel.
        - <code>{storage.getchannel[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Get the channel metadata and channel metadata item for a specified channel.
        - <code>{storage.removechannel[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Remove the channel metadata or channel metadata item for a specified channel.
        - <code>{storage.updatechannel[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Update the existing channel metadata or channel metadata item for a specified channel.

        Setting, deleting, and updating channel metadata trigger the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. This feature can greatly optimize your business logic and provide an excellent user experience. Currently, the event notification <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> carries the complete information of the current channel metadata. It will be optimized in future versions to provide incremental update capabilities.

        Channel metadata also introduces the ability to control locks. When calling APIs to set, delete, or update channel metadata, if the `lockName` parameter is set, lock verification is enabled. In this case, only the owners of the lock can call the corresponding methods successfully.

    - **User Metadata**

        - <code>{storage.setuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Set the user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.
        - <code>{storage.getuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Get the user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.
        - <code>{storage.removeuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Remove the user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.
        - <code>{storage.updateuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Update the existing user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.
        - <code>{storage.subscribeuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Subscribe to event notifications for changes in user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.
        - <code>{storage.unsubscribeuser[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Unsubscribe from event notifications for changes in user metadata or a user metadata item for a specified user.

        Setting, deleting, and updating user metadata trigger the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. Other users subscribed to this user metadata receive the event notifications. This feature can greatly optimize your business logic and provide an excellent user experience. Currently, the <code>{config.onstorageevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification carries the complete information of the current user metadata. It will be optimized in future versions to provide incremental update capabilities.

    - **Compare And Set (CAS) control**

        Both channel metadata and user metadata introduce the CAS version control logic, which provides two independent version control fields that you can use according to your business scenario:
        - Enable version number verification for the entire set of channel metadata by setting the `revision` property through the `setMajorRevision` method in the <code>{storage.metadata[props.ag_platform]}</code> data type.
        - Enable version number verification for a single metadata item by setting the `revision` property in the <code>{storage.metadataitem[props.ag_platform]}</code> class.


        When setting, deleting, or updating channel metadata or user metadata, you can control whether to enable revision verification by using the `revision` property. The logic is as follows:

        - If `revision` is set to `-1`, the CAS validation is not enabled for this call. If the metadata or metadata item already exists, it is overwritten by the latest value. If the metadata or metadata item does not exist, a new metadata or metadata item is created.
        - If `revision` is set as a positive `Uint64` integer, the CAS validation is enabled for this call. If the metadata or metadata item already exists, the value is updated after successful version number validation. If the metadata or metadata item does not exist, the SDK returns an error code.

1. **Lock**

    A critical resource can only be used by one process at a time. If different processes share a critical resource, they need to adopt a mutually exclusive approach to prevent interference. RTM offers a comprehensive set of lock solutions and process control in distributed systems, enabling you to effectively manage competition among users accessing shared resources. Lock provides the following capabilities:

    - <code>{lock.set[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Set a lock for a specified channel.
    - <code>{lock.acquire[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Acquire a specified lock in a specified channel.
    - <code>{lock.release[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Release a specified lock in a specified channel.
    - <code>{lock.revoke[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Revoke the ownership of a specific user for a lock in a specified channel to release the lock.
    - <code>{lock.get[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Get the details of all locks in a specified channel.
    - <code>{lock.remove[props.ag_platform]}</code>: Remove a specified lock in a specified channel.

    The lock setting, acquisition, release, revocation, and deletion operations trigger the corresponding <code>{config.onlockevent[props.ag_platform]}</code> event notification. You can make full use of this feature to optimize the implementation logic of your business.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the handling logic for expired user status data during reconnection.
