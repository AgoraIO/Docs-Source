        Press **Zoom In**. You see that the local video captured by your device camera is cropped and scaled to give a zoom-in effect. The processed video is displayed both locally and remotely. Pressing the button again stops processing of raw video data and restores the original video.

        Edit the `iAudioFrameObserver` definition by adding code that processes the raw audio data you receive in the following callbacks:

        -   `onRecordAudioFrame`: Gets the captured audio frame data

        -   `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: Gets the audio frame for playback

        -   `onMixedAudioFrame`: Retrieves the mixed captured frame for playback audio frame
