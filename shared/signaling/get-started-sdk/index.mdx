You use <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You can also use <Vg k="SIG" /> to
enhance the user experience for <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" />.

This page shows you how to easily integrate pub-sub messaging into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />. For information about stream channels where users communicate using topics in a channel, see [Stream channel quickstart](/en/signaling/get-started/stream-channel).

## Understand the tech

Pub-sub is the simplest form of messaging. <Vg k="SIG" /> creates a channel when a user subscribes to it. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> listens for events which contain messages users publish to a channel.

You use an authentication token to authenticate a user with <Vg k="SIG" /> and join a channel. Each token is bound to a single user UID. This means that only one concurrent user may login from an instance of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

To create a pub-sub session for <Vg k="SIG" />, implement the following steps in your
<Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from a [Token Generator](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/). To understand how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Implement <Vg k="SIG" />

Best practice is to separate the <Vg k="SIG" /> workflows from your UI implementation. The <Vpd k="SDK" /> sample project implements the <Vg k="SIG" /> business logic in the `SignalingManager` class. This class encapsulates the <Vg k="SIG" /> engine instance and core functionality such as logging in to <Vg k="MESS"/>, sending a message, listening for messages from other users and logging out.

The following code examples show how to implement these steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

## Test <Vg k="SIG" />

This section explains how to run the reference app and see the corresponding features in an <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

### Token expiration  

After a token expires, you call the logout method to log out of <Vg k="SIG" />, then use the new Token to create an `RTM` instance, and then call the login method to log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> again.
