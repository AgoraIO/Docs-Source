When the connection status changes, <Vpd k="SDK" /> triggers the `OnConnectionStateChanged` callback. This section describes how to use the `OnConnectionStateChanged` callback to monitor changes in a channel's connection state.

Use the following code in your `IRtcEngineEventHandler` to log the connection state changes and the reason for the state change.

```csharp
internal class UserEventHandler : IRtcEngineEventHandler
{
    ...
    // Callback for channel connection status change
    public override void OnConnectionStateChanged(RtcConnection connection, CONNECTION_STATE_TYPE state,
        CONNECTION_CHANGED_REASON_TYPE reason)
    {
        _helloVideoTokenAgora._state = state;
    }
}
```

The `state` parameter in `OnConnectionStateChanged` reports the current connection state. The `reason` parameter indicates why the connection state changed to help you troubleshoot your network. See [State description and troubleshooting](#state-description-and-troubleshooting).
