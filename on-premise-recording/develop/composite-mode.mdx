  How to record audio and video in composite recording mode using command line. 
---

## Overview

The On-Premise Recording SDK supports two recording modes:

- Individual recording mode: This is the default recording mode. The SDK generates one audio and/or video file for each UID. 
- Composite recording mode: Generates a single mixed audio and video file for all UIDs in a channel, or mixes the audio of all UIDs in the channel into an audio file and the video of all UIDs into a video file.

This page shows how to record audio and/or video in **composite recording mode** by the command line.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have compiled the Agora Recorder Demo and know how to record a call by the command line. For more information, see [Record by Command Line](../get-started/record-cmd). You must select either individual recording mode or composite recording mode when you start the recording. You cannot switch between the two modes after a recording starts. 

See [Differences between individual recording mode and composite recording mode](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/recording_mode) to decide which mode you should use.

> For simplicity, we assume that every UID in the channel sends both audio and video streams. If a UID neither sends audio nor video, such as the audience in interactive streaming, there will be no file for this UID.

## Implementation

### Enable composite recording mode

When starting recording, set the `isMixingEnabled` parameter as 1 to enable composite recording mode. 

The recording files and formats depend on your choice of recording audio, video, or both.

|                              | Setting                                   | Recording files and formats                      |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Record only audio            | `--isAudioOnly 1`<p> `--isMixingEnabled 1`</p>     | One audio file in AAC format                     |
| Record only video (no audio) | `--isVideoOnly 1` <p>`--isMixingEnabled 1`</p>     | One video file in MP4 format                     |
| Record both audio and video  | `--isMixingEnabled 1` <p>`--mixedVideoAudio 2`</p> | One file in MP4 format with both audio and video |

> - In composite recording mode, if you choose to record both audio and video, we suggest setting the  `mixedVideoAudio` parameter as 2 to mix the audio and video in an MP4 file in real time.
> - In composite recording mode, if you choose to record only audio/video, do not set the  `mixedVideoAudio` parameter as 2. 

### Set audio/video profile

In composite recording mode, you can set the audio and video profile of the recording file.

#### Audio profile

You can set the `audioProfile` parameter as the following values:

- `0`: (Default) Sample rate of 48 kHz, communication encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 48 Kbps.
- `1`: Sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 128 Kbps.
- `2`: Sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, stereo, and a bitrate of up to 192 Kbps.

#### Video profile

You can set the `mixResolution` parameter, including the width, height, frame rate, and bitrate. The default setting is `360,640,15,500.` We recommend you set the video profile according to the [Video Profile Table](../reference/video-profile#video-profile-table).

### Set video layout

In composite recording mode, you can use the `layoutMode` parameter to set the video layout and arrange the size and position of the region for each user. The default value is 0 (Floating Layout). For more information, see [Set Video Layout](../develop/layout).

## Example

The following example shows how to record both audio and video in a channel in composite recording mode.

```
./recorder_local --appId <Your App ID> --channel <The name of the channel to be recorded> --channelProfile 1 --uid 0 --appliteDir ~/Agora_Recording_SDK_for_Linux_FULL/bin --isMixingEnabled 1 --mixedVideoAudio 2 --audioProfile 1 --mixResolution 640,480,15,1000 --layoutMode 1
```

## Considerations

If a user stops sending streams or leave the channel during a recording session, the recording service fills the region of that user with the color of the canvas.
