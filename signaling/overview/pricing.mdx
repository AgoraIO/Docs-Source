### Costing examples

**Example 1 - Fixed package**: Suppose your number of peak concurrent users is less than 2500, monthly message volume is less than 150M, and storage use is less than 10GB. Based on the Pro package, the monthly billing will be $399.

**Example 2 - Pay-as-you-go (Enterprise Package)**: Suppose your number of peak concurrent users is 20K, monthly message volume is 800M, and storage use is 10GB. The monthly billing will be as follows:

* PCU: 20K  
  PCU cost = 20000/1000 x $15 = $300 ($15 for every thousand peak concurrent users)
* Message count: 800M  
  Message cost = 800 x $1.5 = $1,200 ($1.5 for every million messages)
* Storage: 10GB  
  Storage cost = 10 x $7.5 = $75 ($7.5 for every GB of storage)
* **Total cost**: $300 + $1,200 + $75 = $1,575 (PCU + Messages + Storage)
