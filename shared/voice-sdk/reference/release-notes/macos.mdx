### v4.3.0

v4.3.0 was released on January xx, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release has optimized the implementation of some functions, involving renaming or deletion of some APIs. To ensure the normal operation of the project, you need to update the code in the app after upgrading to this release.

1. **Renaming parameters in callbacks**

   In order to make the parameters in some callbacks and the naming of enumerations in enumeration classes easier to understand, the following modifications have been made in this release. Please modify the parameter settings in the callbacks after upgrading to this release.

   | Callback                           | Original parameter name        | Existing parameter name |
   | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
   | `localAudioStateChanged`           | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `localVideoStateChanged`           | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `onDirectCdnStreamingStateChanged` | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `didChangedToState`                | `error`                        | `reason`                |
   | `rtmpStreamingChangedToState`      | `errCode`                      | `reason`                |

   | Original enumeration class      | Current enumeration class       |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | `AgoraAudioLocalError`              | `AgoraAudioLocalReason`              |
   | `AgoraLocalVideoStreamError`        | `AgoraLocalVideoStreamReason`        |
   | `AgoraDirectCdnStreamingError`      | `AgoraDirectCdnStreamingReason`      |
   | `AgoraMediaPlayerError`             | `AgoraMediaPlayerReason`             |
   | `AgoraRtmpStreamingError`           | `AgoraRtmpStreamingReason`           |

   **Note:** For specific renaming of enumerations, please refer to [API changes](#apichange).

2. **Channel media relay**

   To improve interface usability, this release removes some methods and callbacks for channel media relay. Use the alternative options listed in the table below:

   | Deleted methods and callbacks | Alternative methods and callbacks  |
   | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelay`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelay`</li></ul>| `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`   |
   | <ul><li>`startChannelMediaRelayEx`</li><li>`updateChannelMediaRelayEx`</li></ul>| `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` |
   | `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent`| `channelMediaRelayStateDidChange`  |

3. **Custom video source**

   Since this release, `pushExternalVideoFrame`[1/2] is migrated from `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` to `AgoraRtcEngineKit`.

4. **Audio route**

   Starting with this release, `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetooth` in [AgoraAudioOutputRouting](API/enum_audioroute.html) is renamed to `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetoothDeviceHfp`, representing a Bluetooth device using the HFP protocol. `AgoraAudioOutputRoutingBluetoothDeviceA2dp`(10) is added to represent the audio route to a Bluetooth device using the A2DP protocol.

5. **Reasons for local video state changes**

   This release makes the following modifications to the enumerations in the [AgoraLocalVideoStreamReason](API/enum_localvideostreamreason.html) class:

   - The `AgoraLocalVideoStreamErrorEncodeFailure` enumeration has been changed to `AgoraLocalVideoStreamReasonCodecNotSupport`.

#### New features

1. **Custom mixed video layout on the receiving end**

   To facilitate customized layout of mixed video stream at the receiver end, this release introduces the [didTranscodedStreamLayoutInfoUpdatedWithUserId](API/callback_irtcengineeventhandler_ontranscodedstreamlayoutinfo.html) callback. When the receiver receives the channel's mixed video stream sent by the video mixing server, this callback is triggered, reporting the layout information of the mixed video stream and the layout information of each sub-video stream in the mixed stream. The receiver can set a separate `view` for rendering the sub-video stream (distinguished by `subviewUid`) in the mixed video stream when calling the [setupRemoteVideo](API/api_irtcengine_setupremotevideo.html) method, achieving a custom video layout effect.

   When the layout of the sub-video streams in the mixed video stream changes, this callback will also be triggered to report the latest layout information in real time.

   Through this feature, the receiver end can flexibly adjust the local view layout. When applied in a multi-person video scenario, the receiving end only needs to receive and decode a mixed video stream, which can effectively reduce the CPU usage and network bandwidth when decoding multiple video streams on the receiving end.

2. **Local preview with multiple views**

   This release supports local preview with simultaneous display of multiple frames, where the videos shown in the frames are positioned at different observation positions along the video link. Examples of usage are as follows:

   1. Call [setupLocalVideo](API/api_irtcengine_setuplocalvideo.html) to set the first view: Set the `position` parameter to `AgoraVideoModulePositionPostCaptureOrigin` (introduced in this release) in `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`. This corresponds to the position after local video capture and before preprocessing. The video observed here does not have preprocessing effects.
   2. Call [setupLocalVideo](API/api_irtcengine_setuplocalvideo.html) to set the second view: Set the `position` parameter to `AgoraVideoModulePositionPostCapture` in `AgoraRtcVideoCanvas`, the video observed here has the effect of video preprocessing.
   3. Observe the local preview effect: The first view is the original video of a real person; the second view is the virtual portrait after video preprocessing (including image enhancement, virtual background, and local preview of watermarks) effects.

3. **Query Device Score**

   This release adds the [queryDeviceScore](API/api_irtcengine_querydevicescore.html) method to query the device's score level to ensure that the user-set parameters do not exceed the device's capabilities. For example, in HD or UHD video scenarios, you can first call this method to query the device's score. If the returned score is low (for example, below 60), you need to lower the video resolution to avoid affecting the video experience. The minimum device score required for different business scenarios is varied. For specific score recommendations, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

4. **Select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming**

   This release introduces the [selectMultiAudioTrack](API/api_imediaplayer_selectmultiaudiotrack.html) method that allows you to select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming to remote users. For example, in scenarios like online karaoke, the host can choose to play the original sound locally and publish the accompaniment in the channel. Before using this function, you need to open the media file through the [openWithMediaSource](API/api_imediaplayer_openwithmediasource.html) method and enable this function by setting the `enableMultiAudioTrack` parameter in [AgoraMediaSource](API/class_mediasource.html).

5. **Device test for audio capturing and playback**

   This release introduces the following methods to test whether the audio capturing or playback devices work properly before joining a channel:

   - [startRecordingDeviceTest](API/api_iaudiodevicemanager_startrecordingdevicetest.html): Tests whether the local audio capturing device, such as the speaker, is working properly. After calling this method, the SDK triggers a callback at the time interval set in this method, which reports uid = 0 and the volume information of the capturing device. After the test is completed, you need to call the newly added [stopRecordingDeviceTest](API/api_iaudiodevicemanager_stoprecordingdevicetest.html) method to stop the test.
   - [startPlaybackDeviceTest](API/api_iaudiodevicemanager_startplaybackdevicetest.html): Tests whether the local audio playback device is working properly. You can specify the audio file to be played through the `testAudioFilePath` parameter and see if your audio device works properly. After the test is completed, you need to call the newly added [stopPlaybackDeviceTest](API/api_iaudiodevicemanager_stopplaybackdevicetest.html) method to stop the test.

6. **Others**

   This release has passed the test verification of the following APIs and can be applied to the entire series of RTC 4.x SDK.

   - [setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption](API/api_irtcengine_setremotesubscribefallbackoption.html): Sets fallback option for the subscribed video stream in weak network conditions.
   - [didRemoteSubscribeFallbackToAudioOnly](API/callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onremotesubscribefallbacktoaudioonly.html): Occurs when the subscribed video stream falls back to audio-only stream due to weak network conditions or switches back to the video stream after the network conditions improve.
   - [setPlayerOption [1/2\]](API/api_imediaplayer_setplayeroption.html) and [setPlayerOption [2/2\]](API/api_imediaplayer_setplayeroption2.html): Sets media player options for providing technical previews or special customization features.
   - [enableCustomAudioLocalPlayback](API/api_irtcengine_enablecustomaudiolocalplayback.html): Sets whether to enable the local playback of external audio source.

#### Improvements

1. **SDK task processing scheduling optimization**

   This release optimizes the scheduling mechanism for internal tasks within the SDK, with improvements in the following aspects:

   - The speed of video rendering and audio playback for both remote and local first frames improves by 10% to 20%.
   - The API call duration and response time are reduced by 5% to 50%.
   - The SDK's parallel processing capability significantly improves, delivering higher video quality (720P, 24 fps) even on lower-end devices. Additionally, image processing remains more stable in scenarios involving high resolutions and frame rates.
   - The stability of the SDK is further enhanced, leading to a noticeable decrease in the crash rate across various specific scenarios.

2. **In-ear monitoring volume boost**

   This release provides users with more flexible in-ear monitoring audio adjustment options, supporting the ability to set the in-ear monitoring volume to four times the original volume by calling [setInEarMonitoringVolume](API/api_irtcengine_setinearmonitoringvolume.html).

3. **Dual-stream mode optimization**

   This release optimizes the video dual-stream mode. In the low-quality video stream adaptive mode (`AgoraAutoSimulcastStream`), when the receiver requests a low-quality video stream by calling [setRemoteVideoStream](API/api_irtcengine_setremotevideostreamtype.html) or [setRemoteVideoStreamEx](API/api_irtcengineex_setremotevideostreamtypeex.html), the sender now processes requests from all users, expanding beyond the previous restriction to broadcasters only. This change ensures that the audience requests for low-quality video streams are implemented, thus improving the flexibility and adaptability of the dual-stream mode.

4. **Spatial audio effects usability improvement**

   - This release optimizes the design of the [setZones](API/api_ibasespatialaudioengine_setzones.html) method, supporting the ability to set the `zones` parameter to `NULL`, indicating the clearing of all echo cancellation zones.
   - As of this release, it is no longer necessary to unsubscribe from the audio streams of all remote users within the channel before calling methods in [AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit](API/class_ilocalspatialaudioengine.html).
   - This release introduces the [updateSelfTransform](API/api_ilocalspatialaudioengine_updateselftransform.html) method, designed to pass position vectors for direct rendering in iOS native frameworks such as SceneKit or RealityKit.

5. **Local audio state changed callback optimization**

   This release introduces the following enumerations in [AgoraAudioLocalReason](API/enum_localaudiostreamreason.html), enabling users to obtain more details about local audio errors through the [localAudioStateChanged](API/callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onlocalaudiostatechanged.html) callback:

   - `AgoraAudioLocalReasonInterrupted`: The local audio capture is interrupted by system calls, Siri, or alarm clocks. Remind your users to end the phone call, Siri, or alarm clock if the local audio capture is required.

6. **Optimization of video pre-processing methods**

   This release adds overloaded methods with the `souceType` parameter for the following 5 video preprocessing methods, which support specifying the media source type for applying video preprocessing effects by passing in `sourceType` (for example, applying on a custom video capture media source):

   - [setBeautyEffectOptions [2/2\]](API/api_irtcengine_setbeautyeffectoptions2.html)
   - [setLowlightEnhanceOptions [2/2\]](API/api_irtcengine_setlowlightenhanceoptions2.html)
   - [setVideoDenoiserOptions [2/2\]](API/api_irtcengine_setvideodenoiseroptions2.html)
   - [setColorEnhanceOptions [2/2\]](API/api_irtcengine_setcolorenhanceoptions2.html)
   - [enableVirtualBackground [2/2\]](API/api_irtcengine_enablevirtualbackground2.html)

7. **Other Improvements**

   This release also includes the following improvements:

   - This release optimizes the SDK's domain name resolution strategy, improving the stability of calling to resolve domain names in complex network environments.
   - When passing in an image with transparent background as the virtual background image, the transparent background can be filled with customized color.
   - This release adds the `earMonitorDelay` and `aecEstimatedDelay` members in [AgoraRtcLocalAudioStats](API/class_localaudiostats.html) to report ear monitor delay and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) delay, respectively.
   - The [cacheStats](API/callback_imediaplayersourceobserver_onplayercachestats.html) callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being cached. This callback is triggered once per second after file caching is started.
   - The [playbackStats](API/callback_imediaplayersourceobserver_onplayerplaybackstats.html) callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being played. This callback is triggered once per second after the media file starts playing. You can obtain information like the audio and video bitrate of the media file through [AgoraMediaPlayerPlaybackStats](API/class_playerplaybackstats.html).

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sharing two screen sharing video streams simultaneously, the reported `captureFrameRate` in the [localVideoStats](API/callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onlocalvideostats.html) callback is 0, which is not as expected.

### v4.2.6

v4.2.6 was released on November 17, 2023.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issue:

- When using an iOS 16 or later device with Bluetooth headphones connected before joining the channel, the audio routing after joining the channel was not as expected: Audio was played from the speaker, not the Bluetooth headphones.

### v4.2.3

v4.2.3 was released on October 11, 2023.

#### Improvements

**Other Improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Optimizes the logic of handling invalid parameters. When you call the `setPlaybackSpeed` method to set the playback speed of audio files, if you pass an invalid parameter, the SDK returns the error code -2, which means that you need to reset the parameter.
- Optimizes the logic of Token parsing, in order to prevent an app from crash when an invalid token is passed in.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes when joining a channel.
- Occasional failure of joining a channel when the local system time was not set correctly.
- When calling the `playEffect [3/3]` method to play two audio files using the same `soundId`, the first audio file was sometimes played repeatedly.

### v4.2.2

v4.2.2 was released on july 27, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user id. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can avoid repeated application of tokens every time users joining a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

   <div class="alert note">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</div>

2. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannelByToken[1/2]` and `preloadChannelByToken[2/2]` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shortening the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to avoid repeated application of tokens every time you joining a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Secure authentication with tokens](/en/video-calling/get-started/authentication-workflow).

#### Improvements

1. **Virtual Background Algorithm Upgrade**

   This version has upgraded the portrait segmentation algorithm of the virtual background, which comprehensively improves the accuracy of portrait segmentation, the smoothness of the portrait edge with the virtual background, and the fit of the edge when the person moves. In addition, it optimizes the precision of the person's edge in scenarios such as meetings, offices, homes, and under backlight or weak light conditions.

2. **Channel media relay**

   The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, noise occurred when the local user listened to their own and remote audio after joining the channel.
- Slow channel reconnection after the connection was interrupted due to network reasons.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `preloadChannelByToken [1/2]`
- `preloadChannelByToken [2/2]`
- `updatePreloadChannelToken`



### v4.2.1

This version was released on June 21, 2023.

#### Improvements

This version improves the network transmission strategy, enhancing the smoothness of audio interactions.

#### Fixed Issues

This version fixed the following issues:

- Inability to join channels caused by SDK's incompatibility with some older versions of AccessToken.
- After the sending end called `setAINSMode` to activate AI noise reduction, occasional echo was observed by the receiving end.
- Brief noise occurred while playing media files using the media player.

### v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May 24, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**2. Virtual sound card**

As of v4.2.0, Agora supports third-party virtual sound cards. You can use a third-party virtual sound card as the audio input or output device for the SDK. You can use the `stateChanged` callback to see whether the current input or output device selected by the SDK is a virtual sound card.

<div class="alert note">If you set AgoraALD or Soundflower as the default input or output device when joining a channel, you will not hear audio.</div>

**3. Miscellaneous**

- `didApiCallExecute` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**1. AI Noise Suppression**

This release introduces public APIs for the AI Noise Suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise suppression mode as balance, aggressive, or low latency according to your scenarios.

<div class="alert note">Agora charges separately for this function. See [AI Noise Suppression unit pricing](pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).</div>

**2. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `getNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.

#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**3. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host frequently switched the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members could not hear the audio of the host.
- Incorrect information in the `type` field of the return value after calling `getDefaultAudioDevice`.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `getNtpWallTimeInMs`
- `setAINSMode`

### v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on February 8, 2023.

#### New features

**Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio frames, which can speed up the first audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the issue that playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.

#### API changes

**Added**

`enableInstantMediaRendering`

### v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December 15, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call setHeadphoneEQParameters to adjust the EQ.

**2. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

> To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:sales-us@agora.io">sales-us@agora.io</a>.

**3. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` method is used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio stream, respectively.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` is used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio streams, respectively.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `leaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `leaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**4. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `didClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelLowLatency` (1): Low latency.
- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelUltraLowLatency` (2): Ultra-low latency.

#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventUpdateDestinationChannelRefused`(8), and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### **Issues fixed**

This release fixed the following issues:

- After starting and stopping the audio capture device test, there was no sound when the audio playback device was subsequently started.
- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.

### v4.0.1

v4.0.1 was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

To improve code usability, this release changes the parameters in optional type in the following classes to basic data types such as ` bool` and `int`:

- `isAgoraSource` and `isLiveSource` in `AgoraMediaSource` is changed from optional to bool.
- All parameter types in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` are changed from `optional` to `bool` or `int`.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

After successfully enabling the in-ear monitoring function, you can call `setAudioFrameDelegate` to register the audio observer, and the SDK triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback to report the audio frame data. You can use your own audio effect processing module to pre-process the audio frame data of the in-ear monitoring to implement custom audio effects. Agora recommends that you choose one of the following two methods to set the audio data format of the in-ear monitoring:

- Call the `setEarMonitoringAudioFrameParametersWithSampleRate` method to set the audio data format of in-ear monitoring. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the parameters in this method, and triggers the `onEarMonitoringAudioFrame` callback based on the sampling interval.
- Set the audio data format in the return value of the `getEarMonitoringAudioParams` callback. The SDK calculates the sampling interval based on the return value of the callback, and triggers the onEarMonitoringAudioFrame callback based on the sampling interval.

To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call `setInEarMonitoringVolume`.

**2. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the `getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use, including UNKNOWN, DISCONNECTED, LAN, WIFI, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `networkTypeChangedToType` callback to report the current network connection type.

 **3. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports 3 audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; you can contact support@agora.io to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Meanwhile, Agora supports publishers to choose whether or not the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered will bypass this filter mechanism and transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios where there are a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reducing the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

To enable this function, contact support@agora.io.

**4. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense of presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listner experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user, respectively, by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation paramter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`, and the receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the hearing of the headphones.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `getEarMonitoringAudioParams`

- `getNetworkType`
- `isAudioFilterable` in the `ChannelMediaOptions`
- `setZones`
- `setPlayerAttenuation`
- `setRemoteAudioAttenuation`
- `muteRemoteAudioStream`
- `SpatialAudioParams`
- `setHeadphoneEQPreset`
- `AgoraHeadphoneEQPreset`

**Deprecated**

- `startEchoTest` [2/3]

### v4.0.0

v4.0.0 was released on September 15, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**1. Integration change**

This release has optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v3.7.x. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Custom video capture and rendering (Media IO)
- Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see [Migrate from v3.7.x to v4.0.0](./develop/migration-guide).

#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `AgoraRtcEngineKit` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` and `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`.

- After calling `joinChannelByToken` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelExByToken` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` settings.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**3. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayerWithDelegate` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `AgoraRtcMediaPlayerProtocol` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

**4. Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (in comparison to the basic AI noise reduction in v3.7.x). The new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option. To experience this feature, contact sales-us@agora.io.

**5. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `AgoraVoiceBeautifierUltraHighQuality` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**6. Spatial audio**

This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact sales-us@agora.io. Contact [Technical Support](mailto:support@agora.io) if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of the remote user.
  ![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/video-call-spatial.png)




You can also set the spatial audio for the media player as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation: This solution uses the `AgoraLocalSpatialAudioKit` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.
  ![Spatial effect](/images/video-sdk/spatial-audio-effect.png)



**7. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AgoraAudioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AgoraAudioScenario`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.

**8. Extensions from the Agora extensions marketplace**

In order to enhance the real-time audio and video interactive activities based on the Agora SDK, this release supports the one-stop solution for the extensions from the <Link to="{{GLOBAL.APP_ID_LINK}}/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/">Agora extensions marketplace</Link>:

- Easy to integrate: The integration of modular functions can be achieved simply by calling an API, and the integration efficiency is improved by nearly 95%.
- Extensibility design: The modular and extensible SDK design style endows the Agora SDK with good extensibility, which enables developers to quickly build real-time interactive apps based on the Agora extensions marketplace ecosystem.
- Build an ecosystem: A community of real-time audio and video apps has developed that can accommodate a wide range of developers, offering a variety of extension combinations. After integrating the extensions, developers can build richer real-time interactive functions. For details, see [Use an Extension](../develop/use-an-extension).
- Become a vendor: Vendors can integrate their products with Agora SDK in the form of extensions, display and publish them in the Agora extensions marketplace, and build a real-time interactive ecosystem for developers together with Agora. For details on how to develop and publish extensions, see [Become a Vendor](../get-started/get-started-sdk).

**9. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannelByToken` or `joinChannelExByToken` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelWithMediaOptions` to update the settings in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio sources.

**11. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blocklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)` interface:

- `setSubscribeAudioBlacklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeAudioWhitelist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and a allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

**12. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `setAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AgoraAudioScenarioDefault` to `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannelByToken` in v3.7.x through the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannelByToken` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `switchChannelByToken` method.

**2. Voice pitch of the local user**
This release adds `voicePitch` in `AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo` of `reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.
