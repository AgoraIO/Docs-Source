<PlatformWrapper platform="flutter">
In a Flutter project, you integrate the native Android and iOS plug-ins through Gradle and CocoaPods respectively. 

1. **Integrate the Android plugin through Gradle**

    1. Unzip the downloaded Android package and save all `.aar` files to the `android/libs` folder.

    1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following line under `dependencies`:
        
        ```groovy
        implementation fileTree(dir: "${rootProject.projectDir}/libs", include: ["*.aar"])
        ```

1. **Integrate the iOS plugin through CocoaPods**

    1. Unzip the downloaded iOS package and import all `.framework` files into the project.
    1. Add dependencies to the `<project-root>/*.podspec` file as follows:

        ```
        Pod::Spec.new do |s|
        s.name             = 'Extensions'
        s.version          = '0.1.0'
        s.summary          = 'ByteDance effect plugin for声网 RTE extensions.'
        s.description      = 'project.description'
        s.homepage         = 'https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/AgoraMarketPlace'
        s.author           = { 'Agora' => 'developer@agora.io' }
        s.source           = { :path => '.' }
        s.vendored_frameworks = 'libCNamaSDK.framework', 'AgoraFaceUnityExtension.framework'
        s.platform = :ios, '9.0'
        end
        ```

    1. Add the following lines to `Podfile` :
        
        ```
        pod 'Extensions', :path => "./"
        ```

1. **Add the `authpack` certificate**

    Convert the certificate file `authpack.java` or `authpack.h` in the plug-in package to dart syntax and save it to the Flutter `lib` folder. For conversion, see the following example:

    ```dart
    /// Paste your authpack data here, e.g.,
    /// List<int> gAuthPackage = [10, 13, -98, -100, 126, ...];
    List<int> gAuthPackage = [];
    ```

1. **Save the required model and `.bundle` files from the Resource package to the project folder as follows**

    For details of files provided in the resource pack, see [Resource package structure](#resource-package-structure).

1. **Add the necessary dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file**

    Make sure you reference all the required supporting libraries and assets as shown in the example below:

    ```yaml
    environment:
    sdk: '>=2.18.6 <3.0.0'

    dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter

    cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
    # Agora Flutter SDK dependencies, 
    # Please use the latest version of agora_rtc_engine
    agora_rtc_engine: ^6.1.0
    path_provider: ^2.0.11
    permission_handler: ^8.3.0
    path: ^1.8.0

    # The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
    flutter:

    # Resource file dependencies
    assets:
        - Resource/graphics/aitype.bundle
        - Resource/items/ItemSticker/CatSparks.bundle
        - Resource/model/ai_face_processor.bundle
    ```

1. **Import the dart libraries**

    Add the following to the list of import statements in `/lib/main.dart`:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:io';
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
    import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
    import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
    import 'authpack.dart' as authpack;
    ```
