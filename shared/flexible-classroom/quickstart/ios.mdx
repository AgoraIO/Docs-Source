## Launch a flexible classroom

Follow these steps to launch a flexible classroom:

1. Run the following command to clone the [CloudClass-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS) project and check out the latest release branch.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS.git
   ```

   ```
   git checkout release/apaas/x.y.z
   ```

    Replace x.y.z with the version number. To get the latest version number, see the [release notes](../reference/release-notes).

2. Run the following command to clone the [apaas-extapp-ios](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/apaas-extapp-ios) project and check out the latest release branch. Place the apaas-extapp-ios project under the same directory with CloudClass-iOS.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/apaas-extapp-ios.git
   ```

   ```
   git checkout release/apaas/x.y.z
   ```

2. In CloudClass-iOS, run `pod install`.

3. Open the CloudClass-iOS project in Xcode. Build and run the project.

   <div class="alert info">To facilitate your testing, the CloudClass-iOS project contains an RTM Token generator, which can generate a temporary RTM Token with a default App ID and App Certificate. If you want to use your own App ID and App Certificate, comment out the <code>requestToken</code> method in the <code>AgoraEducation/Main/Controllers/LoginViewController.swift</code> file and use the <code>buildToken</code> method instead. When your project goes live, to ensure security, you must deploy the RTM Token generator on your server.</div>

4. To join a classroom, pass in a room name and user name, select a room type, and click **Enter**.
