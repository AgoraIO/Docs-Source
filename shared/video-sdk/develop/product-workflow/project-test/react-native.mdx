6. Test volume control.

    1.  Speak into your development device as you press the **-** button a few times and then the **+** button a few times. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1.  Tap **Mute** while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app.
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your development device.

    1.  To test other volume control methods using the **+** and **-** buttons, in `App.tsx`, replace both occurences of `agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(volume);` with one of the following:

        ```ts
        agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUid,volume);
        agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngineRef.current?.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the buttons to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1.  To test other mute methods, replace the line `agoraEngineRef.current?.muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, isMuted);` with one of the following:

        ```ts
        agoraEngineRef.current?.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isMuted);
        agoraEngineRef.current?.muteLocalAudioStream(isMuted);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap **Mute** to test the effect of these mute methods.

7. Test screensharing.

    1. Press the **Screen Share** button. You see a prompt asking you to allow screen sharing, allow it.

        Your screen is visible below your own video.
    1. Press the **Screen Share** button again.

        Screen sharing is stopped.
