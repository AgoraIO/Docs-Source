### Set up an event listener

    Keep track of the users who join and leave topics, and events in the topic. In this implementation, we use the
  event listener in [signalingManager](/en/signaling/develop/get-started-sdk#handle-events).

### Join and leave a channel

    To create a new stream channel, call `createStreamChannel`. When you join the channel, you configure the features
    you will use. For example, [Presence](/en/signaling/reference/api#presence), [Storage](/en/signaling/reference/api#storage), and [Lock](/en/signaling/reference/api#lock). You use the [RTC authentication
    token](/en/signaling/get-started/authentication-workflow#authenticate-your--session) for the current UID to join the channel. To join a channel:

      ```javascript
        const streamChannelJoinAndLeave = async function (
          isStreamChannelJoined,
          uid,
          streamChannelName
        ) {
          const token = await fetchRTCToken(uid, streamChannelName);
          if (getSignalingStreamChannel() === null) {
            streamChannel = await signalingManager
              .getSignalingEngine()
              .createStreamChannel(streamChannelName); // creates stream channel
          }

          if (isStreamChannelJoined === false) {
            await streamChannel
              .join({
                token: token,
                withPresence: true,
              })
              .then((response) => {
                console.log(response);
              });
          } else {
            streamChannel.leave().then((response) => {
              console.log(response);
              messageCallback("Left the channel: " + streamChannelName);
              streamChannel = null;
            });
          }
        };
      ```

<a name='topic'></a>
### Join and leave a topic

     A topic is a data stream management mechanism in stream channels. Users join, leave, subscribe, and
    unsubscribe to topics. You join a topic to publish and recieve messages sent to all users in the topic.
    You subscribe to listen to messages sent by publishers only. When a user joins or leaves a topic, <Vg k="MESS"/>
    triggers an topic event notification. Users in the channel receive the notifications in real time. You use topic events
    to track changes in topic status. To join a topic:

      ```javascript
      const topicJoinAndLeave = async function (isTopicJoined, topicName) {
        if (isTopicJoined === false) {
          await signalingManager.getSignalingStreamChannel().joinTopic(topicName).then((response) => {
            messageCallback("Joined the topic: " + response.topicName);
          });
        } else {
          signalingManager.getSignalingStreamChannel().leaveTopic(topicName).then((response) => {
            console.log(response);
            messageCallback("Left the topic: " + response.topicName);
          });
        }
      };
      ```
      There is no limit to the number of subscribers and publishers in each topic. However, there are limitations to
      the [number of topics and messages a user can subscribe to](/en/signaling/reference/limitations).

### Publish messages to a topic

   Messages are transmitted through the topic. After your user has joined a topic in a channel, you
   publish messages to the topic. Publishers and subscribers receive the messages. To send a message:

    ```javascript
    const sendTopicMessage = function (message, topicName) {
      if (message === "" || topicName === "") {
        console.log(
          "Make sure you specified a message and a topic to send messages"
        );
        return;
      }
      signalingManager.getSignalingStreamChannel().publishTopicMessage(topicName, message).then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
        messageCallback("Topic: " + topicName + ",  Message:" + message);
      });
    };
    ```

### Subscribe to a topic

    To receive messages published to a topic, you subscribe to the topic. To subscribe:

    ```javascript
    await signalingManager.getSignalingStreamChannel().subscribeTopic(topicName);
    ```javascript
