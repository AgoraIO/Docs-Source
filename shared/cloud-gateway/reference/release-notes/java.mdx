v4.4.30 was released on October XX, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

**Log encryption behavior changes**

For security and performance reasons, as of this release, the SDK encrypts logs and no longer supports printing plaintext logs via the console.

Refer to the following solutions for different needs:

- If you need to know the API call status, check the API logs and print the SDK callback logs yourself.
- For any other special requirements, contact technical support and provide the corresponding encrypted logs.

#### New features

**Maven integration method**

This release supports integrating the SDK through Maven. After creating a Maven project, open the `pom.xml` file and replace its contents with the following:

**Audio send buffer settings**

In scenarios such as AI interaction, the frequency of sending audio frames may be uneven. If the SDK sends to the Agora server according to the actual sending frequency, the receiver may experience issues such as stuttering or frame loss. To optimize audio transmission performance, this release adds methods to set the audio send buffer in the `AgoraLocalAudioTrack` class:

- `setMaxBufferedAudioFrameNumber`: Sets the maximum capacity of the audio send buffer.
- `clearSenderBuffer`: Clears the current audio send buffer, applicable to interrupt audio in human-machine dialogue scenarios.
- `setSendDelayMs`: Sets the minimum data duration allowed to be sent by the audio send buffer, applicable to precise control of audio transmission delay.

**Audio labels**

This release introduces the audio labeling capability (`AudioLabel`). By adding audio labels, you can intuitively obtain audio information such as user audio energy, fundamental frequency, and voice type, making it convenient for post-processing. Contact technical support to enable and use this feature.

**22050 Hz audio send sample rate**

This release supports a 22050 Hz audio send sample rate, and you can set the sample rate when calling the `AgoraAudioPcmDataSender.send` method to send raw audio data.

**SDK global custom parameters**

This release adds the `getAgoraParameter` method in the `AgoraService` class. The difference between this method and the `getAgoraParameter` method in the `AgoraRtcConn` class is as follows:

- `AgoraService.getAgoraParameter` is effective globally for the SDK.
- `AgoraRtcConn.getAgoraParameter` is only effective for the current connection.

#### Improvements

This release includes the following improvements:

- Reduces CPU consumption in multi-channel scenarios.
- Optimizes memory management mechanism for audio frame callbacks `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing`, `onRecordAudioFrame`, `onPlaybackAudioFrame`, and `onMixedAudioFrame`, improving the efficiency and stability of `AudioFrame` processing.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Issues caused by a null `channelId` pointer in the `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing` callback.
- Occasional crashes in the `onRemoteAudioTrackStatistics`, `onUserAudioTrackSubscribed`, `onUserAudioTrackStateChanged`, `onUserVideoTrackSubscribed`, `onUserVideoTrackStateChanged`, or `onRemoteVideoTrackStatistics` callbacks.
