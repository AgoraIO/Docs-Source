### Retrieve a list of conversations from the server

Call `GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor` to retrieve conversations from the server with pagination. You can set the  `pinOnly` parameter in this method to determine whether to retrieve the list of pinned conversations:
- If `pinOnly` is set to `false`, you can retrieve the list of pinned and unpinned conversations. The SDK returns the conversation list in the reverse chronological order of when conversations are active (the timestamp of the last message in the conversation).
- If `pinOnly` is set to `true`, you can only retrieve the list of pinned conversations. The SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they were pinned. Up to 50 pinned conversations can be retrieved.

In the conversation list, each conversation object contains the conversation ID, conversation type, whether the conversation is pinned, the pinned time (the value is 0 for an unpinned conversation), and the last message in the conversation. After the conversation list is retrieved from the server, the local conversation list will be updated accordingly. We recommend calling this method when the app is first installed, or when there is no conversation on the local device. Otherwise, you can call `LoadAllConversations` to retrieve conversations on the local device.
The server stores 100 conversations for 7 days by default. To increase the two upper limits, contact support@agora.io. Agora Chat server can store up to 3,000 conversation per end user.

```csharp
// limit: The number of conversations that you expect to get on each page. The value range is [1,50].
int limit = 10;
string cursor = "";
bool pinOnly = false; // `false`ï¼šGet all conversations; `true`: Get the list of pinned conversations.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor(pinOnly, cursor, limit, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Conversation>>(
   onSuccess: (result) =>
   {
       // Traverse the obtained conversation list
       foreach (var conv in result.Data)
       {

       }
       // The cursor for the next request
       string nextCursor = result.Cursor;
   },
   onError: (code, desc) =>
   {

   }
));
```

### Retrieve message history of the specified conversation

You can call `FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy` based on the `FetchServerMessagesOption` class to pull message history of a one-to-one or group chat from the server. To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull 20 messages at a time, with a maximum of 50. If the total number of messages that meet the query conditions is greater than the `pageSize` value, then only the `pageSize` number of messages will be returned. When the message query is completed, the number of returned messages is less than the `pageSize` value.

Using the `FetchServerMessagesOption` class, you can pull message history with the following conditions:

- message sender,
- message type,
- message time period,
- message search direction,
- whether to save the pulled messages to the database.

For group chats, you can set the `from` parameter to pull messages sent by individual members of the group.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note">
<ul><li>To use this API, upgrade to v1.3.0 or above.</li>
<li>By default, you can retrieve message history of one-to-one and group chats. To obtain message history of a chat room, contact support@agora.io.</li>
<li>The storage time of message history and offline messages on the server is defined by your pricing package. See [Pricing plan details](../../reference/pricing-plan-details).</li>
<li>For event notifications, if the receiving user is offline, the storage time of the event notification is consistent with the storage time of the offline message, which also depends on your pricing package.</li></ul>
</Admonition>

Refer to the following sample code:

```csharp
FetchServerMessagesOption option = new FetchServerMessagesOption();
   // Message search direction. `UP` means pull the latest message first; `DOWN` means pull the oldest message first.
   option.Direction = MessageSearchDirection.UP;
   // The user ID of the message sender, only used for group messages, that is, used when the `type` in `FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy` is `ConversationType.Group`.
   option.From = "xxx";
   // Array of the message type to pull. If no value is passed, all types of messages will be pulled.
   option.MsgTypes = new List<MessageBodyType>() { MessageBodyType.TXT };
   // The starting timestamp of the query, in milliseconds.
   option.StartTime = 1709284487000;
   // The end timestamp of the query, in milliseconds.
   option.EndTime = 1709284499000;

   // conversationId: The peer user ID for a one-to-one chat, group ID for a chat group, and chat room ID for a chat room.
   // type: Conversation type: `Chat`, `Group`, or `Room`.
   // cursor: The starting message ID of the query. If this parameter is set to an empty string, start from the latest message.
   // pageSize: The number of messages expected to be pulled per page. The value range is [1,50], and the default value is 10.
   // option: Find option of type `FetchServerMessagesOption`.
   SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServerBy(conversationId, type:ConversationType.Group, cursor:"", pageSize:10, option, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
       onSuccess: (result) =>
       {
           if (0 == result.Data.Count)
           {
               return;
           }
           foreach (var msg in result.Data)
           {
               // Process every msg
           }
       },
       onError: (code, desc) =>
       {
       }
   ));
```

You can also call `FetchHistoryMessagesFromServer` to pull messages of a specified conversation from the server.

To ensure data reliability, we recommend that you pull a maximum of 50 messages at a time and do multiple iterations, if necessary. After pulling, the SDK will automatically update the message to the local database.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.FetchHistoryMessagesFromServer(conversationId, type, startId, pageSize, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Message>>(
     // Message history retrieved successfully.
     // Result is of type CursorResult<Message>.
     onSuccess: (result) => {
     },

     // Failed to retrieve message history.
     onError:(code, desc) => {
     }
));
```

### Pin a conversation

To keep track of an important conversation, you can pin it to the top of your conversation list. You can pin up to 50 conversations.  The pinned state is stored on the server. In a multi-device login scenario, if you pin or unpin a conversation, other login devices will receive the `CONVERSATION_PINNED` or `CONVERSATION_UNPINNED` events.

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.PinConversation(convId, isPinned, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {

    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {

    }
));
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server

End users can pin up to 50 conversations. After you call this API, the SDK returns the pinned conversations in the reverse chronological order of when they are pinned.

Agora Chat servers store a list of conversations that remain active in the past 7 days, regardless of Agora Chat package subscription. A conversation is considered active if it is pinned or there are new messages in a conversation.

The Limit parameter specifies the number of conversations each API call can return, from a range of 1-50. Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```csharp
// limit: The number of sessions returned per page. The value range is [1,50].
// cursor: The cursor position to start getting data.
int limit = 10;
string cursor = "";
bool pinOnly = true; // `false`: Get the list of all conversations; `true`: Get the list of only pinned conversations.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor(pinOnly, cursor, limit, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Conversation>>(
   onSuccess: (result) =>
   {
       // Traverse the obtained conversation list
       foreach (var conv in result.Data)
       {

       }
       // The cursor for the next query
       string nextCursor = result.Cursor;
   },
   onError: (code, desc) =>
   {

   }
));
```

### Pin a message

You can call `ChatManager#PinMessage` to pin a message to the top of a group or room chat, that is, set the `isPinned` parameter to `true`. When the pinned status of a message changes, other members in the group or chat room conversation will receive the `IChatManagerDelegate#OnMessagePinChanged` event. In the case of multi-device login, the updated top status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `IChatManagerDelegate#OnMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

In group and chat room conversations, multiple users can pin the same message to the top. The latest pinned message will overwrite the earlier information. That is, the `PinnedInfo` user ID and pin time will correspond to the latest pinned message.

If the message is stored locally but deleted on the server due to expiration, the message will fail to be pinned to the top.

For a single conversation, 20 messages can be pinned to the top by default.

```csharp
bool isPinned = true;
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.PinMessage(msgId, isPinned, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Unpin a message

You can call `ChatManager#PinMessage` to unpin a message in a group or room chat, that is, set the `isPinned` parameter to `false`. As with pinned messages, other members of the group or chat room will receive the `IChatManagerDelegate#OnMessagePinChanged` event when the pinned message is unpinned. In the case of multi-device login, the updated pin status will be synchronized to other logged-in devices, and other devices will receive the `IChatManagerDelegate#OnMessagePinChanged` event, respectively.

Any user in a group or room can unpin a message, regardless of who pinned it. After unpinning a message, `PinnedBy` and `PinnedAt` in `Message#PinnedInfo` are returned empty and set to `0`, respectively, and the message is no longer included in the pinned message list.

```csharp
bool isPinned = false;
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.PinMessage(msgId, isPinned, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Get pinned messages in a single conversation

You can call `ChatManager#GetPinnedMessagesFromServer` to get the pinned messages from a single conversation from the server. The SDK returns messages in the reverse order of pinning.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetPinnedMessagesFromServer(convId, new ValueCallBack<List<Message>>(
    onSuccess: (list) => {
        foreach (var it in list)
        {
            // Traverse the message list
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

### Get pinned details of a single message

You can call `PinnedInfo` to get the pinned details of a single message.

- If the message is pinned, this class returns the time of pinning and the user ID of the user who has pinned it.
- If the message is not pinned, then `PinnedBy` is returned empty and `PinnedAt` is set to `0`.

```csharp
// ...
const msg: ChatMessage;
const info = await msg.getPinInfo;
// todo: Get the pin information of the message
```

### Delete historical messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `RemoveMessagesFromServer` to delete historical messages one way from the server. You can remove a maximum of 50 messages from the server each time. Once the messages are deleted, you can no longer retrieve them from the server. The deleted messages are automatically removed from your local device. Other chat users can still get the messages from the server.

<div class="alert note">To use this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable it.</div>

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, time, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveMessagesFromServer(convId, ctype, msgList, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Delete conversations and related messages from the server unidirectionally

Call `DeleteConversationFromServer` to delete conversations and their historical messages unidirectionally from the server. After the conversations and messages are deleted from the server, you can no longer get them from the server. The deleted conversations still exist on your local device, but the messages are automatically removed from the device. Other chat users can still get the conversations and their historical messages from the server.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversationFromServer(conversationId, conversationType, isDeleteServerMessages, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Tag a conversation

To tag a conversation, use the `MarkConversations` method. This method allows you to add tags to both local and server-side conversations, that is, set the `isMark` parameter to 'true'. Each conversation can have up to 20 tags. This feature applies only to private chats and chat groups.

After adding a tag, you can retrieve the tagged conversations from the server by calling the `GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor` method. The returned conversation objects will include the conversation tag, which you can obtain using the `marks` property.

If the server conversation list reaches its limit (default 100 conversations per user), inactive conversations will be deleted based on conversation activity (timestamp of the latest message). Consequently, the conversation tags of these deleted conversations will also be removed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Hint">Adding tags to a conversation, such as stars, does not affect other logic of the conversation, such as the number of unread messages in it.</Admonition>

```csharp
List<string> list = new List<string>();
list.Add("huanhuan");
bool isMarked = true;
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.MarkConversations(list, isMarked, (MarkType)mark, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Remove conversation tag

You can call `MarkConversations` and set the `isMark` parameter to 'false' to untag a conversation. Tags can be removed for up to 20 conversations at a time. Calling this method removes both the local and server-side tags.

```csharp
List<string> list = new List<string>();
list.Add("huanhuan");
bool isMarked = false;
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.MarkConversations(list, isMarked, (MarkType)mark, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () =>
    {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
    }
));
```

### Query conversations from the server by the conversation tag

You can use the `GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor` method to retrieve a list of conversations from the server based on the tag. The SDK returns the conversation list in reverse order of the conversation tag's timestamp. Each conversation object includes the following information:

- Conversation ID
- Conversation type
- Pinned status (whether it is pinned or not)
- Pin time (if the conversation is pinned; otherwise, the value is 0)
- Conversation tag
- Latest message

After fetching the conversation list from the server, the local conversation list is updated accordingly:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversationsFromServerWithCursor((MarkType)mark, cursor, limit, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<Conversation>>(
   onSuccess: (result) =>
   {
       foreach (var conv in result.Data)
       {
       	//Iterate over the sessions in result.Data
       }
   },
   onError: (code, desc) =>
   {
   }
  ));
```

### Query local conversations by the conversation tag

For local conversations, you can call the `LoadAllConversations` method to obtain all local conversations and then perform conversation filtering yourself. The following is an example of querying all local conversations marked with `EMConversation.EMMarkType.MARK_0`:

```csharp
// All final query results are put into result.
List<Conversation> result = new List<Conversation>();
List<Conversation> localConversations = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.LoadAllConversations();
foreach(var conv in localConversations)
{
    List<MarkType> Marks = conv.Marks();
    foreach(var mark in Marks)
    {
        if (MarkType.MarkType0 == mark)
        {
            result.Add(conv);
        }
    }
}
```

### Get all tags of a local conversation

You can call `Conversation#Marks` to get all the tags of a local conversation. The sample code is as follows:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation("conversationId", conversationType);
List<MarkType> Marks = conv.Marks();
```
