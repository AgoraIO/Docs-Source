## Understand the tech

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
The following figure shows the basic workflow of Agora Chat:

![1655713515869](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1655713515869)

Assume that User A sends a message to User B, but User B goes offline before receiving it. The Agora Chat server pushes a notification to the device of User B via FCM and temporarily stores this message. Once User B comes back online, the Agora Chat SDK pulls the message from the server and pushes the message to User B using persistent connections.
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
The Agora Chat SDK allows you to implement the following features:

- Set the push notifications of an app
- Retrieve the push notification setting of an app
- Set the push notifications of a conversation
- Retrieve the push notification settings of one conversation or multiple conversations
- Clear the push notification mode of a conversation
- Set and retrieve the preferred language of push notifications
</PlatformWrapper>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- You have initialized the Agora Chat SDK. For details, see [Get Started with Android](./agora_chat_get_started_android).
- You understand the call frequency limit of the Agora Chat APIs supported by different pricing plans as described in [Limitations](../reference/limitations).
- You have activated the advanced features for push in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/). Advanced features allow you to set the push notification mode, do-not-disturb mode, and custom push template.
<div class="alert note">You must contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a> to disable the advanced features for push as this operation will delete all the relevant configurations.</div>
