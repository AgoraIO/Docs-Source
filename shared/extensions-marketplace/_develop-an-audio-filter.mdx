## Understand the tech

An audio filter accesses voice data when it is captured from the user's local device, modifies it, then plays the updated data to local and remote video channels.

A typical transmission pipeline consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, pre-processing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and play. In order to modify the voice or video data in the transmission pipeline, audio extensions are inserted into either the pre-processing or post-processing procedure.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequisites />
* A project to develop in.

## Project setup

In order to integrate an extension into your project:

<ProjectSetup />

You are now ready to develop your extension.

## Create an audio extension

To create an extension in your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project, use the following APIs:

<ProjectImplimentation />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have integrated the extension in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:
