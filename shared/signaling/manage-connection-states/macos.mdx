## Call APIs to change connection states

You can use the state and cause for the state change returned by the `connectionStateChanged` callback to actively call the API to change the connection state in the following situations.

### Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />

When you call `loginByToken` to log in to <Vg k="SIG" />, the connection state changes from `AgoraRtmConnectionStateDisconnected` to `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnecting`, and the cause for the state change is `AgoraRtmConnectionChangeReasonLogin`. When the state is `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnecting`, the connection state automatically changes to one of the following states:

-   `AgoraRtmConnectionStateDisconnected`: The login fails or times out (the user fails to log in within 12 seconds).

-   `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnected`: The login succeeds.

When the connection state turns to AgoraRtmConnectionStateDisconnected, you need to call `loginByToken` again to log in.

### Disconnected from <Vg k="SIG" /> due to network problems

When the connection state is `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnected`, if the connection with the Agora RTM system is interrupted and cannot recover in four seconds due to network reasons, the connection state changes to `AgoraRtmConnectionStateReconnecting`, and the cause for the state change is `AgoraRtmConnectionChangeReasonInterrupted`. When in the `AgoraRtmConnectionStateReconnecting` state, the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> continues to automatically reconnect to <Vg k="SIG" /> until the login is successful, so you do not need to perform any login operations. After successful reconnection, the connection state changes to `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnected`, but the SDK does not return the `AgoraRtmLoginBlock` callback.

The SDK resends messages that occurred during the disconnection period according to the following guidelines:

-   Sender
    During the reconnection period, the SDK continues to send all channel and peer-to-peer messages until the message request times out.

-   Receiver
    After the reconnection succeeds, <Vg k="SIG" /> resends all of the peer-to-peer messages sent during the disconnection period but only the channel messages from the 30-second period immediately before reconnection (up to a maximum of 32 messages) to the receiver.

If the reconnection keeps failing, the connection state remains at `AgoraRtmConnectionStateReconnecting`. You can call `logoutWithCompletion` to log out of the system first, and then call the `loginByToken` method to reconnect at an appropriate time.

<Vg k="SIG" /> responds differently per the length of time between the interruption of the connection and the successful reconnection:

-   If the user successfully logs in again within 30 seconds of the interruption, the connection state changes to the `AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnected`. The userâ€™s online state remains unchanged.

-   If the user is still offline 30 seconds after the interruption, <Vg k="SIG" /> removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `memberLeft` callback. If the user successfully logs in later, the connection state changes to the AgoraRtmConnectionStateConnected. The SDK automatically adds the user to the previous channel, and users in the same channel receive the `memberJoined` callback. Because <Vg k="SIG" /> has removed the user from the online list, the SDK will also automatically synchronize user attributes to <Vg k="SIG" />.

In the `AgoraRtmConnectionStateReconnecting` state, the SDK keeps reconnecting to the Agora RTM system. If the token expires, the SDK returns the `rtmKitTokenDidExpire` callback, which does not affect the connection state.

### Kicked out of <Vg k="SIG" />

If the same user ID logs in to <Vg k="SIG" /> from another client instance, the user who is currently connected in the client instance gets kicked out by <Vg k="SIG" />, and the connection state changes to `AgoraRtmConnectionStateAborted`. You can call `logoutWithCompletion` to log out of the system first, and then call the `loginByToken` method to reconnect in an appropriate time.

### Log out of <Vg k="SIG" />

If you call `logoutWithCompletion` to log out of <Vg k="SIG" />, the connection state changes to `AgoraRtmConnectionStateDisconnected`. The RTM system removes the user from the online user list and channel, and users in the same channel receive the `memberLeft` callback.

## Sample code

Refer to the following sample code to monitor the connection state:
    ```objc
    // Monitors the connection state
    - (void)rtmKit:(AgoraRtmKit *)kit connectionStateChanged:(AgoraRtmConnectionState)state reason:(AgoraRtmConnectionChangeReason)reason {
        NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"connection state changed: %ld", state];
    }
    ```
