### Subscribe to a channel

Use the `subscribe` method to subscribe to a message channel. After you subscribe, you receive `onMessageEvent` and other event notifications within the channel.

```cpp
SubscribeOptions sub_opt;

u_int64_t req_id;

int ret = rtm_client->subscribe("channel_name", sub_opt, req_id);

if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
    printf("subscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
}
```

When you call `subscribe`, the SDK triggers the `onSubscribeResult` callback.

```cpp
// Asynchronous callback

class RtmEventHandler : public IRtmEventHandler {
  void onSubscribeResult(const uint64_t requestId, const char *channelName, RTM_ERROR_CODE errorCode) {
    if (errorCode != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
        printf("subscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", errorCode, getErrorReason(errorCode));
    } else {
      printf("subscribe rtm channel %s success\n", channelName);
    }
  }
};
```

To subscribe to multiple channels, call `subscribe` multiple times:

```cpp
SubscribeOptions sub_opt;
u_int64_t req_id;

int ret = rtm_client->subscribe("chats.room1", sub_opt, req_id);

if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
  printf("subscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
}

ret = rtm_client->subscribe("chats.room2", sub_opt, req_id);

if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
  printf("subscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
}
```

<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> allows a single client to subscribe to up to 50 message channels simultaneously. However, to optimize client performance and bandwidth usage, best practice is to limit subscriptions to 30 channels. If you have very large or highly active channels, consider further reducing the number of simultaneous subscriptions.

### Send a message

To send messages in a message channel, simply call the `publish` method without subscribing to the channel. This method sends messages to one channel at a time. To send messages to multiple channels, call this method multiple times. <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> does not limit the number of channels to which you can send messages, or the number of users who can send messages to a channel. However, there are certain restrictions on the frequency at which you can send messages to a channel simultaneously. See [API usage restrictions](../reference/limitations) for details.

<Admonition type="alert" title="Info">
The `publish` method can only be used with a message channel and a user channel; it does not apply to a stream channel.
</Admonition>

Refer to the following sample code for sending messages:

* String message

    ```cpp
    // Sending string message
    PublishOptions pub_opt;
    pub_opt.type = RTM_MESSAGE_TYPE_STRING;
    pub_opt.customType = "PlainText";

    std::string msg = "hello world";
    ret = rtm_client->publish("channel_name", msg.c_str(), msg.size(), pub_opt, req_id);
    if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
    printf("publish message failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
    }
    ```

* Binary message

    ```cpp
    // Sending a binary message
    PublishOptions pub_opt;
    pub_opt.type = RTM_MESSAGE_TYPE_BINARY;
    pub_opt.customType = "ByteArray";

    char byte_data[5] = {0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04};

    ret = rtm_client->publish("channel_name", byte_data, 5, pub_opt, req_id);
    if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
        printf("publish message failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
    }
    ```
<Admonition>
<Vg k="SIG" /> currently supports only string and binary message formats. To send other types of data such as a JSON objects, or data from third-party data construction tools such as protobuf, serialize the data before sending the message. For information on how to effectively construct the payload data structure and recommended serialization methods, refer to [Message payload structuring](../best-practices/message-payload-structuring).
</Admonition>

When you call `publish`, the SDK triggers the `onPublishResult` callback.

```cpp
class RtmEventHandler : public IRtmEventHandler {
  void onPublishResult(const uint64_t requestId, RTM_ERROR_CODE errorCode) override {
    if (errorCode != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
      printf("publish message failed error is %d reason is %s\n", errorCode, getErrorReason(errorCode));
    } else {
      printf("publish message success\n");
    }
  }
};
```

### Customize channel subscription

By default, you receive message events for all channels you subscribe to. If you don't wish to receive messages from specific channels, while still receiving other types of event notifications from these channels, adjust the subscription settings accordingly. Refer to the following code snippet:

```cpp
SubscribeOptions sub_opt;
sub_opt.withMessage = false;

u_int64_t req_id;

int ret = rtm_client->subscribe("channel_name", sub_opt, req_id);

if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
  printf("subscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
}
```

When you set the `withMessage` property in the `SubscribeOptions` to `false`, messages from `channel_name` do not trigger event notifications. However, you continue to receive notifications for other events, such as presence updates, metadata changes, and lock status alterations.

### Unsubscribe from a channel

To stop receiving message and all other event notifications from a channel, call `unsubscribe`.

```cpp
int ret = rtm_client->unsubscribe("chats.room1");
if (ret != RTM_ERROR_OK) {
    printf("unsubscribe rtm channel failed error is %d reason is %s\n", ret, getErrorReason(ret));
} else {
    printf("unsubscribe success");
}
```

This method only unsubscribes from one channel at a time. To unsubscribe from multiple channels, call this method multiple times.
