By default, the SDK generates three log files, `easemob.log` and two `easemob_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log` files, each with a maximum size of 2048 KB (2 MB). These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest logs in `easemob.log`. When `easemob.log` is full, the SDK renames it to the name of the current time-dependent log file. If there are more than three log files, the SDK deletes the earliest log file, and creates a new `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

For example, the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record logs at 8:00:00 a.m. on January 1, 2024. If this file is completely written at 8:30:00 a.m., the SDK renames it `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log`. At 9:30:00 a.m. and 10:30:30 a.m., the SDK generates `easemob_2024-01-01_09-30-30.log` and `easemob_2024-01-01_10-30-30.log`. At this time, `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log` will be removed before the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

In debugging mode, the SDK outputs all types of logs, including debugging information, warnings, and errors. By default, the SDK only outputs error logs. Therefore, to output all logs, enable the debugging mode.

```csharp
Options options = new Options("YourAppKey");
options.DebugMode = true;
SDKClient.Instance.InitWithOptions(options);
```

## Collect SDK logs

Windows SDK logs reside in the `sdkdata\easemobLog` directory which is at the same level as the directory of the executable program.
