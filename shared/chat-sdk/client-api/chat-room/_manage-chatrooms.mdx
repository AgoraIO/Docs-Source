<Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>s enable real-time messaging among multiple users.

<Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> does not have a strict membership, and members do not retain any permanent relationship with each other. Once going offline, chat room members cannot receive any messages from the chat room and automatically leave the chat room after 2 minutes (members on the chat room allow list remain in the chat room even if they stay offline for 2 minutes or more). <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> is widely applied in live broadcast use cases such as stream chat in Twitch.

This page shows how to use the Chat SDK to create and manage a <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> in your app.
