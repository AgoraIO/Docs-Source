The following figure shows the overall technical architecture of <Vg k="FC"/>:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

The source code of <Vg k="FC"/> contains the following packages:

- `agora-demo-app`: The <Vg k="ACS"/> demo app, supports Web, H5, Electron and other platforms, supports online classroom, online invigilation function, and provides code samples for online classroom before, during, and after class.
- `agora-classroom-sdk`: The <Vg k="ACS"/>, which contains the following modules:
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
    - `/src/infra/capabilities`:
        - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
        - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.
- `agora-proctor-sdk`: The Agora Classroom invigilation scene SDK, including the following modules:
    - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
- `/src/infra/capabilities`:
        - `/containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
        - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.
- `agora-plugin-gallery`: An independent plug-in library for <Vg k="ACS"/>, which inherits the `AgoraWidgetBase` class and implements the `AgoraWidgetLifecycle` interface. It includes plug-ins such as interactive whiteboard, IM chat, answering machine, voting machine, and timer.

## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> into your web project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-classroom-sdk) or CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13) on GitHub.

### Use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>

If you are satisfied with the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/> and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through npm or CDN.

#### Through npm

1. To install the SDK, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install agora-classroom-sdk
    ```

2. To import the `AgoraEduSDK` module, add the following code in the Javascript code in your project.

    ```
    import {AgoraEduSDK} from 'agora-classroom-sdk'
    ```

3. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

#### Through CDN

1. Add the following code to the HTML file in your project:

    ```html
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.8.13.bundle.js"></script>
    ```

2. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

#### Sample code

```html
<script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.8.13.bundle.js"></script>
<style>
    #root {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>
<script type="text/javascript">
    // Configure the SDK and provide your App ID
    AgoraEduSDK.config({
        appId: 'Your App ID',
        region: 'NA'
    });

    // Launch Flexible Classroom
    AgoraEduSDK.launch(document.querySelector('#root'), {
        userUuid: 'user id',
        userName: 'user name',
        roomUuid: 'room id',
        roleType: 1, // Role type: 1 for teachers, 2 for students.
        roomType: 0, // Room type: 0 for a one-to-one classroom, 2 for a lecture hall (a common lecture hall or a vocational lecture hall depending on room sub-type), 4 for a small classroom.
        roomSubType: 0, // Room sub-type. The default value is 0. To set a vocational lecture hall, set roomType as 2 and roomSubType as 1.
        roomName: 'room name',
        pretest: true, // Whether to enable the pre-class device test.
        rtmToken: 'rtm token', // In a test environment, you can use a temporary token; in a production or security environment, Agora strongly recommends that you use a server-generated token.
        language: 'en', // The language on the classroom UI: zh for Chinese and en for English.
        duration: 60 * 30, // The duration of the class (in seconds).
        recordUrl: 'https://solutions-apaas.agora.io/apaas/record/dev/2.8.13/record_page.html',
        courseWareList: [],
        virtualBackgroundImages: [], // Virtual background picture resource list
        webrtcExtensionBaseUrl: 'https://solutions-apaas.agora.io/static', //WebRTC Plug-in deployment address
        uiMode: 'light', // The theme of the classroom UI: light for the light mode, dark for the dark mode.
        listener: (evt, args) => {
        },
    }).then(() => {
        console.log('start launch');
    }).catch((e) => {
        console.error('failed to launch', e);
    });
</script>
```

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what a <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purposes, and how to generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, you need to integrate <Vg k="FC"/> by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:

<div class="alert info">Make sure you have <a href="../get-started">set up a development environment</a>.</div>

1. Clone the Flexible-Classroom-Desktop repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop.git
   ```

2. [checkout the latest release branch](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/flexible-classroom-desktop/tree/release/2.8.13).

    1. Change directory to `flexible-classroom-desktop`

    1. Switch the branch, run the following commands:

        ```bash
        cd flexible-classroom-desktop
        git checkout release/2.8.13
        ```

3. Pull the sub-modules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-classroom-sdk
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-proctor-sdk
    git submodule update --init --recursive packages/agora-plugin-gallery
    ```

    After pulling the code to your local device, you are free to edit the code according to your needs. You can refer to the [Customize the Classroom UI guide](../develop/customize-ui).

4. Debug your code.

    After finishing the development, follow these steps to debug:

    1. To install dependencies, run the following command:

        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

        ```bash
        yarn bootstrap
        ```

    1. Rename the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory to `.env`:

        ```
        mv .env.example .env
        ```

    1. Fill in your App ID and App Certificate in the `.env` file as follows:

        ```
        REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID={your appid}
        REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE={your app certificate}
        ```

    1. To run the project in development mode, use the following commands:

        ```bash
        yarn dev
        ```

5. After finishing the development, pack the SDK JS file with the following command:

    ```bash
    yarn pack:classroom:sdk
    ```
