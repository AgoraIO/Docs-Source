- Up to 17 hosts can be supported in the same live streaming channel.
- This service is not free. Agora charges for the use of this service based on the duration of the audio and video transcoding.
- Agora supports pushing streams in the RTMP and RTMPS protocols, but the RTMPS protocol is supported only in transcoding mode.
- If you push the stream directly without transcoding for a single host, you can skip [Step1](#single), and call the `AddPublishStreamUrl` method directly with `transcodingEnabled (false)`.

  <div class="alert note">Currently, Agora only supports pushing H.264 (default) streams to the CDN.</div>

- Ensure that the stream URLs used in the transcoding mode and non-transcoding mode are different.
