A subscription package is a prepaid billing method. You can purchase a package in the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io) to cover usage for the current month.

This page explains how to purchase, and manage subscription and top-up packages.

### Purchase and upgrade

By default, each project is assigned the Free Package upon creation. You can upgrade at any time to the Starter, Pro, Business, Business Plus, or Enterprise package. Higher-tier packages provide greater discounts and lower unit prices. For details, see [Pricing](pricing).

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- All packages, except the Enterprise package can be purchased directly from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To upgrade to the Enterprise package, contact [Agora sales](mailto:sales@agora.io).
- You can upgrade sequentially or skip levels. For example, you may upgrade from Starter to Business Plus directly.
- Package upgrades take effect immediately on the day of the upgrade. If multiple upgrades are made on the same day, the last upgrade is applied.
</Admonition>

#### Upgrade rules

* When you purchase or upgrade to a paid package, it becomes effective for the entire month, regardless of the purchase date. You are charged the full monthly price, and you receive the full monthly allocation of included minutes.

### Renewal

By default, the subscription package renews automatically on the 25th of each month for the following month. Ensure your account has sufficient balance to avoid renewal failure. You can unsubscribe at any time to prevent renewal.

If renewal fails:

- The system sends a notification and retries the renewal.
- If renewal still fails by the end of the month, the package downgrades to the Free package.
- To restore the previous package, see [Purchase and Upgrade](#purchase-and-upgrade).

### Downgrade

You can downgrade by selecting and purchasing a lower-tier package. Downgrades take effect on the next renewal date, depending on when the request is made.

#### Examples:

* **Requested on August 15**: Downgrade takes effect in September.
* **Requested on August 26**: Requests made after the 25th take effect on the renewal date at the end of the next month. In this example, the downgrade takes effect in October.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- You can cancel a downgrade request before it takes effect.
- While a downgrade request is pending, you cannot make further upgrade/downgrade changes.
</Admonition>

### Cancel subscription

Click the **Cancel** button under the subscribed paid plan to unsubscribe the package.  Cancelling a paid package downgrades you to the Free package; downgrade rules apply. 

## Top-up package

A top-up package is a pay-as-you-go plan. You can purchase a top-up package from the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io/v2) to cover usage that exceeds your monthly package quota.

### Purchase

You can purchase multiple top-up packages. They are deducted in the order of purchase.

#### Example:

* Purchased 250,000-minute top-up packages on **August 15** and **August 16**. On **September 1**, the first package is used before the second.

### Validity

Each top-up package is valid for one year, starting from the purchase date to the end of the same month of the following year.

#### Example:

* Purchased on **August 15, 2025** â†’ valid until **August 31, 2026**

Unused minutes expire after the validity period and cannot be carried forward.

### Cancel top-up package

Cancelling a top-up package is not supported.
