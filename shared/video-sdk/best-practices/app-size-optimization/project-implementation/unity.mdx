Open the `Assets/Agora-RTC-Plugin/Agora-Unity-RTC-SDK/Plugins` folder in Unity Editor. It contains dynamic libraries for iOS, macOS, Windows, and Android. As shown below:

- **Android**: If your target platform is Android, consider deleting the following files under the path `Android/AgoraRtcEngineKit.plugin/libs`:

   - `arm64-v8a/<*>_extension.so`
   - `armeabi-v7a/<*>_extension.so`
   - `x86/<*>_extension.so`
   - `x86_64/<*>_extension.so`

    Only delete these files if they are not required for your application to function correctly.

- **iOS**: If your target platform is iOS, you can safely delete any unused `<*>Extension.framework` files located in the `iOS` folder of your project.

- **macOS**: For macOS targets, you may delete any unused `<*>Extension.framework` files found in the `macOS/AgoraRtcWrapperUnity.bundle/Contents/Frameworks` path. 

- **Windows**: If targeting Windows, you have the option to delete `<*>extension.dll` or `<*>extension.dll.lib` files located in the `x86` or `x86_64` folder. 

Exercise caution when deleting files, and always make sure that any removals do not impact the functionality of your application.

### Delete files from the exported native project

When exporting a native project from Unity for a target platform, the dynamic library corresponding to that platform is copied to the native project. To remove unnecessary files, delete the dynamic libraries ending with `extension` directly from the exported native project.
