If your target platform is iOS:

1. Open the `.xcworkspace` file under the ios folder with Xcode.
1. Create a Broadcast Upload extension and make sure "Include UI Extension" is unchecked.
    - File > New > Target > Broadcast upload extension
1. Set the `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` property of the `Info.plist` file inside the target to `AgoraReplayKitHandler`.
1. To include `Agora RTC` dependency to the newly created Broadcast Upload extension target, add the following lines at the end of the iOS Podfile:

```swift
target 'ScreenShareExtension' do
pod 'AgoraIrisRTC_iOS', '<version number>'
end
```
   Replace `ScreenShareExtension` with the name of the extension you have created. Similarly, replace `<version number>` with the correct version number, for example, `~> 4.1`.
