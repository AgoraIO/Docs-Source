To test various audio and video interaction use-cases, connect to the [Agora web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html), or install and run the sample project on a second device. Make sure you use the same app ID on both devices. When you join the same channel from two devices, you can see and hear each other.
