#### <a name="33"></a>33 uploading_progress

`eventType` 33 indicates the current upload progress. The Agora server notifies you of the upload progress once every minute after the recording starts. `details` includes the following fields:

- `msgName`: String. The message name, `uploading_progress`.
- `progress`: Number. An ever-increasing number between 0 and 10,000, equal to the ratio of the number of the uploaded files to the number of the recorded files multiplied by 10,000. After the recording service exits and when the number reaches 10,000, the upload completes.

#### <a name="40"></a>40 recorder_started

`eventType` 40 indicates that the recording service starts, and `details` includes the following fields:

- `msgName`: String. The message name, `recorder_started`.
- `status`: Number. The event status. 0 indicates normal status; other values indicate abnormal status.

#### <a name="41"></a>41 recorder_leave

`eventType` 41 indicates that the recorder leaves the channel, and `details` includes the following fields:

- `msgName`: String. The message name, `recorder_leave`.
- `leaveCode`: Number. The leave code. You can perform a bitwise AND operation on the code and each enum value, and those with non-zero results are the reason for the exit. For example, if you perform a bit-by-bit AND operation on code 6 (binary 110) and each enum value, only LEAVE_CODE_SIG (binary 10) and LEAVE_CODE_NO_USERS (binary 100) get a non-zero result. The reasons for exiting, in this case, include a timeout and a signal triggering the exit.
| Enumerator              |                                                              |

| LEAVE_CODE_INIT         | 0: The initialization fails.                                 |
| LEAVE_CODE_SIG          | 2 (binary 10): The AgoraCoreService process receives the SIGINT signal.  |
| LEAVE_CODE_NO_USERS     | 4 (binary 100): The recording server automatically leaves the channel and stops recording because the channel has no user. |
| LEAVE_CODE_TIMER_CATCH  | 8 (binary 1000): Ignore it.                                                |
| LEAVE_CODE_CLIENT_LEAVE | 16 (binary 10000): The recording server calls the `leaveChannel` method to leave the channel. |

- `discontinueUtcMs`：Number. In most cases, this field is the same as `startUtcMs`. When the recording is interrupted, the Agora Cloud Recording service automatically resumes the recording and  triggers this event. In this case, the value of this field is the time (ms) in UTC when the last slice file stops.
- `mixedAllUser`:  Boolean. Whether the audio and video of all users are mixed into a single file.
  - `true`: All users are recorded in a single file.
  - `false`: Each user is recorded separately.

For example, you start a recording session and get this event notification in which `startUtcMs` is the starting time of slice file 1. Then, the recording session continues and records slice file 2 to slice file N, during which the recording service does not send this notification again. If an error occurs when recording slice file N + 1, you lose this file and the recording session stops. Agora Cloud Recording automatically resumes the recording and triggers this event again. In the event notification, `startUtcMs` is the time when slice file N + 2 starts, and `discontinueUtcMs` is the time when slice file N stops.
