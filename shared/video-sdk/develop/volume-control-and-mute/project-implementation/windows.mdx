### Adjust the playback volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```cpp
int volume = 50;
int uid = 123456;
// Set the local playback volume for all remote users 
m_rtcEngine->adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
// Set the local playback volume for a specific remote user. For example, user 123456
m_rtcEngine->adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid, volume)
```

### Adjust the recording volume
Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```cpp
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
int vol = 50;
m_rtcEngine->adjustRecordingSignalVolume(vol);
```

When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and the options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
* A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
* If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
* The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
* If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Mute and unmute users 

To mute or unmute the local audio stream, call `muteLocalAudioStream`:

    ```cpp
    // Stop publishing the local audio stream
    m_rtcEngine->muteLocalAudioStream(true);

    // Resume publishing the local audio stream
    m_rtcEngine->muteLocalAudioStream(false);
    ```

To mute or unmute a remote user, call `muteRemoteAudioStream` with the `uid` of the remote user:

    ```cpp
    // Stop subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    m_rtcEngine->muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, true);

    // Resume subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    m_rtcEngine->muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, false);
    ```

### Get volume information of users

<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback.  You use the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

```cpp
// Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
// their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
void CAudioVolumeEventHandler::onAudioVolumeIndication(const AudioVolumeInfo* speakers, unsigned int speakerNumber, int totalVolume){
}
```
