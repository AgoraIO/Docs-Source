This document lists the response status codes for Cloud Transcoding and Multi-bitrate streaming, along with their descriptions and recommended actions.

## Cloud Transcoding

When you call the RESTful API, you receive the following HTTP response status codes:

- If the HTTP status code is `2XX`, the request is successful.
- If the HTTP status code is not `2XX`, the request failed.

The following is a sample response for a failed request:

```json
// 400 Bad Request
{
  "message": "appid is invalid"
}
```

When using the Cloud Transcoding Service, you may receive status codes that indicate the service status. Refer to the following table to understand their meanings and take appropriate action:

| Status Code | Description | Suggested Actions |
|:-------------|:---------|:-------------------|
| `200 OK` | The request was successful. | No troubleshooting is required. |
| `201 Created` (Deprecated) | The task is already in progress. Do not use the same `builderToken` to start the task again. | No troubleshooting is required. |
| `202 Accepted` | The server has received the task request, but it does not mean that the execution is complete. | Query the execution status before proceeding to the next business operation. |
| `400 Bad Request` | <ul><li>The request syntax is incorrect.</li><li>The parameter value does not meet the requirements.</li><li>Your App ID does not have the cloud transcoding service enabled.</li></ul> | Investigate further based on the `message` field in the response body. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | The `Authorization` field for HTTP Basic Authentication is invalid. | Refer to Implementing HTTP [Basic Authentication](../authentication) or check your `Authorization` credentials. |
| `403 Forbidden` | The cloud transcoding service is not enabled for your App ID. | Contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) to activate it. |
| `404 Not Found` | Transcoder not found. | Use a backoff strategy to make a query request to confirm whether the transcoder is created successfully. |
| `409 Conflict` | A transcoder task with the same `instanceId` already exists. | If you want to create a new transcoder, delete the existing transcoder first. |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | The request rate exceeds the upper limit. | Wait for a while and try again. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Internal Agora server error. | Use a backoff strategy for query requests or contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). |
| `501 Not Implemented` | This method is not implemented. | No troubleshooting required. |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | The Agora server is temporarily overloaded or undergoing maintenance. | Use a backoff strategy for query requests or contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). |
| `504 Gateway Timeout` | <ul><li>An internal error occurred on the Agora server.</li><li>The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not get the request from the upstream server.</li><li>The upstream server is shut down.</li></ul> | Use a backoff strategy for query requests or contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). |

When using the Cloud Transcoding response status code for troubleshooting, keep the following in mind:

- If the request fails, do not perform any logical processing on the content of the `message` field in the response body. Instead, rely primarily on the status code for troubleshooting.  
- If the troubleshooting methods in the table do not resolve the issue, contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) with the values of the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` fields in the response header.  
- If you receive a `404` status code after a `Create` request has returned successfully and you have not called the `Delete` method, or if the transcoder remains idle beyond the `idleTimeout` parameter value in the request, use a backoff algorithm. Retry at increasing intervals of 5, 10, and 15 seconds to call the `Query` method for confirmation.  
- A `5XX` response status code usually indicates an issue in the serverâ€™s response process. Refer to the following recommended actions:  
    - Use a backoff strategy for query requests. Retry at increasing intervals of 5, 10, and 15 seconds to query the service status.  
    - Contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).  

## Multi-Bitrate

When you call the RESTful API, you receive the following HTTP response status codes:

- If the HTTP status code is `2XX`, the request is successful.
- If the HTTP status code is not `2XX`, the request failed.

The following is a sample response for a failed request:

```json
// 400 Bad Request
// may not have status or data
{
  "status": "string",
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "message": "string"
}
```
When using the Cloud Transcoding Multi-Bitrate service, you may receive status codes that indicate the service status. Refer to the following table to understand their meanings and take appropriate action:

| Status Code | Description                          | Suggested Actions |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------------|
| `200 OK` | The operation was successful. | No troubleshooting required. |
| `400 Bad Request` | The request is invalid. | Check whether the request parameters are legal. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | The authentication is invalid. | Check whether the `Authorization` parameters used for HTTP authentication are correct. See [Implementing HTTP Authentication](#) for details. |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource was not found. | Check that the `appId` and `codecId` parameter values are correct. |
| `415 Unsupported Media Type` | Unsupported media type. | Ensure that the `Content-Type` field in the request header is set to `application/json`. |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Requests are too frequent. | Wait for a while and try again. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Internal server error. | Retry a few times. |
