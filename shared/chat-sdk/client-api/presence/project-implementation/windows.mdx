### Subscribe to the presence status of one or more users

By default, you do not subscribe to any users. To subscribe to the presence statuses of the specified users, you can call `PresenceManager#SubscribePresences`.

Once the subscription succeeds, the `onSuccess` callback is triggered, notifying you about the current statuses of the specified users synchronously. Whenever the specified users update their presence statuses, the `IPresenceManagerDelegate#OnPresenceUpdated` callback is triggered, notifying you about the updated statuses asynchronously.

The following code sample shows how to subscribe to the presence status of one or more users:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.SubscribePresences(members, expiry, new ValueCallBack<List<Presence>>(
    onSuccess: (list) =>
    {
        foreach (var it in list)
        {
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
        Debug.Log($"SubscribePresences failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```

<div class="alert info"><ol><li>You can subscribe to a maximum of 100 users at each call. The total subscriptions of each user cannot exceed 3,000. Once the number of subscriptions exceed the limit, the subsequent subscriptions with longer durations succeed and replace the existing subscriptions with shorter durations.</li><li>The subscription duration can be a maximum of 30 days. When the subscription to a user expires, you need to subscribe to this user once again. If you subscribe to a user again before the current subscription expires, the duration is reset.</li></ol></div>


### Publish a custom presence status

You can call `PresenceManager#PublishPresence` to publish a custom status. Whenever your presence status updates, the users who subscribe to you receive the `IPresenceManagerDelegate#OnPresenceUpdated` callback.

The following code sample shows how to publish a custom status:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.PublishPresence(ext, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
        Debug.Log($"PublishPresence success.");
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
        Debug.Log($"PublishPresence failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```


### Listen for presence status updates

Refer to the following code sample to listen for presence status updates:

```csharp
PresenceM
// Adds the presence status listener.anagerDelegate presenceManagerDelegate = new PresenceManagerDelegate();
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.AddPresenceManagerDelegate(presenceManagerDelegate);

// Occurs when the presence statuses of the subscriptions update.
public interface IPresenceManagerDelegate
{
    void OnPresenceUpdated(List<Presence> presences);
}
```


### Unsubscribe from the presence status of one or more users

You can call `PresenceManager#UnsubscribePresences` to unsubscribe from the presence statuses of the specified users, as shown in the following code sample:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.UnsubscribePresences(mem_list, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
        Debug.Log($"UnsubscribePresences success.");
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
        Debug.Log($"UnsubscribePresences failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```


### Retrieve the list of subscriptions

You can call `PresenceManager#FetchSubscribedMembers` to retrieve the list of your subscriptions in a paginated list, as shown in the following code sample:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.FetchSubscribedMembers(pageNum, pageSize, new ValueCallBack<List<string>>(
    onSuccess: (list) =>
    {

    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
        Debug.Log($"SubscribePresences failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```

### Retrieve the presence status of one or more users

You can call `PresenceManager#FetchPresenceStatus` to retrieve the current presence statuses of the specified users without the need to subscribe to them, as shown in the following code sample:

```csharp
// members: The ID list of users whose presence status you retrieve.
// You can pass in up to 100 user IDs.
SDKClient.Instance.PresenceManager.FetchPresenceStatus(members, new ValueCallBack<List<Presence>>(
    onSuccess: (list) =>
    {
        foreach (var it in list)
        {
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) =>
    {
        Debug.Log($"FetchPresenceStatus failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
    }
));
```
