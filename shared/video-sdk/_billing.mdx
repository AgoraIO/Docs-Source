If your total service minutes do not exceed 10,000 minutes, the service is free of charge. After the 10,000 free-of-charge minutes are fully deducted, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> charges you for the additional service minutes. **The remaining free-of-charge minutes will be cleared at the end of each calendar month.** The 10,000 free-of-charge minutes policy does not apply to CDN live streaming. Using this service leads to immediate account freeze. If your app scenario involves CDN live streaming, we recommend adding a credit card to your account, making a payment, or signing a contract with <Vg k="COMPANY" />.

**The 10,000 free-of-charge minutes policy does not apply to the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> VSDK**.

### How does Agora calculate service minutes?

In <Vpd k="NAME"/>, service minutes are calculated either by the number of users or by the number of streams. Agora calculates service minutes **by the number of users**.

#### Approach 1: calculate by the number of users

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, the total service minutes = N \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* 10 = 50.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* 10 = 100.

In this approach, the service minutes purely depend on the number of the users in the channel, regardless of how many streams each user subscribes to.

#### Approach 2: calculate by the number of streams

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, and each user subscribes to all remote streams in the channel, the total service minutes = N \* (N-1) \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* (2-1) \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* (5-1) \* 10 = 200.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* (10-1) \* 10 = 900.

In this approach, if a user subscribes to multiple streams, every remote stream the user subscribes to is counted.

#### Difference between the two approaches

See the table below for the difference between the two approaches:

| Scenario                        | Service minutes by the number of users | Service minutes by the number of streams |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Two users talk for 10 minutes.  | 20 minutes                             | 20 minutes                               |
| Five users talk for 10 minutes. | 50 minutes                             | 200 minutes                              |
| 10 users talk for 10 minutes.   | 100 minutes                            | 900 minutes                              |

The difference between the two approaches become greater when more people join the channel.

### Calculation approach by Agora
