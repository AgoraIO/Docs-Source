In addition to the SDK that you integrate into the app client, Agora provides RESTful APIs for channel management. You use these APIs to manage users in the channel and query channel statistics at the app server.

This page provides detailed documentation for the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

### Domain

All requests are sent to the domain name: `api.agora.io`.

### Authorization

<Authorization/>

### Call frequency limit

For each Agora account (not each App ID), the maximum call frequency of each online channel statistics query API is 20 queries per second. The maximum call frequency of every other API is 10 queries per second. If you are frequency limited when calling the APIs, please see [How can I avoid being frequency limited when calling Agora Server RESTful APIs](/help/integration-issues/restful_api_call_frequency/) to optimize API call frequency.

### Response status codes

For a description of the response status codes returned when calling the Channel Management RESTful API, refer to [Response status codes](response-status-code).
