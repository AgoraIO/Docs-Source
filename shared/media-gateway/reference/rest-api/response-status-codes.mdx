After sending an HTTP request, the server will return a status code. Based on this status code, you can determine whether the request was successful and the reason for the possible failure:

- If the status code is `2XX`, the request was successful.
- If the status code is not `2XX`, the request has failed. Troubleshoot the problem based on the `message` field content in the response message body.

This page describes the status codes, the corresponding error reasons, and possible solutions.
