In addition to the Voice/Video SDK integrated into the app client, Agora provides RESTful APIs for channel management, with which you can manage users in the channel and query channel statistics at the app server.

This page provides detailed help for the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

## Basic information

This section provides basic information about the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

### Domain

All requests are sent to the domain name: `api.agora.io`. See [Ensure service reliability](#ensure-service-reliability) for alternate domain names.

### Data format

The `Content-Type` field in all HTTP request headers is `application/json`. All requests and responses are in JSON format. All request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.

### Authentication

The Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs only support HTTPS. Before sending HTTP requests, you must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the **Customer ID** and **Customer Secret** provided by Agora, and pass the credential to the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [HTTP authentication](/video-calling/reference/restful-authentication).

### Call frequency limit

For each Agora account (not each App ID), the call frequency of each <a href="#channelinfo">online channel statistics query</a > API is no more than 20 queries per second, and the call frequency of each other API is no more than 10 queries per second. If you are frequency limited when calling the APIs, please see [How can I avoid being frequency limited when calling Agora Server RESTful APIs](/help/integration-issues/restful_api_call_frequency/) to optimize API call frequency.

## Banning user privileges

### Creates a rule

Creates a rule of banning specified user privileges.

The user privileges (`privileges`) that can be banned include the following:

- `join_channel`: Joining a channel.

- `publish_audio`: Publishing audio.

- `publish_video`: Publishing video.

The banning rule works based on the following three fields: `cname`, `uid`, and `ip`.

 When you set `privileges` as `join_channel`, the rule works as follows:

 - If you set `ip`, but not `cname` or `uid`, then all users with this `ip` cannot join any channel in the app.
      
   Using `ip` as a filter field may incorrectly block users who should not be blocked, for example, in a scenario where multiple users share an IP address.

- If you set `cname`, but not `uid` or `ip`, then no one can join the channel specified by the `cname` field.

  Using `cname` as a filter field directly blocks the channel with the `cname`.

- If you set `uid`, but not `cname` or `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot join any channel in the app.

- If you set `cname` and `uid`, but not `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot join the channel specified by the `cname` field.

When you set `privileges` as `publish_audio` or `publish_video`, the rule works as follows:

- If you set `ip`, but not `cname` or `uid`, then the users with this `ip` cannot publish audio or video in any channel of the app.

- If you set `cname`, but not `uid` or `ip`, then no one can publish audio or video in the channel specified bythe `cname` field.

- If you set `uid`, but not `cname` or `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot publish audio or video inany channel of the app.

- If you set `cname` and `uid`, but not `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot publish audio or video inthe channel specified by the `cname` field.

A user who is kicked out of a channel (that is when you set `privileges` as `join_channel`) receives one of the following callbacks based on their platform:

- Android: The `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- iOS/macOS: The `connectionChangedToState` callback reports `AgoraConnectionChangedBannedByServer(3)`.
- Web (3.x): The `Client.on("client-banned")` callback.
- Web (4.x): The `Client.on("connection-state-change")` callback.
- Windows:The  `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- Electron: The `AgoraRtcEngine.on("connectionStateChanged")` callback reports `3`.
- Unity: The `OnConnectionStateChangedHandler` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- React Native: The `ConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `BannedByServer(3)`.
- Flutter: The `ConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `BannedByServer(3)`.
- Cocos Creator: The `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.

### Gets the user list

Gets the list of all users in a specified channel.

The return list differs with the channel profile as follows:

- In `COMMUNICATION` profile, this API returns the list of all users in the channel.
- In `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile, this API returns the list of all hosts and audience members in the channel.

<div><ul><li>Users in a channel must use the same channel profile; otherwise, the query results may be inaccurate.</li>
<li>You can synchronize the online channel statistics either by calling this API or by calling the <a href="#userstatus">Gets the user status</a> API. Compared with the <a href="#userstatus">Gets the user status</a> API, this API requires a lower call frequency and has a higher query efficiency. Therefore, Agora recommends using this API to query online channel statistics.</li></ul></div>.
