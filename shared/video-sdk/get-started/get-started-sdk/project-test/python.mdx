Follow these steps to test the demo code:

1. Create a file named `rtc.py` and paste the [complete source code](#complete-code) into this file.

1. Create a file named `main.py` in the same folder as `rtc.py` and copy the following code to the file:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from rtc import RtcEngine  # Import the RtcEngine class from rtc.py

    async def main():
        appid = "<Your app Id>"  # Replace with your Agora App ID
        channelId = "demo"  # Replace with your desired channel ID
        uid = "123"  # Replace with your unique user ID

        rtc_engine = RtcEngine(appid)
        channel = await rtc_engine.connect(channelId, uid)

        # Keep the script running to listen for events
        await asyncio.Event().wait()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

1. To specify the audio parameters, create a folder named `realtimeapi` and add a file `util.py` containing the following code:

    ```python
    # Number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)
    CHANNELS = 2

    # Sample rate for audio processing (in Hz)
    SAMPLE_RATE = 44100  # Common sample rates include 8000, 16000, 44100, 48000
    ```

1. To run the app, execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

    You see output similar to the following:

    ```
    Initialization result: 0
    LocalUserCB _on_audio_track_publish_start: 123456607304576 123456864576600
    ```

Congratulations! You have successfully connected to the Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ and joined a channel.
