6. **Initialization best practice**

      When the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> starts, it does the following:

            - Displays the available audio and video devices.

            - Enables the dual-stream mode.

            - Sets the audio profile.

            - Sets the video profile.

            - Sets fallback option for the remote video.

6. **Test the audio and video devices**:

      1. Select an audio device from the **Audio Devices** dropdown.

      1. Select a video device from the **Video Devices** dropdown.

      1. Click **Start Audio/Video device test**.

            You see the video from the selected video device is played in the local video container and the audio from the selected audio recording device is played on the playback device.

      1. To stop the test, click **Stop Test**.

1. **Join a channel**

    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
    Select a user role using the radio buttons. To connect to a channel, click **Join**, then grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
    To connect to a channel, click **Join**, then grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
    </ProductWrapper>

      You see the last-mile uplink and downlink network quality indicators updated periodically based on the result of the `network-quality` callback.

9. **Test In-call quality statistics**

      Click *Show Statistics*. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> prints the selected call-quality statistics in the debug console.

10. **Test Video stream fallback**

  Run another instance of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> on a test device and join the same  channel. <Vg k="VSDK" />
  applies the fallback strategy when any of the instances experiences network degradation.
