The TEN Framework (Transformative Extensions Network) is an open-source platform for building real-time multimodal AI agents. It enables you to create conversational applications that process voice, video, data streams, images, and text simultaneously. With TEN, you can rapidly develop sophisticated AI agents that think, listen, see, and interact naturally in real-time. 

The framework simplifies experimentation with large language models while providing reusable extensions for common functions. TEN supports diverse use cases including simultaneous interpretation, speech-to-text conversion, multilingual communication, audio-visual interaction, virtual companions, AI-generated meeting minutes, and language tutoring. 

By combining edge and cloud computing capabilities, TEN delivers an optimal balance of performance, privacy, and cost-efficiency for next-generation conversational AI applications.
