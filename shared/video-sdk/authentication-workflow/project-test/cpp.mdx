3. **Configure your project**:

    In `video-sdk-samples-windows/config.json`, update the following:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `rtcToken` - an empty string.
    * `serverUrl` - with the base URL for your token server.
        For example: `https://agora-token-service-production-yay.up.railway.app`.
    * `tokenExpiryTime` - with an integer denoting the number of seconds after which a token expires.

1.  **Run the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**:

    In Visual Studio, click **Local Windows Debugger**. A moment later you see the project running on your
    development device. If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

1. **Join a Channel**:

    Click **Join** to start a call. Now, you can see yourself on the device screen and talk to the remote user using your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

    Before `tokenExpiryTime` elapses you see the **Token is about to expire** prompt. When you click the message the
    app retrieves a new token and renews it with <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.
