This article introduces the new billing strategy for the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="VSDK"/> and the updated billing model in the Agora Console.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- Starting July 26, 2024, when you create a new general project in the Agora Console, all existing general projects under your account will automatically switch to the new billing model. If the switch fails, contact [`support@agora.io`](mailto:support@agora.io).
- If you don’t create a new general project after July 26, 2024, your projects will continue to use the old billing model. For details, see the [old billing strategy](pricing).
- If you’ve signed a sales contract with Agora, your billing will follow the terms in the contract.
</Admonition>

## Overview

Agora's real-time interaction services are billed monthly. At the end of each month, Agora calculates usage fees for all projects under the [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io).

Real-time interaction billing includes charges for the following service categories:

* **Basic services**: Audio and video subscription services for hosts and audience.
* **Value-added services**: Independently billed services such as screenshot uploads, co-host across channels, Agora Hybrid Cloud, and other media services.

The billing structure is shown below:

![Billing structure](/images/video-sdk/pricing-structure.jpg)

Agora settles the previous month’s charges on the **1st day of each month**. If you are on a postpaid billing cycle, deductions occur on the **6th day of the month**.

![Package usage workflow](/images/video-sdk/package-workflow.png)

## Basic services

To simplify billing, Agora converts basic service usage into a standard duration and settles fees accordingly. All audio and video subscriptions measured using this standard duration.

For calculation details and conversion coefficients, see:

* [Standard Duration](#standard-duration)
* [Collective Resolution](#collective-resolution)

Different stream resolutions contribute differently to the standard duration calculation.

### Subscription fees within a package

You can deduct basic service usage from available packages. If you don’t purchase a package, Agora provides a **default free package** that includes **10,000 standard minutes**.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
- After subscribing to a paid package, you will no longer receive the **10,000 free minutes**.
- Different packages support different advanced features. Purchase a package that fits your business needs. For details, see [Feature availability by plan](#feature-availability-by-plan).

### Additional usage

If your usage exceeds your subscribed plan, you can:

* Purchase a top-up package (recommended)
* Use **monthly postpaid billing**

#### Use top-up package

If you’ve purchased a top-up package, Agora will **automatically deduct** from it when your plan is exceeded.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- Available top-up packages: 25K, 250K, and 1,000K minutes  
- If purchased **before the 1st of the month**, the package can cover usage from the previous month  
- The system deducts usage **on the 6th of each month**.  
  - From the 1st to 6th: shows remaining balance **after last month’s settlement**  
  - From the 7th onward: shows balance **after current month’s deduction**
</Admonition>


#### Top-up package options

| Package Type       | Quota and Validity                                  | Price  | Discount |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |

#### Monthly postpaid billing

If your **actual usage** for the month **exceeds both the subscription and top-up packages**, the system will:

* Convert the overage into **standard minutes**
* Charge **¥7 per 1,000 standard minutes** at the time of settlement

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
- Ensure your account has sufficient balance to prevent service interruption due to non-payment.
- To switch to postpaid billing, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).
</Admonition>

### Billing example

User A purchases the **Ultimate Plan** on **August 15, 2024**, and enables **automatic renewal**.

* **August 15**: On purchase, User A pays
  `¥8,399 × (17 / 31) = ¥4,605.90` for the remaining days in August.
* **August 25**: The September plan is automatically renewed.
  `¥8,399` is deducted from the balance.
* **September 1**: August usage exceeds the plan by **100,000 minutes**.
  `100,000 ÷ 1,000 × ¥7 = ¥70` is automatically deducted from the account.

## Value-added service fees

In addition to basic service charges, <Vg k="VSDK"/> may incur additional costs when value-added services are used.

### Local screenshot upload

The local screenshot upload feature captures screenshots of video streams in a channel at set intervals and uploads them to a specified third-party cloud storage service.

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
For implementation details, see the [Local Screenshot Upload guide](..//advanced-features/screenshot-upload).
</ProductWrapper>

Agora charges local screenshot upload based on two metrics:

* **Screenshot fee**
* **QPS overage fee** (queries per second)

At the end of each month, Agora calculates:

* The **total number of screenshots** generated
* The **monthly peak QPS** if it exceeds the free quota

**Billing formula:**

```
Monthly fee = (Number of screenshots - free quota) × Screenshot unit price
            + (Monthly peak QPS - free QPS) × QPS overage unit price
```

#### Pricing

| Billing Type       | Unit Price               | Discount Policy                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Screenshot Fee     | 2 CNY per 10,000 images  | Includes a free quota of 10,000 images per month                                |
| QPS Overage Fee    | 10 CNY per QPS           | Includes 500 QPS per month: <br/> - ≤ 500 QPS: No charge <br/> - > 500 QPS: Charged based on monthly peak QPS |


#### Example

* **Example 1:**
  A project generates **910,000 screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **100**
  → Fee = (91 - 1) × 2 = **180 CNY**

* **Example 2:**
  A project generates **2.91 million screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **600**
  → Fee = (291 - 1) × 2 + (600 - 500) × 10 = **1580 CNY**

### Cross-channel media stream relay

The cross-channel media stream relay feature forwards a host’s media stream from the source channel to one or more target channels in real time.

<ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>

For implementation details, see the [Cross-channel media stream relay](../advanced-features/cross-channel-media-relay).

</ProductWrapper>

Agora charges based on **stream duration** and **forwarded video resolution**.

**Billing formula:**

```
Monthly fee = Total forwarding duration × Unit price (based on resolution)
```

#### Duration

* Calculated from the start to the end of the forwarding task.
* For multiple target channels, duration is multiplied by the number of targets.
* If the host stops publishing media but does not stop forwarding, billing continues based on **audio usage**.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- Forwarding to **N target channels** (N ≤ 6) multiplies the forwarding time by N.
- The resolution used for billing is based on the **forwarded stream**, not the subscriber’s aggregate resolution.
</Admonition>

#### Pricing

| Usage Type | Video Resolution            | Unit Price (CNY / 1,000 minutes) |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Audio      | -                           | 7 CNY                            |
| HD Video   | ≤ 1280 × 720                | 28 CNY                           |
| Full HD    | ≤ 1920 × 1080               | 63 CNY                           |
| 2K         | ≤ 2560 × 1440               | 112 CNY                          |
| 2K+        | > 2560 × 1440               | 252 CNY                          |


#### Example

* **Example 1:**
  
  Forwarding a 1280 × 720 video stream to **3 target channels** for **10 minutes**
  → Duration: 30 minutes
  → Fee: 30 × 28 / 1,000 = **0.84 CNY**

* **Example 2:**
  
  Forwarding **audio only** to **3 target channels** for **10 minutes**
  → Duration: 30 minutes
  → Fee: 30 × 7 / 1,000 = **0.21 CNY**

### Aggregate resolution

Aggregate resolution refers to the total resolution of all video streams subscribed to by a user.

**Example**:

A user subscribes to two streams:
    * 1280 × 720
    * 1920 × 1080

The aggregate resolution is: `1280 × 720 + 1920 × 1080 = 2,995,200`

Usage is billed as **2K video** based on this resolution.

| Subscription Type | Aggregate Resolution                            | Usage Tier    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Audio Only        | –                                               | Audio         |
| Video             | ≤ 921,600 (e.g., 1280 × 720)                    | HD Video      |
| Video             | 921,600 < res ≤ 2,073,600 (e.g., 1920 × 1080)   | Full HD Video |
| Video             | 2,073,600 < res ≤ 3,686,400 (e.g., 2560 × 1440) | 2K Video      |
| Video             | > 3,686,400                                     | 2K+ Video     |


### Standard duration calculation

Standard duration is used for unified billing and is calculated using the following formula:

**Standard Duration** = `Usage Time × Conversion Coefficient`

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="native-sdk" label="Native, Web, Framework Video SDK">

| Role                    | Audio | HD Video | Full HD | 2K | 2K+ |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | -- | --- |
| Host                  | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Interactive Live Audience | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Speed Live Audience       | 0.57  | 2        | 4.57    | 8  | 18  |

When actual usage is converted to standard duration, Agora calculates the total at the second level and rounds up the final result to the nearest whole number (minute).

**Example:**

* The host’s HD video usage is 60 seconds
  → Standard duration: 60 × 4 = **240 seconds**
* The audience’s audio usage is 360 seconds
  → Standard duration: 360 × 0.57 = **205.2 seconds**
* **Total:** 240 + 205.2 = 445.2 seconds = **7.42 minutes** → Final billed: **8 minutes**

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
This example is for illustrative purposes only. The actual billed duration is based on your project’s monthly report.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="miniapp-sdk" label="Mini Program Video SDK">

| Role                    | Audio | HD Video |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Host               | 1.43  | 4.29     |
| Interactive Live audience | 1.43  | 4.29     |

Agora calculates billing based on **standard duration**, which is derived from the actual usage in seconds. The total is then rounded **up to the nearest whole minute**.

**Example**: 

* The host's HD video usage is **60 seconds**. The HD video conversion factor is `4`, so the standard duration is:
  `60 × 4 = 240 seconds`

* An audience’s audio usage is **360 seconds**. The audio conversion factor is `0.57`, so the standard duration is:
  `360 × 0.57 = 205.2 seconds`

* The **total standard duration** is:
  `240 + 205.2 = 445.2 seconds` → `7.42 minutes`

* After rounding up, the final billing duration is:
  **8 minutes**
