 Get started with Agora's PSTN and SIP Gateway to connect phone calls to your Agora channels.
---

Agora's PSTN and SIP Gateway enables seamless integration between traditional telephony systems and Agora real-time communication channels. This service allows users to join Agora channels via phone calls, whether through inbound dialing with PIN authentication or outbound calls initiated by your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the PSTN and SIP Gateway APIs, you need to complete the following setup steps:

- **Contact Agora to provision your App ID** with the PSTN and SIP Gateway service. [Contact support](mailto:support@agora.io) to request access and provisioning.
- **Obtain an authorization header** to include in your API requests. Agora support will provide this during the provisioning process.

## Implementation

The PSTN and SIP Gateway provides the following REST API methods to integrate phone calling capabilities with your Agora channels:

### Core Call Management

- **[Inbound PSTN](/inbound-pstn)** - Generate a phone number and PIN for users to dial in and join an Agora channel
- **[Outbound PSTN](/outbound-pstn)** - Initiate outbound calls to connect users directly to an Agora channel
- **[Inbound SIP](/inbound-sip)** - Request a SIP address for routing calls to an Agora channel via SIP protocol

### Call Control

- **[End Call](/end-call)** - Terminate an active outbound call using the call ID
- **[Cancel Call](/cancel-call)** - Cancel a previous inbound call setup request

### Advanced Features

- **[Static PIN](/static-pin)** - Configure an external endpoint to validate static, non-expiring PINs for PSTN access

Each API method uses the same base endpoint (`https://sipcm.agora.io/v1/api/pstn`) with different `action` parameters to specify the desired operation. All requests require proper authorization headers and return JSON responses with relevant call details or error information.
