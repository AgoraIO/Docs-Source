    In `AgoraImplementationDlg.cpp` , locate the `setupVideoSDKEngine` method and replace `context.areaCode = AREA_CODE_NA;` with the following code:

    // Exclude Mainland China from the regions for connection
    context.areaCode = AREA_CODE_GLOB ^ AREA_CODE_CN
    ```
    The area codes support bitwise operation.
