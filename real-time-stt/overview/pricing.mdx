export const toc = [{}];

Agora calculates the billing for all projects under your Agora account on a monthly basis. Billing begins once you
enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

This page explains <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s billing policy for the <Vpd k="NAME"/> add-on.

<Admonition type="info">
Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.

## Transcription fee

When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for a channel, it transcribes the audio of the active hosts. When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for specific hosts, it only transcribes the audio of the specified hosts and ignores others. The <Vpd k="NAME"/> service excludes minutes when end users mute their audio and stop sending out audio streams. The audio stream is transcribed by the <Vpd k="NAME"/> engine and its duration is referred to as the transcription duration. Agora charges for the transcription duration of all or specified hosts in the channel. The unit price is as follows:

|Billing item |Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|:------------|:------------------:|:------------------------:|
|Transcription duration | Above 0         | 16.99             |

#### Example

After you enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>: 
- Host A speaks for 2 minutes and remains muted for 8 minutes.
- Host B speaks for 3 minutes and remains muted for 7 minutes.
- Host C speaks for 3 minutes and remains muted for 7 minutes.

In this case, the total transcription minutes are calculated as 2 (Host A) + 3 (Host B) + 3 (Host C) = 8 minutes. The period when hosts are muted and/or their time spent listening to others, is not counted towards the transcription duration. 

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
A standby fee of $0.99 per 1,000 minutes is charged if <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled and all hosts are muted. 
</Admonition >

## Language identification fee

<Vpd k="NAME"/> supports dynamic language detection when two or more languages are enabled for a channel or specific hosts. The Language Identification (LID) duration is the same as the transcription duration.

|Billing item|Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|:-------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|Language identification duration | Above 0        | 5.00            |

#### Example

- Suppose a channel exists for 10 minutes. There are three active, unmuted hosts, A, B, and C.
- If Spanish and Chinese LID is enabled for this channel at the start, the algorithm removes 8 minutes of muted audio for host A, 7 minutes for host B and 7 minutes for host C. Therefore, the transcription duration is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 minutes. The LID duration is also 8 minutes, being the sum of 2 minutes for host A, 3 minutes for host B, and 3 minutes for host C.
- If Spanish and Chinese LID is enabled for host A, then the transcription duration and LID duration are both 2 minutes.

Notes:
- The <Vpd k="NAME"/> transcription duration does not change if you enable more than one language.
- If only one language is set for a channel or a specified host, language detection does not start.

## Translation fee

When you enable Real-Time Translation (Beta) for a channel or a user, transcription is activated first. The transcription text is then translated to the target languages. The translation usage minutes are the same as the transcription usage minutes. The real-time transcription and translation usage and cost is shown in your monthly invoice. The unit price is as follows:

|Billing item | Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes/Target language|
|-------------|:------------------:|
|Translation  | 8.99             |

#### Example

After you enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>: 
- Host A speaks Russian for 2 minutes and remains muted for 8 minutes.
- Host B speaks French for 3 minutes and remains muted for 7 minutes.
- Host C speaks Russian for 3 minutes and remains muted for 7 minutes.
- Russian and French are translated to English.

In this case, the total transcription minutes are calculated as 2 (Host A) + 3 (Host B) + 3 (Host C) = 8 minutes. The translation minutes are the same as transcription minutes. Agora charges 8 minutes transcription fee and 8 minutes translation fee. 

Total cost = 8/1000*$16.99 + 8/1000*$8.99 = $0.136 + $0.072 = $0.208. 

If you translate Russian and French to English and German, the translation cost is multiplied by 2:

Total cost = 8/1000*$16.99 + 8/1000*$8.99*2 = $0.136 + $0.144 = $0.28.

## Free-of-charge duration

<Vpd k="NAME"/> and Real-Time Translation share 300 free-of-charge minutes for integration and testing purposes. 

- 1 minute of <Vpd k="NAME"/> equals 1 free-of-charge minute. 
- 1 minute of Real-Time Translation equals 8.99/16.99 free-of-charge minute.
