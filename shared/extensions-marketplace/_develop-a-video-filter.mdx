## Understand the tech

A video filter accesses video data when it is captured from the user's local device, modifies it, then plays the updated data to local and remote video channels.

A typical transmission pipeline consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, pre-processing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and play. In order to modify the voice or video data in the transmission pipeline, video extensions are inserted into either the pre-processing or post-processing procedure.


## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequisites />
* A project to develop in.

## Project setup

In order to integrate an extension into your project:

<ProjectSetup />

You are now ready to develop your extension.

## Create an video extension

<ProjectImplimentation />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have integrated the extension in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProjectTest />
