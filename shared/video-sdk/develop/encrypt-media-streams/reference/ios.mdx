* GitHub: [StreamEncryption](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/tree/main/iOS/APIExample/APIExample/Examples/Advanced/StreamEncryption)

### Integrate Encryption Library with Cocoapods
Follow the steps below to integrate the encryption library through Cocoapods:

1. Install CocoaPods. Refer to the installation guide on [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

1. In the terminal, open the project path and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

1. Open the Podfile, delete all content, and then enter the following content. Be sure to replace `Your App` with your Target name and `version` with the version of the SDK you need to integrate.
    ```shell
    # platform :ios, '9.0'
    target 'Your App' do
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS_Crypto', '~> version'
    end
    ```
1. Back in the terminal, run the `pod install` command to install the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="SDK"/>. After the SDK is successfully installed, the terminal will display `Pod installation complete!`, and you can see the `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

1. Open the `xcworkspace` file generated in Xcode.
