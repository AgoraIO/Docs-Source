## Introduction

A new version of Call Inspector was released on May 5, 2022. This new version has the following advantages over the previous version:
- Locating user-specific issues through call-specific issues is more efficient, especially for large-scale calls.
- Key quality metrics and events now offer receiver's and sender's views, making it convenient to locate exceptions.
- Agora's auto-diagnosis engine is fully integrated to reduce the time cost of inspecting a call through intuitive conclusions. All features related to the auto-diagnosis engine are currently in beta.

<div class="alert note"><li>To help you transition smoothly, the new Call Inspector provides a one-click switch on the user interface so you can go back to the old version. This option is available until the old version goes offline, which is scheduled for May 19, 2022.</li><li>For calls started before April 19, 2022, the new Call Inspector is for reference only because it has higher requirements for data.</li></div>

### Feature overview
