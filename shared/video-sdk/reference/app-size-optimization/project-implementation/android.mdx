#### Remove plugin when integrating manually
When integrating through the [Direct download](/en/sdks) link, manually delete the plug-in files that you do not need to use.

#### Remove plugins when integrating using Maven Central

When integrating the Android SDK through Maven Central, you can modify the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file to specify the dynamic libraries you need to integrate and exclude plug-ins you do not need to use. For details on the correspondence between each file in the Android SDK and the fields in `dependencies`, see [implementation fields](#implementation-fields) for details.

Refer to the following samples to include, all, none, or selected plugins.

* Use all plugins
    ```java
    dependencies {
     implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:4.0.1'
     implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-screen-sharing:4.0.1'
     // ...
    }
    ```

* Don't use any plugins

    ```java
    dependencies {
     implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:4.0.1'
     //...
    }
    ```

* Use selected plugins

    ```java
    dependencies {
     def agora_sdk_version = "4.3.0"
     // The following code contains $, so you must use double-quotes
     implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-rtc-basic:${agora_sdk_version}"
     implementation "io.agora.rtc:full-ains:${agora_sdk_version}"
     implementation "io.agora.rtc:audio-beauty:${agora_sdk_version}"
     //...
    }
    ```

## Dynamically link .so files

To reduce the size of the app's installation package, <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides the `mNativeLibPath` attribute in the `RtcEngineConfig` class to support dynamic loading of the required `.so` files. Refer to the following steps to implement this feature:

1. Download the latest version of the SDK and decompress it.
2. Integrate `agora-rtc-sdk.jar` into your project.
3. Upload the `.so` files for all architectures to your server and make sure that the app can download the `.so` files for the target architecture over the network.
4. When the app runs, it checks for the existence of an `.so` file. If the file is not found, it downloads the `.so` file and saves it to the private directory of the app.
5. When calling `create` to create and initialize an `RtcEngine` instance, set the `mNativeLibPath` config parameter to the app private directory where the `.so` file is located.
6. After calling `create` successfully, the SDK automatically loads the `.so` file from the specified path.
