### Adjust the playback volume
Call `adjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```java
int volume = 50;s
int uid = 123456;
// Set the local playback volume for all remote users 
mRtcEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
// Set the local playback volume for a specific remote user. For example, a user with uid=123
mRtcEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(uid, volume)
```

### Adjust the in-ear monitoring volume
During the process of audio capture, mixing, and playback, Agora enables you to adjust the in-ear monitoring volume. Enable and set the volume using `enableInEarMonitoring` and `setInEarMonitoringVolume`.

```java
// Enable in-ear monitoring
mRtcEngine.enableInEarMonitoring(true);
int volume = 50;
// Adjust in-ear monitoring volume
mRtcEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
```

### Adjust the recording volume
Call `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```java
ChannelMediaOptions options = new ChannelMediaOptions();
options.clientRoleType = Constants.CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER;
mRtcEngine.joinChannel(token, channelName, 1234, options);
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
int vol = 50;
mRtcEngine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(vol);
```

When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and the options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
* A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
* If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
* The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
* If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Mute and unmute users

To mute or unmute the local audio stream, call `muteLocalAudioStream`:

    ```java
    // Stop publishing the local audio stream
    mRtcEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(true);
    
    // Resume publishing the local audio stream
    mRtcEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(false);
    ```

To mute or unmute a remote user, call `muteRemoteAudioStream` with the `uid` of the remote user:

    ```java
    // Stop subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    mRtcEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, true);

    // Resume subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
    mRtcEngine.muteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, false);
    ```

### Get volume information of users

<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback. You use the `onAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

```java
private final IRtcEngineEventHandler mRtcEventHandler = new IRtcEngineEventHandler() 
{
    ...
      // Retrieve the user IDs of the three users with the highest instantaneous speaking volume,
      // their respective volumes, and determine whether the local user is speaking.
      @Override
      public void onAudioVolumeIndication(AudioVolumeInfo[] speakers, int totalVolume) {
    }
};
```

```java
// Enable the onAudioVolumeIndication callback
 mRtcEngine.enableAudioVolumeIndication(1000, 3, true);
