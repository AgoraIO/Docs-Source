    **MacOS 15 Sequoia beta system issue**

    When the app path (including the App name) contains non-English characters (such as Chinese characters), the compiled `Metal shader library` may not contain any methods, causing the app to crash. See [this article](../../help/other-issues/macos_15_beta) for the workaround.
