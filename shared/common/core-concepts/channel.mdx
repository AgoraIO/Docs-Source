<ProductWrapper product="signaling">

A data transfer management mechanism for passing data from one device to another. Any user who subscribes to or joins a channel can receive messages or events transmitted in that channel. Clients can subscribe to or join multiple channels at the same time.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the *channel name* to identify a channel. Users who specify the same *channel name* join a common channel and interact with each other. A channel is created when the first user joins. It ceases to exist when the last user leaves.

You create a channel by calling the methods for transmitting real-time data. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses different channels to transmit different types of data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel transmits audio or video data, while the <Vg k="MESS" /> channel transmits messaging or signaling data. The <Vg k="VSDK" /> and <Vg k="MESS" /> channels are independent of each other.

Additional components provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, such as On-Premise Recording and Cloud Recording, join the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel and provide real-time recording, transmission acceleration, media playback, and content moderation.
