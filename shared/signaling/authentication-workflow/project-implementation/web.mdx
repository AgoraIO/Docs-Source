### Login with a token

To log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> using an RTM token, fetch a token from your token server and pass it to the SDK by calling `login`. Refer to the following sample code:

```javascript
// Whether to enable the Token update loop
let started = true;

function sleep(time) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time));
}

function fetchToken(uid) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve) {
        axios
            .post(
                "http://<Your Host URL and port>/fetch_rtm_token",
                {
                    uid: uid,
                },
                {
                    headers: {
                        "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
                    },
                },
            )
            .then(function (response) {
                const token = response.data.token;
                resolve(token);
            })
            .catch(function (error) {
                console.log(error);
            });
    });
}

async function loginRTM() {
    // Your App ID
    const appID = "<Your App ID>";

    // Set RTM user ID
    const uid = "1234";

    // Get Token
    const token = await fetchToken(uid);

    // Initialize the client
    const client = new AgoraRTM.RTM(appID, uid);

    // Display connection status changes
    client.on('status', function (state, reason) {
        console.log("State changed To: " + state + " Reason: " + reason)
    });

    // Log in to the RTM system
    await client.login({ token });

    while (started) {
        // Update the Token every 30 seconds. This update frequency is for demonstration purposes; in production, it's recommended to update every hour.
        await sleep(30 * 1000);
        const newToken = await fetchToken(uid);
        await client.renewToken(newToken);

        let currentDate = new Date();
        let time = currentDate.getHours() + ":" + currentDate.getMinutes() + ":" + currentDate.getSeconds();
        console.log("Renew RTM token at " + time);
    }
}

loginRTM();
```

In the sample code:

- Replace `<Your App ID>` with your actual app ID. 
- Replace `<Your host URL and port>` with the actual host URL and port of your token server, for example, `10.123.123.123:8082`.


<Admonition title="Note">
- The user ID and app ID you use to initialize the <Vg k="SIG" /> client instance must be the same as the user ID and app ID you use on the token server to generate a token.
- When integrating the <Vpd k="SDK"/> into your app, ensure that the app certificate is properly configured. The app certificate serves as a key authentication mechanism between your app and Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ to ensure secure and reliable communication.

### Join a stream channel using a token

To join a stream channel using a token, fetch an **RTC** token from your token server and pass it to the SDK when you call `join`. For details, refer to the [API reference](../reference/api#channeljoinpropsag_platform).

### Token expiration and renewal

You configure the validity period of an RTM token in your token generator according to your business needs. The maximum validity period of a token is 24 hours. When an RTM token is about to expire, the `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` callback is triggered 30 seconds before the expiration time. When  you receive this callback, retrieve a fresh RTM token from your token server, and call `renewToken` to pass the new token to the SDK.

If the token expires, the SDK triggers the `linkState` callback with the following information:

- Current status `currentState`: `FAILED`
- The operation that triggers this state transition `operation`: `SERVER_REJECT`
- Reason for state change: `reason`: `Ticket expired`

In this scenario, log out of <Vpd k="NAME" /> using the `logout` method, retrieve a fresh token, and `login` again.

<Admonition type="info">

An alternative approach to handling token expiration through the `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` and `linkState` callbacks is to handle expiration proactively. Best practice is to update the token periodically to ensure seamless authentication and uninterrupted operation.
