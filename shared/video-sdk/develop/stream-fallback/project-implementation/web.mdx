1. Before joining a channel, call `AgoraRTCClient.enableDualStream` on the host to activate dual stream mode.

2. On the receiving end, call `AgoraRTCClient.setStreamFallbackOption` to configure the fallback behavior for receiving media streams and set the `fallbackType` parameter to one of the following values:

   - `1`: Ensures that only the host's video stream is received when the downlink network is weak.

   - `2`: Prioritizes the reception of the host's low resolution video stream in a weak network. If video display becomes impossible due to network conditions, only the host's audio stream is received.

   Additionally, when dual-stream mode is enabled on the host, the receiver can call the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method to specify receiving only the low resolution video stream by setting `streamType` to `1`.

4. During the session, the SDK triggers the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-fallback")` callback when the received stream switches between audio-and-video and audio-only modes, providing users with insights into the current stream reception status. Similarly, the `AgoraRTCClient.on("stream-type-changed")` callback is triggered when the received video stream switches between high and low resolutions.

In the following sample code, `client` refers to the local client object created using `AgoraRTC.createClient`, while the remote audio and video stream object is obtained through the `event.stream-added` event.

- **Host configuration**
  
    Enable dual stream mode

    ```javascript
    // Enable dual stream mode
    client.enableDualStream().then(() => {
      console.log("Enable dual stream success!")
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log(err)
    });
    ```

- **Receiver configuration**

    - In a weak network environment, first attempt to receive the low resolution stream; if video display is not feasible due to poor network conditions, only the audio stream is received.

        ```javascript
        // Set fallback option to low resolution video or audio only
        client.setStreamFallbackOption(remoteStream, 2)
        ```

    - To ensure call quality, you can also manually switch the subscribed video stream to low resolution.

        ```javascript
        // Manually switch to low resolution
        client.setRemoteVideoStreamType(remoteStream, 1);
        ```
