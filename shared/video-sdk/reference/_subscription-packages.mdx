A subscription package is a prepaid billing method. You can purchase a package in the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io/subscriptions/rtc-plans?tab=monthly) to cover usage for the current month.

This page explains how to purchase, and manage subscription and top-up packages.

### Purchase and upgrade

By default, a new account is assigned the Free package when the first project is created. You can upgrade at any time to the Starter, Pro, Business, or Business Plus. Higher-tier packages provide greater discounts and lower unit prices. To upgrade:

- Log in to [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/subscriptions/rtc-plans?tab=monthly).
- In the sidebar, click **Subscriptions**.
- Under **All Subscriptions**, click **RTC Prepaid Plans**.
- Select your package and click **Subscribe**.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- For non-contracted customers, all packages, except the Enterprise package can be purchased directly from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To upgrade to the Enterprise package, contact [Agora sales](mailto:sales@agora.io).
- You can upgrade sequentially or skip levels. For example, you may upgrade from Starter to Business Plus directly.
- Package upgrades take effect immediately and apply to the entire calender month. If you make multiple upgrades on the same day, only the last upgrade is applied.
- If your account has a negative balance, purchasing a prepaid package first charges your credit card for the outstanding balance, then for the package fee.

#### Upgrade rules

When you upgrade to a paid package, it becomes effective for the entire calender month, regardless of the purchase date. You receive the full monthly allocation of included minutes. The cost of the previous package is deducted from the new package price, so you only pay the difference. If you request an upgrade after 25th of the month, you may upgrade for the next month as well. 

### Renewal

By default, the subscription package renews automatically on the 25th of each month for the following month. Ensure your account has sufficient balance or enable auto-pay to avoid renewal failure. You can unsubscribe at any time to prevent renewal. See [Cancel subscription](#cancel-subscription).

If renewal fails:

- The system sends a notification and retries the renewal.
- If renewal still fails by the end of the month, the package downgrades to the Free package.
- To restore the previous package, see [Purchase and Upgrade](#purchase-and-upgrade).

### Downgrade

You can downgrade by selecting and purchasing a lower-tier package. A downgrade takes effect at the start of the next month if you request it by the 25th of the current month. You are charged for the new package when you request the downgrade.

You can downgrade only once per month.

- If your downgrade for the next month is successful, auto-renewal for the current package is not triggered on the 25th of the month.

- If a package is already active for the next month, you must wait until the 1st day of that month to initiate a downgrade for the following month.

#### Example

* **Requested on August 15**: The downgrade takes effect in September.
* **Requested on August 26**: Since a package is already active for September, you must wait until September 1 to initiate a downgrade for October.

### Cancel subscription

To cancel a prepaid package, downgrade to the Free package. Downgrade rules apply.

## Top-up package

A top-up package is a pay-as-you-go plan. You can purchase a top-up package from the [`Agora Console`](https://console.agora.io/subscriptions/rtc-plans?tab=top-up) to cover usage that exceeds your monthly package quota.

### Purchase

You can purchase multiple top-up packages. They are deducted in the order of purchase.

#### Example:

* Purchased 250,000-minutes top-up packages on **August 15** and **August 16**. On **September 1**, minutes consumed in August are deducted from the first package, then from the second.

### Validity

Each top-up package is valid for one year, starting from the purchase date to the end of the same month of the following year.

#### Example:

* Purchased on **August 15, 2025** → valid until **August 31, 2026**

Unused minutes expire after the validity period and cannot be carried forward.

### Cancel top-up package

Cancelling a top-up package is not supported.

## Free tier overage

For Free tier users, exceeding the included minutes and any purchased top-up minutes results in service suspension. Service resumes when you purchase additional top-up minutes or upgrade to a prepaid subscription package.
