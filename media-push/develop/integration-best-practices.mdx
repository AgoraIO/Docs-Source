import SwitchDomainName from '@docs/shared/common/_switch-domain-name.mdx';

To ensure reliability of Media Push, follow the advice on this page when integrating <Vg k="MPUSH" /> RESTful APIs.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to start using Media Push RESTful API:

- The scene of the channel is live, profile set to `BROADCASTING`
- Media Push is enabled
- To monitor Media Push events, enable [<Vg k="NCS_LONG" />](../../video-calling/core-functionality/receive-notifications) (optional).

## Check the limits

Check that your Peak Concurrent Worker (PCW), Queries Per Second (QPS), and the number of streams do not exceed the following limits set by Agora.

#### QPS

Agora sets the following QPS limits for the Media Push RESTful API:

|API       |QPS limit                                             |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
|Create    |Creating a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Delete    |Deleting a converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Update    |Updating a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|
|Get       |Getting the request rate of a specified converter is limited to 50 queries per second.|

When the QPS limit is exceeded, the status code `429` (Too Many Requests)
is returned. To extend the QPS limit, contact support@agora.io.

#### PCW

The PCW limit depends on your video stream resolution and region.

Resolutions:

- SD: Standard definition video, resolution ≤ 640 × 360
- HD: High definition video, resolution ≤ 1280 × 720 and > 640 × 360
- FHD: Full HD video, resolution ≤ 1920 × 1080 and > 1280 × 720

| Item         | Mainland China        | Europe                | America               | Asia (excluding mainland China) |
|:-------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------|
| RESTful API   | <ul><li>SD 300</li><li>HD 50</li><li>FHD 20</li></ul> | <ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>    |<ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>     | <ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>             |

To learn the details of the PCW limits for SDK API, or if you need to extend the RESTful API PCW limit, contact support@agora.io.

#### Number of streams

The upper limit of video attributes supported by Agora is as follows:

- Resolution 1920 × 1080
- Frame rate 30 FPS

The maximum number of supported streams is as follows:

| Service type | Mainland China        | Europe                | America               | Asia (excluding mainland China) |
|:-------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Media Push   | <ul><li>SD 300</li><li>HD 50</li><li>FHD 20</li></ul> | <ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>    |<ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>     | <ul><li>SD 20</li><li>HD 5</li><li>FHD - Contact support@agora.io to enable</li></ul>             |

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">If you need to upload multiple streams of different resolutions at the same time, make sure you meet the following requirements:<ul><li>The number of streams per resolution cannot exceed the corresponding limit for that resolution.</li><li>The total number of streams cannot exceed the limit set for the higher resolution. For example, if you upload both SD and HD streams in America, the total number of streams cannot exceed 20. If you upload HD and FHD, the total number cannot exceed 5.</li></ul></Admonition>

## Ensure the high availability of REST services

To ensure the high availability of REST services and prevent downtime caused by regional network faults, Agora provides
failover and domain name switch.

### Failover

Network failures and risks may be caused by cloud and network software, infrastructure, and other factors that Agora cannot control.
To provide the best possible user experience, Media Push provides high availability automatic task migration for failure recovery.
After a failure is confirmed, the Media Push task is migrated within 120 seconds. During this period, the task may be interrupted.

Consider whether you can accept the impact of high availability migration based on your own business characteristics, and decide whether to adopt higher quality assurance measures. For example, create multiple Media Push tasks for critical scenes. Alternatively, you can make periodic API calls and monitor notifications to get the latest task status, then create a new task with a different UID once you confirm the task status is unhealthy.

### Multiple Media Push tasks (RTMP Converters)

If you need a more reliable solution than fault recovery, you can use a multiple Media Push task strategy. You can choose the following two ways to implement it:

1.  Start the main push task and multiple backup tasks at the same time.
    Set a different CDN address for each Media Push task. When the main
    Media Push task fails, the CDN audience can switch to the backup CDN
    address in time.

2.  If the CDN vendor you use supports the feature of pushing several
    streams to the same CDN address with different priorities,
    create a Media Push task No. 1 to the CDN with priority 1
    (`<rtmp://xxx/xxx/xxx>? priority=1`). If task 1 fails, create
    task 2 with priority is 2. In this case, task 1 is ignored by the CDN.
    The priority fields of different CDNs are different. Check with the CDN vendor
    whether the priority function is supported and what the name of the
    priority field is.

For use cases with higher quality requirements, requesting multiple Media Push tasks with different tagging enables isolated resources for these tasks and raises the success rate. Media Push supports room-level isolation for tasks. For example, if there is a task with `"name":"my-task"` in the original request, you can add a suffix to the `name` parameter to realize isolation at the computer room level. Use `"name":"my-task-agora-isolate-1"` and `"name":"my-task-agora-isolate-2"` to start additional tasks. Note that:

* If resources are insufficient, then tasks started later fails.
* Media Push supports up to three-way isolation, That is, `my-taskagora-isolate1`, `my-task-agoraisolate-2`, and `my-taskagora-isolate-3` can be separated.

## Create a Media Push RTMP Converter

When creating a converter with a `create` call, pay attention to the following:

- Create the converter by region parameter:
    - The region you set must be in the same area as your CDN origin station. For example, if your CDN origin is located in the US, set region to `na`.
    - Pass the region value in lowercase.
- Agora recommends that you assign a string value to the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header. The Agora server returns an `X-Custom-request-ID` field in the response header for troubleshooting purposes.
- Set UID or account as the user name for the converter. Do not set these two fields at the same time. Ensure that each converter has a unique user name within the channel.
- To avoid repeated media streaming due to repeated creation of multiple converters, it is recommended to use the name field to manage converters under a specific project.    At the same time, converters with the same names cannot exist in a project. If you attempt to create a converter with the same name, you receive the `409` (Conflict) status code.
- Agora recommends that you assign the name using a combination of the channel name and a converter property. For example, `show68_horizontal` and `show68_vertical` would represent a horizontal and a vertical layout respectively.
- `audioOption` and `videoOptions` are set as follows for audio only or video only scenarios:
    - In a video only scenario, you do not need to set `audioOptions` and its related fields.
    - In an audio-only scenario, you do not need to set `videoOptions` and its related fields by default. For special cases, see [Output SEI in audio-only scenarios](#output-sei-in-audio-only-scenarios).
    - In audio plus video scenarios, `videoOptions` and `audioOptions` are required and cannot be left blank. If you do not need to configure `audioOptions` set it to `null`.

- Set an appropriate value for `idleTimeout`. The default value of 300 seconds is recommended. It means that the converter is automatically destroyed, 300 seconds after all subscribers leave the channel.

### Output SEI in audio-only scenarios

In an audio-only scenario, by default, you do not need to set `videoOptions` and its related fields. However, if you need to carry additional user information, such as volume, you can set SEI information with the `seiOptions` field in `videoOptions`.

If you want to output SEI information in Metadata or DataStream type carried by the user in an audio-only scenario and avoid video transcoding fees, follow these steps:

1. Pass the SEI information to be output in `videoOptions.seiOptions`.
1. Ensure that the `width` and `height` in `videoOptions.canvas` are set to `16` to avoid video transcoding fees.
1. Pass the UID of the user who carries the SEI information in `rtcStreamUid` field in `videoOptions.layout`.

## Update RTMP converter

When updating a specified converter with an `Update` call, pay attention
to the following:

When you use the query parameter sequence to update the same converter
multiple times, ensure that the sequence value increases. Media Push updates the converter according to the latest update request, that is, the maximum sequence number.

The Update API does not support the following configuration parameters:

- `name`
- `idleTimeOut`
- `transcodeOptions.rtcChannel`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.codecProfile`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.sampleRate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.bitrate`
- `transcodeOptions.audioOptions.audioChannels`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codec`
- `transcodeOptions.videoOptions.codecProfile`

## Troubleshooting and recommended measures

### Retry with retreat strategy

If you receive `404`, `429`, or `5xx` error codes, use a backoff strategy. For example, wait 5-6 seconds, 10-11 seconds, or 15-16 seconds and try again. If you get three consecutive `404` or `5xx` error codes, or if the `state` field in the response to checking the status of a Media Push task says `failed`, it means that the Media Push task has failed. To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1.  Check whether the CDN address is correct.
2.  If the CDN address is correct, destroy the current converter and create a new one.

### Troubleshooting by error code

- If the status code is 200, the request is successful.
- If the status code is not `200`, the request has failed. See the error message in the response body for clarification.

|Status code               |Possible error message |Possible reason of failure |Measures to take|
|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:--------|:----------|
|`400` Bad Request         |Invalid parameter: `rtmpUrl`. Replace and retry. Invalid parameter: `idleTimeout`. Replace and retry.	|Wrong parameters. Check by referring to the `reason` field in the HTTP response body.|
