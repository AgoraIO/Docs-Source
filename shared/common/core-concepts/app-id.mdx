### App ID

The App ID is a unique key generated by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> to identify each project and provide billing and other statistical data services. The App ID is critical for connecting users within your app. It is used to initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, and as one of the required keys to create authentication tokens for secure communication. Retrieve the App ID for your project using the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Agora Console</Link>.

App IDs are stored on the front-end client and do not provide access control. Projects using only an App ID allow any user with the App ID to join. For access control, especially in production environments, choose the **App ID + Token** mechanism for user authentication when creating a new project. Without authentication tokens, your environment is open to anyone with access to your App ID.
