Data encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel communicate with each other. This ensures that
potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every  use
case requires data encryption, <Vpd k="NAME"/> provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality
during transmission.

This page shows you how to integrate built-in data encryption into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the call flow for the data  encryption:

![Encrypt data ](/images/signaling/data-encryption.svg)

All users in a channel must use the same encryption configuration to initiate `agoraEngine` and enable encryption before joining a channel. If you donâ€™t have the correct configuration, you cannot decrypt channel content. Best practice is that your authentication system generates a new key and salt regularly.

<Vpd k="NAME"/> provides security for user applications in the following ways:

- **Transport layer encryption**: for data transmission between your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/>.
- **Message encryption**: each message is protected with end-to-end AES_256_GCM encryption protection.
- **Token authorization** - time-based access access control strategy.

To ensure secure communication, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses the same SSL [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) and [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to encrypt and
decrypt data in the channel. You use the key and salt to create an encryption configuration. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND"/> uses the encryption configuration to encrypt a stream and sends it to remote users. When the remote user receives
the encrypted data stream, the remote <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> decrypts the data stream using the same salt and key.

If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> must be highly secure, or meet security compliance standards like HIPAA or SOC 2
type 2, use message-level encryption. For a higher levels combine TLS encryption with end-to-end AES encryption.

## Prerequisites

To follow this page, you must have:

- Setup the [<Vg k="MESS"/> SDK sample project](/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk#project-setup).

* Installed the latest version of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)


## Implement <Vg k="COMPANY" /> data stream encryption

To implement data encryption, do the following:

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

<ProjectTest />

Communication between your test devices is end-to-end encrypted. This prevents data from being read or secretly modified by anyone other than the true sender and recipient.
