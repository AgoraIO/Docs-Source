You use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="CP"/> to ensure reliable connectivity for your users when they connect from an environment with a restricted network.

## Understand the tech

To accommodate your end users’ firewall settings and business needs, <Vg k="CP"/> offers the following operating modes:

-   **Automatic**

    The default setting. In Automatic mode, <Vg k="VSDK" /> first attempts a direct connection to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />; if the attempt fails, <Vg k="VSDK" /> automatically falls back and sends media securely on TCP/TLS 443. This is best practice when you are not sure if your end users are
    behind a firewall. Sending media over TCP/TLS 443 may not have as high quality UDP. However, a connection on TCP/TLS 443 works through most firewalls.

-   **Force UDP**

    <Vg k="VSDK" /> securely sends media over UDP only. Your end users’ firewall must be configured to trust a list of <Link to = "../../{{product.PATH}}/reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">allowed IP address</Link>.
    This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and require media with the highest possible quality. This mode does not support pushing streams to the CDN or relaying streams across
    channels.

-   **Force TCP**

    <Vg k="VSDK" /> securely sends media over TCP/TLS 443 only. This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and the firewall’s security policies only allow media to flow through
    TCP/TLS 443. In some cases the firewall might trust any traffic over TCP/TLS 443. However, in many cases the firewall is configured to trust only a specific range of IP addresses sending traffic over TCP/TLS 443. In this case, your end user’s firewall must be
    configured to trust a list of <Link to = "../../{{product.PATH}}/reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">allowed IP address</Link>. Media quality might be impacted if network conditions degrade.

The following figure shows the <Vg k="CP"/> workflow:

![cloud proxy](/images/video-sdk/cloud-proxy.svg)

The steps you need to implement in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> are:

1.  Before connecting to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, set <Vg k="VSDK" /> to request a connection to <Vg k="CP"/>.

2.  When the request succeeds, <Vg k="CP"/> sends back the proxy information.

3.  <Vg k="VSDK" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards this data to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

4.  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards it to <Vg k="VSDK" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

-   Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

-   Configured your firewall to allow communication through the <Vg k="CP"/> <Link to = "../../{{product.PATH}}/reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">allowed IP address</Link>.


## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to use <Vg k="CP"/> feature in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

1.  **Enable <Vg k="CP"/>**:

    -   If your estimated Peak Concurrent Users (PCU) during a month exceeds 200, and you want to use either Force UDP or Force TCP
        mode, contact [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Customer Support](mailto:support@agora.io) to activate <Vg k="CP"/>.

    -   If your estimated PCU during a month is 200 or less:

        1.  In [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/), click the **Project Management** icon on the left.

        2.  In **Project Management**, click **Config** for the project you want to enable <Vg k="CP"/> for.

        3.  Under **Features**, find **<Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes)**, then click **Enable**.

        4.  Read the **Enable Cloud Proxy** information carefully. Check the box showing you have read the page, then click
            **Enable**.

            Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/> within 24 hours.

        5.  Check the **Status** of <Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes). Once you see **Enabled**, Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/>.

            After activation, you can deactivate <Vg k="CP"/> at any time using [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/). <Vg k="CP"/> is deactivated immediately.

2.  **Open your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**:

    In your IDE, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement communication using <Vg k="CP"/>

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement <Vg k="CP"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement/>

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="CP"/> in your <Vg k="CLIENT" />:

1.  [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2.  In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update *App ID*, *Channel*, and *Token* with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
