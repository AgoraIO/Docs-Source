## v2.16.59

v2.16.59 was released on January 19, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This version deprecates the existing London data center (`Region.gb-lon`) in the Whiteboard Data Center and introduces a new data center in Frankfurt, Europe (`Region.eu`), whose service covers Europe. If you have set `Region.gb-lon` in the previous version, please switch to` Region.eu` after upgrading to this version and enable this data center in Agora Console.

#### New features

**PPT Volume Control**

This version adds the `getSlideVolume` and `updateSlideVolume `methods to retrieve and update the volume of audio in PPT slides.

**PPT URL Intercept and Replacement**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds a new configuration option, `enableSlideInterrupterAPI`, to enable intercepting and replacing URLs of PPT resources. This feature can be used to encrypt PPT resources uploaded by users and protect their privacy.
Once enabled, the PPT file URL intercept and replacement feature can be implemented by calling `WhiteSdk.setSlideListener(SlideListener)`.

**PPT Rendering Notification**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds the `whiteSlideAppParams` configuration option for displaying configurations related to [@netless/app-slide](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app/tree/master/packages/app-slide) rendering. Currently, it supports configuring `WhiteSlideAppParams.showRenderError` to show or hide rendering error notifications.

**Custom API Server Domain**

`WhiteSdkConfiguration` adds the `apiHosts` configuration option to configure a list of API server domains for the whiteboard, which can be used for server proxy implementation.

**Custom Module Source**

`RoomParams` adds the `modulesOrigin` configuration option to configure the address for requesting whiteboard module data.

**Document Operation Events**

This release adds the `dispatchDocsEvent` method to send events to the inserted PDF/PPTX documents in the whiteboard, allowing control over document page flipping, page navigation, and slide animation playback.

#### Improvements

**Optimized Document Insertion**

This version optimizes the process of converting and inserting PPT files into the whiteboard using the new document conversion service. You can use the new `createSlideApp` method to construct a `WindowAppParam` object, which includes `ProjectorAttributes` and `ProjectorOptions`, corresponding to the parameters passed when opening the document, see `addApp`.

**Window Fullscreen**

A new property, `WindowParams.fullscreen`, is added to control whether the window is displayed in fullscreen mode.

## v2.16.42

v2.16.42 was released on December 2, 2022.

#### New features

This release adds new features for the following whiteboard tools:

- Pencil: Adds support for drawing dotted lines by adding `dottedLine: true` in `room.memberState`.
- Text: Adds support for directly selecting and editing whiteboard text by adding `textCanSelectText: true` in `room.memberState`.

In addition, this release adds a pencil eraser tool to erase any part of a pencil stroke.

**2. Floatbar**

This release adds the floatbar feature. The floatbar pops up when selecting any whiteboard item, which enables users to
easily edit these whiteboard items. For example, when selecting a stroke, the floatbar enables the user to remove it or
change its color. When selecting text, the floatbar enables the user to adjust its style or change its typeface.

Call the `setUsingFloatBar` method to enable the floatbar.

**3. Remove whiteboard pages**

This release adds the `removePage` method to delete a specified whiteboard page.

**4. Request slide log**

This release adds the `requestSlideLog` method in the `WhiteSdk` class to request the slide log on the client.
This facilitates debugging slide-related issues.

**5. Player callbacks**

To facilitate listening to the state changes of `Player`, this release adds `addPlayerListener` and `removePlayerListener`
methods to add and remove player callbacks.

#### Improvements

This release optimizes the audio playback control in PPT files. You can now pause or resume audio mixing or playback in
dynamic PPT files with the `pauseAudioMixing` and `resumeAudioMixing` methods.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- Under multi-window mode, no callback was received when the `sceneState` changed.
- The creation of the whiteboard app sometimes failed after reconnection.
- When creating the whiteboard app, synchronizing the initial height and width sometimes failed.
- Switching the readable/writable state sometimes caused the configuration to be lost in the `disableCameraTransform` of `mainView`.

## v2.16.21

v2.16.21 was released on September 13, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**SDK integration changes**

As of v2.16.0, Agora only updates the `netless-io:whiteboard-android` GitHub repository; Agora no longer maintains the `duty-os:white-sdk-android` GitHub repository. When integrating the SDK v2.16.0 or later with JitPack, you need to modify the `implementation` field under `dependencies` in the `/Gradle Scripts/build.gradle(Module: <projectname>.app)` file as follows:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.netless-io:whiteboard-android:<version>'
}
```

For details, see [Get the SDK](/interactive-whiteboard/get-started/get-started-sdk#get-the-whiteboard-sdk).

#### New features

**1. Inserting text**

This release adds the `insertText` method for inserting text at a specified position.

**2. Disabling the stroke effect**

This release adds the `setDisableNewPencilStroke` method to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to enable or disable the stroke effect of the pencil. The default value of the `disableNewPencilStroke` parameter in this method is `true`, and the SDK enables the stroke effect immediately when you call `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil. To disable the stroke effect after setting `setDisableNewPencil(false)`, you can call `setDisableNewPencilStroke(true)`.

This release also adds the `isDisableNewPencilStroke` method to `WhiteSdkConfiguration` to get whether the stroke effect of the new pencil is disabled.

**3. Getting the scene information**

adds the `getScene` method to the `Displayer` class, which supports using the scene path to get the information about a specified scene.

#### Improvements

This release provides the following improvements:

- Adds tween animation for the new pencil. This allows the SDK to automatically insert frames between keyframes when a user draws or writes with the new pencil, so that remote users see a smoother drawing process. To experience this improvement, ensure that you have called `setDisableNewPencil(false)` to enable the new pencil.
- Optimizes the writing performance on Android browsers.
- Optimizes the reconnecting mechanism in weak network environment to reduce unnecessary reconnections.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasionally, the contents on the whiteboard appeared shifted and overshadowed after users zoomed or moved their view.
- Occasionally, users could not switch the pages of a dynamic PPT slide after an SDK reconnection.
- The contents on the whiteboard occasionally were not fully displayed when users joined a whiteboard room that already had. 
- A memory leak sometimes occurred after an SDK reconnection.
- An error sometimes occurred when calling `setWritable` repeatedly.
- When a user switched to read-only mode, then switched back to read-write mode and wrote, remote users saw that user's cursor as fixed.
