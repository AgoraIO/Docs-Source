<Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some cases, users want to modify the captured audio to add sound effects, mix in a pre-recorded audio, or change the voice quality before the audio is published. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides several options that enable you to add sound effects, mix in pre-recorded audio, apply voice effects and set the audio route. This page shows you how to implement these features in your channel.

## Understand the tech

Using <Vpd k="SDK" /> you can implement the following audio features:

* **Audio effects and audio mixing**

    Some real-time communication applications, such as online gaming and karaoke are built around audio mixing features. Playing a sound effect at the appropriate time or mixing background music with microphone audio is essential to such applications. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides APIs that enable you to implement:

    * _Audio Effects_: Play audios with a short duration. For example, applause, cheers, and gunshots. You can play multiple audio effects at the same time.

    * _Audio Mixing_: Play longer music file, such as background music. Using audio mixing, you can play only one file at a time.


* **Voice effects**

    Voice modifying effects such as chat beautifier, singing beautifier, and voice changer are gaining popularity in social interaction and entertainment scenarios. To help you quickly integrate voice effects into your project, <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides pre-configured effects. You can choose from the following types of effects:

    * _Preset voice beautifiers_: Chat beautifier, singing beautifier, and timbre transformation.

    * _Preset audio effects_: Voice changer, style transformation, room acoustics, and pitch correction.

    * _Preset voice conversion_: Changes the original voice to make it unrecognizable.

    * _Voice formant modification_: Changes the voice timbre by adjusting the formant ratio.

    * _Customized audio effects_: Controls the voice pitch, equalization, and reverberation.

* **Audio route**

    When audio is played back on a device, it can be routed to one of several hardware components such as the earpiece, headphones, speakerphone, or Bluetooth devices. The audio route is changed by the device user when they add or remove an external device. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to change the [default audio route](#default-audio-routes) or temporarily set an audio route.
