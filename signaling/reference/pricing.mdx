This page explains how <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your monthly bill for <Vg k="SIG"/>.

If you have already signed a contract with <Vg k="COMPANY" />, the billing terms and conditions within that contract take precedence.

## <Vg k="SIG"/> pricing

The unit prices are as follows:

| Highest number of DAUs for the month | Pricing, US$/1,000 DAUs |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| ≤ 1,000                              | 0                      |
| &gt; 1,000                           | 14.50                  |

## Cost calculation

Billing for <Vg k="SIG"/> begins once you implement the signaling
functionality using <Vg k="MESS_SDK"/> and occurs monthly.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your monthly pricing by adding up the highest number of
**daily active users (DAUs)** for the month of each <Vg k="SIG" /> project in your
[<Vg k="CONSOLE" /> developer account](https://console.agora.io/), subtracting the 1,000 free DAUs,
and multiplying by unit pricing.

The basic formula is shown here:

**Monthly cost** = (**total DAUs in all projects** - **1000 free DAUs**) / 1,000 × **unit pricing**

## Examples

This section illustrates how <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates the cost for <Vg k="SIG"/>.

### One project

Suppose you are using <Vg k="SIG"/> and the highest number of DAUs for the month is 9,000.
Because the first 1,000 in the highest number of DAUs for the month are free of charge,
the number of DAUs used to calculate the monthly billing is 8,000.
Therefore, the monthly billing for <Vg k="SIG" /> is 8,000 (DAUs) / 1,000 × $14.50 = $116.

### Two projects

Suppose you are using <Vg k="SIG"/> in project A and project B. The highest number of DAUs for the
month in project A is 9,000, and the highest number of DAUs for the month in project B is 5,000.
Because the first 1,000 in the highest number of DAUs for the month are free of charge,
the number of DAUs used to calculate the monthly billing is 9,000 + 5,000 - 1,000 = 13,000.
Therefore, the monthly billing for <Vg k="SIG" /> is 13,000 (DAUs) / 1,000 × $14.50 = $188.5.
