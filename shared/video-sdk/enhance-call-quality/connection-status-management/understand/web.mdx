![Disconnection Connection](/images/video-sdk/connection-state-web.png)

In the diagram:

- **T0**: The <Vpd k="SDK" /> receives a `Client.join` request from `UID1`.

- **T1**: `UID1` successfully joins the channel. `UID1` receives `AgoraRTCClient.on("connection-state-change")` callback reporting "CONNECTING" during joining channel and "CONNECTED" after joining.

- **T2**: Due to the transmission delay between networks, `UID2` observes a delay of about 100 milliseconds for `UID1` to join the channel, and at this point `UID2` receives a `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-joined")` callback.

- **T3**: At some point `UID 1` calls `AgoraRTCClient.publish` to publish the local track.

- **T4**: `UID 2` receives the `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-published")` callback indicating that `UID 1` has published the track. `UID 2` can subscribe to `UID 1`'s track by calling `AgoraRTCClient.subscribe` method.

- **T5**: If the `UID 1` network is interrupted during the communication process, the SDK automatically opens the disconnection and reconnection mechanism.

- **T6**: The SDK triggers `AgoraRTCClient.on("connection-state-change")` callback to report "RECONNECTING" during automatic reconnection.

- **T7**:  If the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server does not receive the audio/video packet from `UID 1` for 10 consecutive seconds, the server determines that `UID 1` no longer publishes audio/video, and `UID 2` will receive `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-unpublished")` callback.

- **T8**: If the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server does not receive a heartbeat packet from `UID 1` for 20 consecutive seconds, the server determines that `UID 1` is offline, and `UID 2` will receive the `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-left")` callback.

- **T9**: After successfully re-establishing the connection, `UID 1` receives the `AgoraRTCClient.on("connection-state-change")` callback reporting as "CONNECTED".

- **T10**: `UID 2` receives the `AgoraRTCClient.on("user-joined")` callback again.
