<PlatformWrapper platform="unity">

During the run time of the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat SDK, the error codes and error messages might be returned in the following ways:

- The return value when a method call fails.
- The error code reported through the `onError` callback.

For example, when a user registration request fails because the username already exists, the `onError` callback returns the following error code and error message:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.Login(username, passwd,
            callback: new CallBack(
                onSuccess: () =>
                {
                },
                onError: (code, desc) =>
                {
                    // code: 203
                    // desc: USER_ALREADY_EXIST
                }
            )
        );
```

A user attempts to destroy a message thread (only the owner or administrators of the group where the thread resides can destroy the thread). |
| 213 | `USER_BIND_ANOTHER_DEVICE` | The user has logged in to another device.

| 220        | `USER_DEVICE_CHANGED`             |  If you set that the login device takes precedence, a login attempt on another device triggers this error to notify that the login device is detected as irregular.|
| 221        | `USER_NOT_FRIEND`                 |  If you set that only contacts can send messages to you in the console, the SDK returns this error when strangers attempt to send messages.        |
