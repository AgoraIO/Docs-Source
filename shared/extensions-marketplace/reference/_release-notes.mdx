## AI Noise Suppression

### v1.1.0

**Compatibility changes**

After upgrading to v1.1.0, take note of the following changes regarding the AI Noise Suppression extension:

- The extension must be used together with the Agora Web SDK v4.15.0 or later.
- The extension has Wasm dependencies only. Because JS dependencies are removed, you need to publish the Wasm files located in the `node_modules/agora-extension-ai-denoiser/external` directory again. If you have enabled the Content Security Policy (CSP), you need to modify the CSP configuration. See [Use AI Noise Suppression extension](/interactive-live-streaming/develop/ai-noise-suppression) for details.
- The audio data is dumped in PCM format instead of WAV format.
- To adjust the intensity of noise suppression, Agora recommends calling `setLevel` instead of other APIs.

**New features**

This release adds the following APIs and parameter:

- `checkCompatibility`: Checks whether the AI Noise Suppression extension is supported on the current browser.
- `setMode`: Sets the noise suppression mode as AI noise suppression or stationary noise suppression.
- `setLevel`: Sets the AI noise suppression level.
- `elapsedTime` in `onoverload`: This callback parameter reports the time (ms) the extension needs to process one audio frame.

For API details, see [Use AI Noise Suppression extension](/interactive-live-streaming/develop/ai-noise-suppression).

**Improvement**

This release improves the calculation performance of the AI-powered noise suppression algorithm.
