### Implement the user interface

This section guides you through the necessary UI changes in the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> project interface to implement call quality features.

You need the following elements in the UI:

* A button to start and stop the echo test.
* A button to switch stream Quality
* A label to display network quality.

To add these elements to the UI, open `App.tsx` and add the following lines in `const App = () => {`:

```ts
const [quality, setQuality] = useState(''); // Indicates network quality
```

To render the label, add the following lines after `Leave </Text></View>`:

```ts
<View style={styles.btnContainer}>
    <Text> Network Quality: {quality}</Text>
</View>
<View style={styles.btnContainer}>
    <Text onPress={echoTest} style={styles.button}>
        Echo Test
    </Text>
</View>
```

### Handle the system logic

1. **Import the required Agora Electron modules**

    To integrate <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel quality libraries, in `App.tsx`, add the following statements before `createAgoraRtcEngine,`.

    ```ts
    AudioProfileType,
    AudioScenarioType,
    LastmileProbeConfig,
    QualityType,
    ```

1. **Define variables to manage test state and workflow**

    In `App.tsx`, add the following lines to the declarations:

    ```ts
    var echoTestRunning = false; // A variable to track echo test state.
    ```

1. **Update the network status indication in the UI**

    To show the network quality result visually to the user, in `App.tsx`, add the following code after the `leave` function:

    ```javascript
    const updateNetworkStatus = (Quality: QualityType) => {
        if (Quality > 0 && Quality < 3) {
            setQuality('Excellent');
        } else if (Quality <= 4) {
            setQuality('Poor');
        } else if (Quality <= 6) {
            setQuality('Bad');
        } else {
            setQuality('');
        }
    };
    ```

### Implement features to ensure quality

To implement the call quality features, take the following steps:

1. **Enable the user to test the network**

    In `App.tsx`, add the following method after the `leave` function:

    ```ts
    const startProbeTest = () => {
        // Configure a LastmileProbeConfig instance.
        var config = new LastmileProbeConfig();
        // Probe the uplink network quality.
        config.probeUplink = true;
        // Probe the downlink network quality.
        config.probeDownlink = true;
        // The expected uplink bitrate (bps). The value range is [100000,5000000].
        config.expectedUplinkBitrate = 100000;
        // The expected downlink bitrate (bps). The value range is [100000,5000000].
        config.expectedDownlinkBitrate = 100000;
        agoraEngineRef.current?.startLastmileProbeTest(config);
    };
    ```

1. **Implement best practice for app initiation**

    When a user starts your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> is created and initialized in the `setupVideoSDKEngine` function. After initialization, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> does the following:

    * _Enable dual stream mode_: Required for multi-user scenarios.
    * _Set an audio profile and audio scenario_: Setting an audio profile is optional and only required if you have special requirements such as streaming music.
    * _Set the video profile_: Setting a video profile is also optional. It is useful when you want to change one or more of `mirrorMode`, `frameRate`, `bitrate`, `dimensions`, `orientationMode` or `degradationPrefer` from the default setting to custom values.
    * _Start the network probe test_: A quick test at startup to gauge network quality.

    To implement these features, in `App.tsx`, add the following code after `agoraEngine.initialize({appId: appID});`:

    ```ts
    // Specify the audio scenario and audio profile.
    agoraEngine.setAudioProfile(
        AudioProfileType.AudioProfileMusicHighQualityStereo,
        AudioScenarioType.AudioScenarioGameStreaming,
    );
    // Start the probe test
    startProbeTest();
    ```

1. **Listen to <Vg k="ENGINE" /> events to receive state change notifications and quality statistics**

    Add the following event handlers to receive state change notifications and quality statistics:

    * `onLastmileQuality`: Receives the network quality result.
    * `onLastmileProbeResult`: Receives detailed probe test results.
    * `onNetworkQuality`: Receives statistics on network quality.
    * `onRtcStats`: Receives the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> stats.
    * `onRemoteVideoStateChanged`: Receives notification regarding any change in the state of the remote video.
    * `onRemoteVideoStats`: Receives stats about the remote videos.

    In the `App.tsx`, add the following callbacks in `agoraEngine.registerEventHandler({`:

    ```ts
    onConnectionStateChanged: (connection, state, reason) => {
        console.log(
        'Connection state changed' +
            '\n New state: ' +
            state +
            '\n Reason: ' +
            reason,
        );
    },
    onLastmileQuality: Quality => {
        updateNetworkStatus(Quality);
    },
    onLastmileProbeResult: result => {
        agoraEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
        // The result object contains the detailed test results that help you
        // manage call quality, for example, the downlink jitter.
        console.log('Downlink jitter: ' + result.downlinkReport?.jitter);
    },
    onNetworkQuality(_connection, _Uid, _txQuality, rxQuality) {
        // Use downlink network quality to update the network status
        updateNetworkStatus(rxQuality);
    },
    onRtcStats: (_connection, rtcStats) => {
        console.log(rtcStats.userCount + ' user(s)');
        console.log('Packet loss rate: ' + rtcStats.rxPacketLossRate);
    },
    ```

    Each event reports the statistics of the audio streams from each remote user and host. 

1. **Start and stop the echo test**

    When the user presses **Echo Test**, call `startEchoTest` with the time interval (s) between when you speak and when the recording plays back. When the user presses **Stop test**, end the test.

    In `App.tsx`, add the following function after the `leave` function:

    ```ts
    const echoTest = async () => {
        echoTestRunning = !echoTestRunning;
        if (echoTestRunning) {
            // The time interval between  when you speak and when the recording plays back is 4 second.
            agoraEngineRef.current?.startEchoTest(4);
            showMessage('Echo test started');
        } else {
            // Stop the echo test before you join a channel.
            agoraEngineRef.current?.stopEchoTest();
            showMessage('Echo test stopped');
        }
    };
    ```
