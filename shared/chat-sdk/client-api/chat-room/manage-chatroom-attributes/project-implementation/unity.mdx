### Manage basic chat room attributes

#### Retrieve basic chat room attributes

All chat room members can call `FetchRoomInfoFromServer` to retrieve the detailed information of the current chat room, including the subject, announcement, description, member type, and admin list.

```csharp
// The chat room members can call FetchRoomInfoFromServer to get the information of the specified chat room.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.FetchRoomInfoFromServer(roomId, new ValueCallBack<Room>(
    onSuccess: (room) => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

#### Change chat room subject or description
Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the chat room subject and description.

```csharp
// The chat room owner and admin can call ChangeRoomName to change the chat room subject.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.ChangeRoomName(roomId, name, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));

// The chat room owner and admin can call ChangeRoomDescription to modify the chat room description.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.ChangeRoomDescription(roomId, newDesc, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

#### Retrieve or change chat room announcements

All chat room members can retrieve the chat room announcement.

Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the announcement. Once the announcement is updated, all the other chat room members receive the `OnAnnouncementChangedFromRoom` callback.

```csharp
// Chat room members can call FetchRoomAnnouncement to retrieve the chat room announcement.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.FetchRoomAnnouncement(roomId, new ValueCallBack<string>(
    onSuccess: (announcement) => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));

// The chat room owner and admin can call UpdateRoomAnnouncement to set or update the chat room announcement.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.UpdateRoomAnnouncement(roomId, announcement, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

### Manage custom chat room attributes

#### Set one or more custom attributes

All chat room members can call `AddAttributes` to set one or more custom attributes. Use this method to add new custom attributes or update existing attributes that are set by yourself and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `OnChatroomAttributesChanged` callback.

```csharp
// Sets custom attributes by specifying the chat room ID and key-value maps of the attributes.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.AddAttributes(roomId, kv, deleteWhenExit, forced, new CallBackResult(
    onSuccessResult: (Dictionary<string, int> failInfo) => {
        if(failInfo.Count == 0)
        {
            //AddAttributes success
        }
        else
        {
            //AddAttributes partial success
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

#### Retrieve specified or all custom attributes

All chat room members can call `FetchAttributes` to retrieve the specified or all custom attributes of the chat room.

```csharp
// Retrieves certain or all custom attributes by specifying chat room ID and attribute keys.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.FetchAttributes(roomId, keys, new ValueCallBack<Dictionary<string, string>>(
    onSuccess: (Dictionary<string, string> dict) => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

#### Remove one or more custom attributes

Chat room members can call `RemoveAttributes` to remove one or more custom attributes that are set by themselves and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `OnChatroomAttributesRemoved` callback.

```csharp
// Removes custom attributes by specifying the chat room ID and the attribute key list.
SDKClient.Instance.RoomManager.RemoveAttributes(roomId, keys, forced, new CallBackResult(
    onSuccessResult: (Dictionary<string, int> failInfo) => {
        if (failInfo.Count == 0)
        {
            // All the custom attributes are removed successfully.
        }
        else
        {
            // Certain custom attributes are not removed successfully.
        }
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```
