#### Additional charges

This section describes the additional charges applicable to your account.

#### Charging 8% Singapore Goods and Services Tax

As of November 2021, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Singapore charges [8% Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/goods-and-services-tax-(gst)-what-it-is-and-how-it-works) on invoices for all <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services provided to accounts located in Singapore. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> determines the account location based on the tax identification number, contact address, or billing address that you have provided. All GST collected from Singapore accounts is paid to the Singapore tax authority.

If you have any questions, contact support@agora.io.

#### Fee deduction

On the sixth day of each month, <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> automatically deducts the fee for the previous month and notifies you by email. The services are free of charge, and <Vg k="COMPANY" /> does not deduct any fee when you meet both of the following requirements:

-   Your monthly total service minutes of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/> do not exceed 10,000 charge-free minutes; and

-   You do not use any other charged <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services or products.

If your account balance is negative after the deduction, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> sends you an email, reminding you to [top up your account](../reference/manage-agora-account#add-money-to-account) at your earliest convenience and avoid account suspension.

#### Account suspension

If your account balance is negative for 30 days since the deduction date, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> suspends your account and notifies you by email. None of your projects can access the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services.

If this happens, please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once your balance is greater than or equal to zero, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> unfreezes your account.


<Vg k="COMPANY" /> suspends your account on the second day after any of the following happens:

-   Your total service minutes using <Vpd k="NAME"/> exceed 10,000 charge-free minutes.

-   The number of daily active users (DAU) in your <Vg k="MESS" /> project exceeds 1,000.

-   You use any <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services or products not included in the 10,000 charge-free minutes and the usage exceeds the free quota of the services or products.

After account suspension, none of your projects can access the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> services.

Please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once you top up your account, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> unfreezes your account and upgrades your account to a paid account.

If your total service minutes do not exceed 10,000 minutes, the service is free of charge. After the 10,000 free-of-charge minutes are fully deducted, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> charges you for the additional service minutes. **The remaining free-of-charge minutes will be cleared at the end of each calendar month.

**Note:** The 10,000 free-of-charge minutes policy does not apply to the Agora Signaling SDK, the Chat SDK, or the IoT SDK.

### How does Agora calculate service minutes?

In <Vpd k="NAME"/>, service minutes are calculated either by the number of users or by the number of streams. Agora calculates service minutes **by the number of users**.

#### Approach 1: calculate by the number of users

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, the total service minutes = N \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* 10 = 50.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* 10 = 100.

In this approach, the service minutes purely depend on the number of the users in the channel, regardless of how many streams each user subscribes to.

#### Approach 2: calculate by the number of streams

Suppose N users talk for M minutes in a channel, and each user subscribes to all remote streams in the channel, the total service minutes = N \* (N-1) \* M.

-   If two users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 2 \* (2-1) \* 10 = 20.

-   If five users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 5 \* (5-1) \* 10 = 200.

-   If 10 users talk for 10 minutes, the total service minutes are: 10 \* (10-1) \* 10 = 900.

In this approach, if a user subscribes to multiple streams, every remote stream the user subscribes to is counted.

#### Difference between the two approaches

See the table below for the difference between the two approaches:

| Scenario                        | Service minutes by the number of users | Service minutes by the number of streams |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Two users talk for 10 minutes.  | 20 minutes                             | 20 minutes                               |
| Five users talk for 10 minutes. | 50 minutes                             | 200 minutes                              |
| 10 users talk for 10 minutes.   | 100 minutes                            | 900 minutes                              |

The difference between the two approaches become greater when more people join the channel.

### Calculation approach by Agora

Agora calculates service minutes **by the number of users**, which is easier and more straightforward. Note that service minutes are calculated for aggregate video resolution. See [Calculate aggregate video resolution](../overview/pricing#calculate-aggregate-video-resolution).

## End-of-life policy

Agora is committed to providing regular updates to our Core Products, Extensions, and Tools. These updates encompass a range of improvements, such as new features, updated APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), bug fixes, security patches, and updated documentation. We strongly encourage developers to keep pace with our latest product releases to take advantage of the newest features, security enhancements, and improvements.

This policy statement outlines the stages an Agora product or service moves through, from pre-GA Beta to introduction to retirement, as well as the support Agora provides during each phase.

### Default production introduction period

Agora maintains a default introduction duration of at least 12 months from the release of a product on [Agora.io Developer Center](https://docs.agora.io/en/). During this initial 12-month period, no end-of-support or end-of-life actions will be initiated. However, after this initial 12-month period, Agora reserves the right to transition a product into the Maintenance phase, which marks the beginning of the end-of-support phase.

### Lifecycle of Agora’s SDK

|Phase | Description|
|------|------------|
|Beta | During this phase, SDKs are intended solely for early access and feedback purposes. They are not recommended for use in production environments. Beta products fall outside of Agora’s EOL Policy and are intended for evaluation purposes. See Agora’s Beta Service Agreement for further information.|
|General Availability (GA)|SDKs in this phase are fully supported by Agora. Agora provides support for new services, API updates, feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches. As mentioned earlier, Agora guarantees a minimum of 12 months' support for Generally Available (GA) product SDKs. See additional information below regarding specific support on Client SDKs.|
|Retirement (EOL) SDKs: (Maintenance)|When an SDK enters the Retirement phase, Agora will announce its retirement with a minimum notice of 60 days (approximately 2 months). This announcement will include crucial timelines and guidelines to assist developers in migrating to the latest recommended SDK version. Communication regarding retirement announcements will be conveyed through emails, the Agora Console/Dashboard Notifications center, SDK Documentation, and may also involve social media or Agora blog posts. When an Agora product or service reaches the end-of-support (EOS) or end-of-life (EOL) stage, Agora will cease providing security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support.|

### Standard support periods for client SDKs

For Client SDKs, Agora strives to offer robust support for the periods defined as follows:

|Release|Support|
|-------|-------|
| Major release| We guarantee support for at least 12 months starting from the date of a major release.  |
| Minor release| For minor releases, we ensure support for at least 6 months from the release date.  |

### Maintenance on retirement SDKs

Occasionally, we may transition a product SDK into a maintenance support phase, primarily focused on addressing bugs and providing security patches. In such instances, we will notify our customers at least 60 days (approximately 2 months) in advance of the retirement (end-of-life) period for the affected SDK.

During the Retirement phase, products entering the EOS/EOL phase will continue to be supported as follows:

|Duration | Support |
|---------|---------|
|EOL Announcement Date + 6 months|For the first six months, Agora will provide support for bug fixes and security updates for the old product or service. However, no new requirements for the old product or service will be accepted.|
|EOL Announcement Date + 12 months|For the subsequent six months, Agora will exclusively provide security updates for the old product or service.|
|EOL Announcement Date > 12 months|After the 12-month service ending period, Agora will no longer support the old product or service, unless a pre-arranged Support Extension Request is granted prior to EOL Announcement < 12 months.|

**Note**: While we provide this maintenance support phase, it is essential to understand that using an SDK beyond its product maintenance support cycle is not recommended. Doing so is entirely at the discretion and risk of the developer. We are dedicated to delivering the best SDK experience to our developers, and this policy ensures that you have access to the latest features and security updates while also giving you clear guidance on our support timelines.

### Support extension requests

Customers may apply to extend support for a retired SDK for a temporary period, subject to Agora’s discretion and defined under commercial terms. Agora will review a customer’s requirements and decide whether to license the customer to use the Agora product or service for a limited period outside of the EOL timeline.

### Additional information

For customers requiring more time to transition to the latest version of a product or service, please reach out to your Agora Account Manager, Agora Partnership Manager, or device manufacturer for further information and assistance.

We are committed to providing a smooth transition and support experience throughout the lifecycle of our products and services to ensure the best possible developer experience.
