### Adjust playback volume

This section shows you how to adjust the audio playback signal volume using `AdjustPlaybackSignalVolume`.

1. Create UMG

    Create a **Slider** widget named **Slider_PlaybackSignalVolume** for users to drag the volume bar to adjust the playback volume. In this example, set the minimum value to `0` (mute) and the maximum value to `100` (original volume), as shown in the following figure:

    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-1.png)

1. Bind UI Events

    Create a **Bind Event to On Value Changed node** and connect it to the **Slider_PlaybackSignalVolume** widget and the **OnPlaybackSignalVolumeValChanged** callback. When users drag the volume bar to adjust the audio playback signal, the **OnPlaybackSignalVolumeValChanged** callback is triggered, as shown in the following figure:
    
    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-2.png)

1. Implement Callback Function

    Create **OnPlaybackSignalVolumeValChanged** callback function with the following parameters:

    | Input parameter | Data type | Parameter description |
    | -------- | ------------- | ------------ |
    | `value` | Float | Playback Volume |

    When this callback is triggered, the specified playback volume is obtained and assigned to the Volume parameter of **Adjust Playback Signal Volume**. The **AdjustPlaybackSignalVolume** method is called to adjust the playback volume, as shown in the following figure:

### Adjust recording volume

This section shows you how to adjust the audio recording signal volume using `AdjustRecordingSignalVolume`.

1. Create UMG

    Create a **Slider** widget named **Slider_RecordingSignalVolume** to enable users to adjust the recording volume. For this example, set the minimum value to `0` (mute) and the maximum value to `100` (original volume), as shown in the following figure:
    
    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-4.png)

1. Bind UI Events

    Create a **Bind Event to On Value Changed node** and connect it to the **Slider_RecordingSignalVolume** widget and the **OnRecordingSignalVolumeValChanged** callback. When users drag the volume bar to adjust the audio recording signal, the **OnRecordingSignalVolumeValChanged** callback is triggered, as shown in the following figure:

    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-5.png)

3. Implement UI Events

    Create the **OnRecordingSignalVolumeValChanged** callback function with the following parameters:

    | Input parameter | Data type | Parameter description |
    | -------- | ------------- | ------------ |
    | `value` | Float | Recording Volume |

    When the callback is triggered, the specified recording volume is obtained and assigned to the Volume parameter of **Adjust Recording Signal Volume**. The **AdjustRecordingSignalVolume** method is called to adjust the recording volume, as shown in the following figure:
    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-6.png)

    When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and the options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

    * The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
    * A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
    * If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
    * The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
    * If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Get volume information of usersâ€‹

Throughout the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback, you can obtain the user IDs and volumes of the three users with the highest instant volumes in the channel using the `FOnAudioVolumeIndication` callback. A returned `uid` of `0` represents the local user. You need to call the `EnableAudioVolumeIndication` method to activate the voice detection function to receive this callback.

1. Create UMG

    Create a **Button** widget named **Btn_EnableAudioIndication** for users to control whether to enable the volume indication. As shown in the following figure:

    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-7.png)

1. Bind UI Events

    Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked node** and connect it to the **Btn_EnableAudioIndication** widget and the **OnVolumeIndicationClick** callback. When users press the button to enable the volume indication, the **OnVolumeIndicationClick** callback is triggered, as shown in the following figure:

    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-8.png)

1. Implement UI Events

    Create the **OnVolumeIndicationClick** callback function. When this callback is triggered, the **Enable Audio Volume Indication** method is called to enable volume indication. In this example, set the volume indication **Interval** to 200 milliseconds, the smoothing factor **Smooth** to 3, and check **Report Vad** to activate the voice detection function, as shown in the following figure:
    
    ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-9.png)

4. Add Callback Event

    1. Create the **OnAudioVolumeIndication** callback function with the following parameters:
    
        | Input parameter | Data type | Parameter description |
        | -------- | ------------- | ------------ |
        | `speaker` | Float | Structure Volume information of users, see [FAudioVolumeInfo](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/video-sdk/blueprint/4.x/API/class_irtcengineeventhandler.html#callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onaudiovolumeindication) for details. |
        | `totalVolume` | Integer | The total volume after mixing |


    1. Enable listening to the **OnAudioVolumeIndication** callback, as shown in the following figure:
    
        ![VolumeControlMute](/images/video-sdk/volume-control-mute-implementation-blueprint-10.png)

    1. When the **OnAudioVolumeIndication** callback is triggered, print the received user volume information, as shown in the following figure:
