### Setting the Geofence

    To enable Geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, set the area to a pre-defined region.

    <SetGeofence />

    If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

    * Whitelist certain domains
    * Allow all IP addresses
    * Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to= "../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>
<PlatformWrapper notAllowed={["unity", "react-js", "web"]}>
### Combining multiple Geofence areas

    You can combine multiple area codes, depending on the requirements of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

    <CombineGeofence />
</PlatformWrapper>
