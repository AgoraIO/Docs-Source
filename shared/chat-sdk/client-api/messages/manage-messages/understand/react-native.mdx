SQLCipher is used to encrypt the database that stores local messages. The Chat SDK uses `ChatManager` and `ChatConversation` to manage local messages. Followings are the core methods:

- `ChatManager.getAllConversations`: Loads the conversation list on the local device.
- `ChatManager.deleteConversation`: Deletes the specified conversation.
- `ChatManager.deleteAllMessages`: Deletes all messages sent and received in a local conversation.
- `ChatManager.deleteMessagesWithTimestamp`: Deletes messages sent and received in a certain period in a local conversation.
- `ChatManager.pinConversation`: Pins a conversation.
- `ChatManager.getPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor`: Retrieves the pinned conversations from the server with pagination.
- `ChatManager.removeConversationFromServer`: Deletes the conversation and historical messages from the server.
- `ChatManager.getMsgsWithMsgType`: Searches for messages from the local database.
