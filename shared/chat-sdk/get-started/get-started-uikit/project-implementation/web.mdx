The Chat UI sample for Web has two components:

- `EaseApp`, which contains the conversation list and applies to use cases where you want to quickly launch a real-time chat app.
- `EaseChat`, which contains a conversation box and applies to most chat use cases such as sending and receiving messages, displaying the message on the UI, and managing unread messages. 

This section introduces the steps you need to take to quickly implement one-to-one messaging with `EaseApp`.

1. Import `EaseApp`.

   Open `my-app/src/App.js`, and replace the code with the following:

   ```javascript
    // App.js
    import React, {Component} from 'react';
    import { EaseApp } from "agora-chat-uikit"
    import './App.scss';

    class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <div className="container">
            <EaseApp
                // The App key for your chat project
                appkey= "xxx"
                // The user ID of the current user
                username= "xxx"
                // The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token
                agoraToken= "xxx"
                /> 
        </div>
        );
      }
    }

    export default App;
   ```

2. Set the layout for the conversation.

   Open `my-app/src/App.js`, and replace the content with the following:

   ```javascript
    /** App.css */ 
    .container {
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%
    }
   ```
