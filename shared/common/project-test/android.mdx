3. **Configure the project**

    In `agora-manager/res/raw/config.json`, Replace:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `channelName` - with the name of a channel you want to join.
    * `serverUrl` - with the address of your token server or `rtcToken` with a valid temporary token for `channelName`.

1.  **Start the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**

    1. In Android Studio, connect a physical Android device to your development machine.
    
    1. Click **Run** to start the app.

        A moment later you see the project installed on your device. If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
