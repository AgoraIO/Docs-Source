This article describes how to use the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> to record real-time audio and video.

## Understand the tech

Recording audio and video in a channel using the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> works by adding a special user to the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel. This special user captures the audio and video from the channel, transcodes it, and stores it on your Linux server.

<Admonition type="info">
Integrate the <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> into your Linux server, not your client app. To record audio and video without deploying a Linux server, use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> [<Vg k="CREC" />](/cloud-recording/overview/product-overview).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your local development environment meets the following requirements:

* [Activate the service](/on-premise-recording/get-started/manage-agora-account#generate-temporary-token/) to create an Agora project in the Console and obtain the App ID.
* The project includes basic audio and video interaction scenarios.
* Server hardware requirements:
  * **CPU**: 8 cores, 1.8 GHz
  * **Memory**: At least 4 GB (recommended)
* Server software requirements:
  * **Operating system**: Ubuntu 18.04 or later, or CentOS 7.0 or later
  * **CPU architecture**: arm64 or x86-64
  * **glibc**: Version 2.18 or later
  * **gcc**: Version 4.8 or later
* Network requirements:
  * The server must be connected to the public internet and have a public IP address.
  * The server must allow access to the following domains:

    * `*.agora.io`
    * `*.agoralab.co`

## SDK compatibility

The <Vg k="OPREC_SDK" /> supports the following types of RTC recording:

* Recording from Native Video SDK and Framework SDKs
* Recording from the Web Video SDK
* Cross-platform recording when Web Video SDK communicates with Native or Framework SDKs

The SDK is compatible with the following SDK versions:

| SDK                                | Description             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Native and Framework SDK | Version 1.7.0 or later  |
| Web Video SDK                  | Version 1.12.0 or later |
