3. **Configure the project**:

    In `flutter-reference-app/assets/config/config.json`, Replace:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.
    * `channelName` - with the name of a channel you want to join.
    * `rtcToken` - with a valid temporary token for the `channelName`.

    1. Connect a physical mobile device to your development machine.
    
    1. In your IDE, click **Run** to start the app.

        A moment later you see the project installed on your device. If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

    1. From the main screen of the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, choose **<Vpd k="NAME" />** from the dropdown and then select
    **SDK Quickstart**.

1. **Join a Channel**:

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
    Select an option and click **Join** to start a session.
    - When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
    - When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
