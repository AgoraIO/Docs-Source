In a remote meeting, in addition to showing PPT and portrait images, the speaker may also need to use pictures, video files, and other materials to assist with the presentation. The audience may want to see the following effects:

![Video Compositor](/images/video-calling/video-composite-example.png)

In this scenario, we need to composite the following onto one video track:

- Screen sharing video track.
- Two local images.
- Source video track 1: Created from a video stream captured by a camera, and the background of this track is removed using the Virtual Background extension.
- Source video track 2: Created from a local video file.

In order to create the environment necessary to implement this extension in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.

1. Run the following command to install the Video Compositor extension:
    
    ```bash
    npm install agora-extension-video-compositor
    ```
