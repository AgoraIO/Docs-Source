Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In `index.html`, replace the value for `app_id` with your App ID from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1. Update the value for the `userId` with an integer value.

1. Save the file and run it in your browser. 

1. Make a copy of the project. Use the same `app_id` but a different `userId`. Launch another instance of the page in a separate browser tab. 

1. Type a message in the text input box in either instance and click the **Send** button. The message is displayed in the other app instance.

1. Swap the sending and receiving instances and send another message.

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
