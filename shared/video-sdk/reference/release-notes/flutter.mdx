## v<Vg k = "VSDK_FLUTTER_LATEST_RELEASE"/>

v<Vg k = "VSDK_FLUTTER_LATEST_RELEASE"/> was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

This release changed SDK package name from `agora_rtc_ng` to `agora_rtc_engine`, and optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v5.x. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Custom video capture and renderer (Media IO)
- Error codes and warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to the business scenarios. See [Migration guide](../develop/migration-guide) for details.


#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `RtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions.`

- After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
- You can simultaneously publish multiple sets of video streams captured by multiple cameras or screen sharing by setting `publishSecondaryCameraTrack` and `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions`. (Windows)

This release adds `createCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured video in the channel:

1. Create a custom video track: Call the `createCustomVideoTrack` method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
2. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.
3. Pushing an external video source: Call `pushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in step 2 in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

- Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
- Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
- Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).


**2. Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes.

Besides, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 Ã— 2160) and frame rate to 60 fps when calling `setVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

This feature has certain requirements on device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To enable this feature, [submit a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/).


**3. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `MediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

- Plays local and online media files.
- Preloads media files.
- Changes the CDN route for playing media files according your network conditions.
- Shares the audio and video streams being played with remote users.
- Caches data when playing media files.


**4. Brand-new AI noise reduction**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (versus the basic AI noise reduction in agora_rtc_engine: ^5.x). Compared to the previous AI noise reduction, the new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and add the Dereverberation capability. To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io).

4. **Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

    The SDK supports a new version of Noise Suppression (versus the basic AI Noise Suppression in agora_rtc_engine: ^5.x). Compared to the previous Noise Suppression, the new AI Noise Suppression has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and add the Dereverberation capability. To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](mailto:sales-us@agora.io).

To make audios sound clearer and stay true to the original sound of audio files, this release adds the `ultraHighQualityVoice` enumeration. In scenarios that involve human voices, such as chatting or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.


**6. Spatial audio**

    > **_NOTE:_** This feature is in experimental status. To enable this feature, contact <a href= "mailto:sales-us@agora.io">sales-us@agora.io</a>. Contact Technical Support if needed.

You can set the spatial audio for the remote user as following:

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio by calculating the spatial coordinates of the remote user. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updateRemotePosition` to update the spatial coordinates of the local and remote users respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio of the remote user.

- Local Cartesian Coordinate System Calculation Solution: This solution uses the `LocalSpatialAudioEngine` class to implement spatial audio. You need to call `updateSelfPosition` and `updatePlayerPositionInfo` to update the spatial coordinates of the local user and media player, respectively, so that the local user can hear the spatial audio effect of media player.

**7. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `audioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AudioScenarioType`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.


**8. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.


**9. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function through the following ways.

On Windows and macOS:

- Call the `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method before joining a channel, and then call `joinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.
- Call the `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method after joining a channel, and then call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as `true`.

On Android and iOS:

- Call the `startScreenCapture` method before joining a channel, and then call `joinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as `true`.
- Call the `startScreenCapture` method after joining a channel, and then call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenCaptureVideo` as true.


**10. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add the user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or in your blocklist if you do not want to subscribe to. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `RtcEngineEx` interface.

- `setSubscribeAudioBlacklist`: Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeAudioWhitelist`: Set the audio subscription allowlist.
- `setSubscribeVideoBlacklist`: Set the video subscription blocklist.
- `setSubscribeVideoWhitelist`: Set the video subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.


**11. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `setAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AudioScenarioDefault` to `AudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.


**12. Replace video feeds with images**

This release supports replacing video feeds with images when publishing video streams. You can call the `enableVideoImageSource` method to enable this function and choose your own images through the `options` parameter. If you disable this function, the remote users see the video feeds that you publish.


**13. Local video transcoder**

This release introduces local video transcoder with which you can locally merge multiple video streams into one. Common scenarios are as follows:

When streaming or using media push, you can merge the frames of multiple anchors into one locally. 

To do this, you should merge multi-channel video streams collected locally (such as video captured by camera, screen sharing stream, video files and pictures) into one video stream. Then, release the merged stream in the channel.  

You can call the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to enable the local video transcoder and call the `stopLocalVideoTranscoder` method to stop the local video transcoder; After the local video transcoder is enabled, you can call `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` to update the configuration of the local video transcoder. 


**14. Video device management**

A video capture device may support a variety of video formats, each of which supports a different combination of video frame width, video frame height, and frame rate.

This release introduces the `numberOfCapabilities` and `getCapability` method to obtain the number of video formats supported by video capture devices and the details of video frames under specified video formats. When you call the `startPrimaryCameraCapture` or `startSecondaryCameraCapture` method to capture video using camera, you can obtain the video with the specified video format. 
The SDK will automatically select the video format for video capture equipment according to your settings in `VideoEncoderConfiguration`. In general, you don't need to use this set of new methods. 



#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `switchChannel` in agora_rtc_engine: ^5.x through the `leaveChannel` and `joinChannel` methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `switchChannel` method.

**2. Push external video frames**

This releases supports pushing video frames in I422 format. You can call the `pushVideoFrame` method to push such video frames to the SDK.

**3. Voice pitch of the local user**

This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.

**4. Video preview**

This release improves the implementation logic of `startPreview`. You can call the `startPreview` method to enable video preview at any time.

**5. Video types of subscription**

You can call the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method to choose the video stream type when subscribing streams.
