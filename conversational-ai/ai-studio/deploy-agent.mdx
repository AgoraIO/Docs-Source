Deploy and Connect your agent + 6. Deploy agent
These seem overlapping - need clarification
Option A: Combine into one document

Deploy agent to production
Connect to downstream channels (telephony, web, mobile)

Option B: Separate documents

"Deploy and Connect" = connecting to channels/services
"Deploy agent" = production deployment process

Questions:

What's the distinction between these two topics?
What are the deployment targets (production environment, channels, integrations)?
Is deployment automatic when connecting to telephony, or separate steps?
