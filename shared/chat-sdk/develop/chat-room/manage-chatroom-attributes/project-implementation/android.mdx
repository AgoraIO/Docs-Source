### Retrieve and modify the chat room attributes

All the chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomFromServer` to retrieve the detailed information of the current chat room, including the subject, annoucenments, description, member type, and admin list. The chat room owner and admin can also set and update the chat room information.

```java
// The chat room member call fetchChatRoomFromServer to get the information of the specifeid chat room.
ChatRoom chatRoom = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().fetchChatRoomFromServer(chatRoomId);

// The chat room owner and admin call changeChatRoomSubject to modify the chat room subject.
ChatRoom chatRoom = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().changeChatRoomSubject(chatRoomId, newSubject);

// The chat room owner and admin call changeChatroomDescription to modify the chat room description.
ChatRoom chatRoom = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().changeChatroomDescription(chatRoomId, newDescription);
```


### Manage chat room announcements

All the chat room members can retrieve the chat room announcements. The chat room owner and admin can set and update the announcements. Once the announcements are updated, all the chat room members receive the `onAnnouncementChanged` callback.

```java
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomAnnouncement to retrieve the chat room annoucements.
String announcement = ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(chatRoomId);

// The chat room owner and admin can call updateChatRoomAnnouncement to set or update the chat room announcements.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatroomManager().updateChatRoomAnnouncement(chatRoomId, announcement);
```
