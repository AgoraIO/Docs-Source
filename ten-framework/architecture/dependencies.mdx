The TEN framework uses several third-party libraries. Some are intended specifically for testing, while others are integrated into the TEN runtime. Following is a description of these libraries and the necessary modifications for their use within the TEN framework.

#### Fix for linking `mbedtls` on Windows

Apply the following patch if your CMake version is higher than 3.24, as `find_package` supports the `GLOBAL` keyword since 3.24.

## `curl`

Version: 8.1.2

[MIT-like license](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/COPYING)

A command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, and TFTP. libcurl offers a myriad of powerful features.

Refer to `third_party/curl` for details.

#### Patches for curl

Patch `lib/CMakeLists.txt`, to change the shared library name from `_imp.lib` to `.lib`.

```cmake
if(WIN32)
  if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
    if(MSVC)
      // Add "_imp" as a suffix before the extension to avoid conflicting with
      // the statically linked "libcurl.lib"
      //set_target_properties(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES IMPORT_SUFFIX "_imp.lib")
      set_target_properties(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES IMPORT_SUFFIX ".lib")
    endif()
  endif()
endif()
```

Export `Curl_ws_done` in `lib/ws.h`. This function is called to prevent memory leaks.

```c
CURL_EXTERN void Curl_ws_done(struct Curl_easy *data);
// ^^^^^^^^
```
