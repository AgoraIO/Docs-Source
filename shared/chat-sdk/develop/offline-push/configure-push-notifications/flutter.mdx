You can use extension fields to implement customized push settings. This page uses force push and sending silent messages as examples to explain how to implement push extensions.

## Set custom push fields

When creating a push message, you can add custom fields to the message to meet personalized business needs:

```dart
// This example takes text messages as an example. The setting methods for message types such as pictures and files are the same.
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
  targetId: 'receiveId',
  content: 'content',
);
msg.attributes = {
  // Set the push extension to the message.
  "em_push_ext": {
        "custom": {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2"
        }
    }
};
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

The data structure of the custom field is as follows:

```json
{
    "em_push_ext": {
        "custom": {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2"
        }
    }
}
```

| Parameters              | Description                |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
|  `em_push_ext`   | The extension fixed value, cannot be modified.     |
|  `custom`          | The message extension. Use the extension method to add custom fields to the push, the value is fixed. |
|  `key1`/`key2`     | Customize the specific content of the message push extension. |

## Force push

The user can set force push to ignore the recipient's DND setting when sending messages:

```dart
// This example takes text messages as an example. The setting methods for message types such as pictures and files are the same.
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
  targetId: 'receiveId',
  content: 'content',
);
msg.attributes = {
  'em_force_notification': true,
};
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

## Send a silent message

Sending silent messages means that the sender sets the message not to be pushed when sending it. That is, when the user is offline, Chat will not push message notifications to the user's device through the FCM push service. When the user is online again, they will receive all the messages received during the offline period.

Both silent message sending and do not disturb mode pause push messages. The difference is that silent message sending is set by the sender when sending the message, while the DND mode is set by the receiver.

```dart
// This example takes text messages as an example. The setting methods for message types such as pictures and files are the same.
ChatMessage msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
  targetId: 'receiveId',
  content: 'content',
);
msg.attributes = {
  'em_ignore_notification': true,
};
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```
