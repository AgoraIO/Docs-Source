This page introduces the billing policy for the <Vpd k="NAME"/> add-on provided by Agora.

Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.

## Overview

Agora calculates the billing of all projects under your Agora account on a monthly basis. Billing begins once you
enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

## Transcription fee

When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for a channel, it transcribes the audio of its active hosts. When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled for specific hosts, it only transcribes the audio of the specified hosts and ignores the others. The <Vpd k="NAME"/> service extracts the non-trivial signal and employs an algorithm to reduce the impact of WER performance to generate the signal part for transcription (also called transcription duration). Then Agora charges for the transcription duration of all or specified hosts in the channel.

|Billing item |Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|Transcription fee|Above 0         | 16.99                     |

## Transcription standby fee

When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled, the signal is extracted all the time. Agora charges for the time the signal is being extracted without transcribing, also known as the transcription standby duration. Transcription standby duration = max (STT enable duration - transcription duration, 0).

|Billing item|Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|Transcription standby fee|Above 0         | 1.00                     |

## Language identification fee

<Vpd k="NAME"/> supports dynamic language detection when two or more languages are enabled for a channel or specific hosts. The charged duration is the same as the transcription duration.

The transcription duration is not increased if you enable multiple languages. If only 1 language is enabled for a channel or specified hosts, there is no language identification fee.

|Billing item|Usage, minutes per month |Pricing, US$/1,000 minutes|
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|Language identification fee|Above 0         | 5.00                     |
