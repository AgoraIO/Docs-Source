By default, the SDK generates three log files, `easemob.log` and two `easemob_Y-m-d_H-M-S.log` files, each with a maximum size of 2048 KB (2 MB). These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest logs in `easemob.log`. When `easemob.log` is full, the SDK renames it to the name of the current time-dependent log file. If there are more than three log files, the SDK deletes the earliest log file, and creates a new `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

For example, the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record logs at 8:00:00 a.m. on January 1, 2024. If this file is completely written at 8:30:00 a.m., the SDK renames it `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log`. At 9:30:00 a.m. and 10:30:30 a.m., the SDK generates `easemob_2024-01-01_09-30-30.log` and `easemob_2024-01-01_10-30-30.log`. At this time, `easemob_2024-01-01_08-30-00.log` will be removed before the SDK generates `easemob.log` to record the latest logs.

## Collect SDK logs

To access SDK logs, take the following steps:

1. Enable the debug mode.

    In this mode, the SDK outputs all types of logs, including debugging information, warnings, and errors.

    ```java
    ChatClient.getInstance().setDebugMode(true);
    ```

    If you only require error logs, disable the debug mode.

    ```java
    ChatClient.getInstance().setDebugMode(false);
    ```

2. Get local logs.

    Open the logs directory `/sdcard/Android/data/{package name}/{appkey}/core_log/` which contains the SDK logs.

    ```shell
    adb pull /sdcard/android/data/{package name}/{appkey}/core_log
    ```
