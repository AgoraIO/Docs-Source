The `RtcConnectionObserver` class is used to monitor the SDK connection state.

### `OnConnected`

Triggered when the SDK's connection state to the channel changes to `3`.

```go
OnConnected func(con *RtcConnection, conInfo *RtcConnectionInfo, reason int)
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`con`|The RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details.|
|`conInfo`|Connection information. See [`RtcConnectionInfo`](#rtcconnectioninfo) for details.|
|`reason`|Connection state change reason:<ul><li>`0`: Establishing a network connection.</li><li>`1`: Successfully joined the channel.</li><li>`2`: Network connection interrupted.</li><li>`3`: Network connection forbidden by the server.</li><li>`4`: Failed to join the channel.</li><li>`5`: Left the channel.</li><li>`6`: Invalid App ID. Please change to a valid App ID and try again.</li><li>`7`: Invalid channel name. Please change to a valid channel name and try again.</li><li>`8`: The generated token is invalid. Generally, the following reasons:<ul><li>App Certificate is enabled on the console, but the Token is not used when joining the channel.

### `OnTokenPrivilegeWillExpire`

Triggered when the token is about to expire within 30 seconds.

```go
OnTokenPrivilegeWillExpire func(con *RtcConnection, token string)
```

During a call, if the token is about to expire, the SDK will trigger this callback 30 seconds in advance to remind the app to update the token.

Upon receiving this callback, you need to generate a new token on your server and then call [`RenewToken`](#renewtoken) to pass the newly generated token to the SDK.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `con` | RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details. |
| `token` | The token that is about to expire. |

### `OnTokenPrivilegeDidExpire`

Triggered when the token has expired.

```go
OnTokenPrivilegeDidExpire func(con *RtcConnection)
```

During a call, if the token has expired, the SDK will trigger this callback to remind the app to update the token.

Upon receiving this callback, you need to generate a new token on your server and then call [`Connect`](#connect) to reconnect to the channel.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `con` | RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details. |

### `OnUserJoined`

Triggered when a remote user joins the channel. You can use this callback to get the ID of the remote user.

```go
OnUserJoined func(con *RtcConnection, uid string)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `con` | RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details. |
| `uid` | User ID of the remote user. |

### `OnUserLeft`

Triggered when a remote user leaves the channel. You can use the `reason` parameter to get the reason why the user left the channel.

```go
OnUserLeft func(con *RtcConnection, uid string, reason int)
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`con`|RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details.|
|`uid`|User ID of the remote user.|
|`reason`|Connection state change reason:<ul><li>`0`: Establishing a network connection.</li><li>`1`: Successfully joined the channel.</li><li>`2`: Network connection interrupted.</li><li>`3`: Network connection forbidden by the server.</li><li>`4`: Failed to join the channel.</li><li>`5`: Left the channel.</li><li>`6`: Invalid App ID. Please change to a valid App ID and try again.</li><li>`7`: Invalid channel name. Please change to a valid channel name and try again.</li><li>`8`: The generated token is invalid. Generally, the following reasons:<ul><li>App Certificate is enabled on the console, but the Token is not used when joining the channel. When App Certificate is enabled, you must use a Token.</li><li>The uid specified in [`connect`](#connect) when joining the channel does not match the uid used when generating the Token.</li></ul></li><li>`9`: The generated Token is invalid.</li><li></li><li>`10`: This user is banned by the server.</li><li>`11`: SDK attempts to reconnect due to setting a proxy server.</li><li>`12`: The network connection state changes due to updating the Token.</li><li>`13`: The client IP address changes, possibly due to changes in network type or the IP or port of the network operator.</li><li>`14`: SDK connection to the server times out, enters the automatic reconnection state.</li><li>`15`: Rejoined the channel successfully.</li><li>`16`: SDK and the server lose connection.</li><li>`17`: The connection state changes due to the echo test.</li><li>`18`: The user changed the local IP address.</li></ul>|

### `OnStreamMessageError`

Triggered when an error occurs in receiving stream messages. This callback indicates that the local user did not receive the stream message sent by the remote user using the [`send_stream_message`](#sendstreammessage) method.

```go
OnStreamMessageError func(con *RtcConnection, uid string, streamId int, errCode int, missed int, cached int)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Description  |
|-------------|----------|
| `con` | RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details. |
| `uid`   | User ID of the sender.              |
| `streamId` | Stream ID of the received message.         |
| `errCode`      | Error code of the occurred error.                |
| `missed`    | Number of missed messages.                     |
| `cached`    | Number of cached messages when the stream was interrupted.          |

### `OnError`

Triggered when an error occurs. This callback method indicates that a network or media-related error occurred while the SDK was running. Generally, errors reported by the SDK mean that the SDK cannot automatically recover and requires intervention from the app or user notification.

```go
OnError func(con *RtcConnection, err int, msg string)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Description  |
|-------------|----------|
| `con`   | RTC connection object. See [`RtcConnection`](#rtcconnection) for details.              |
| `err` | Error code.         |
| `msg`      | Error description.                |
