### v2.1.7

v2.1.7 was released on January 22, 2024.

#### Improvements

1. Optimized the processing logic of expired user status data when disconnected and reconnected.

2. Improved the reliability of message transmission in a Stream Channel under weak network conditions.

#### Fixed issues

- When calling the `getOnlineUsers` method and setting `includeUserId` to `true`, the parameter `includeState` set to `false` was missing from the `nextPage` return value.
- In the case of randomly subscribing to a Topic, what the user `message` received in the event notification `publisher` was inconsistent with the actual message sender.
- After repeatedly subscribing to the same channel, unsubscribing or leaving the channel failed.

### v2.1.5

v2.1.5 was released on December 22, 2023

This release makes changes to the following APIs. Modify your implementation code after upgrading the SDK:

- Change the parameter type of the `messageType` from `string | binary` to `STRING | BINARY`.
- Rename the `TokenPrivilegeWillExpire` callback to `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire`.

#### New features

1. Stream Channel

    Experience seamless, delay-free data flow from one point to another. Stream channel solution refers to a real-time data pipeline that enables the uninterrupted flow of data from one point to another without delay or latency.

2. Pub/Sub

    Embrace asynchronous messaging, enabling instant communication between publishers and subscribers without the need for immediate responses. The pub/sub model is a messaging pattern used in real-time messaging solutions where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive messages from the channels they are subscribed to.

3. Topic

    Effectively manage data streams with topics, enabling seamless communications between users. Topic serves as a data flow management mechanism in the stream channel. It enables users to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events of data streams. Topics allow users to register as message publishers, send messages, and receive messages from subscribed publishers in a channel.

4. Storage

    Storage is important in signaling solutions to ensure reliable message delivery and prevent message loss or drop.

5. Removing Event Listeners

    This release adds the `removeEventListener` method. You can use it to remove a specified event listener.

6. Interval Mode

    This release supports the interval mode of presence function. When the number of online users in a channel exceeds the specified **Announce Max** value, the channel enters the interval mode. The SDK triggers the `presence` event notification at regular intervals and provides aggregated incremental information about user join, leave, timeout, and state changes in the `interval` property. For more details, see [Interval Mode](../reference/api?platform=web#presence-event-types).

#### Improvements

1. Presence Service

    User and device online/offline and status change notification capabilities get a list of online users in a channel, retrieve the channel list of online users, and dynamically monitor users joining or leaving channels.

    This release also improves the behavior of calling presence APIs when the presence service is not ready. After joining a stream channel or subscribing to a message channel, if the presence service is not ready, the SDK locally stores your operations related to the presence module and sends them out once the presence service becomes ready.

    Additionally, in the return value of the `getOnlineUsers` method, this release removes the information of timed-out users.

2. Subscribing Message Publisher

    This release improvements the behavior of subscribing to message publishers with invalid user IDs. When calling the `{topic.subscribe[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` method, if the list of publishers (`users` property) contains invalid user IDs, the SDK ignores the invalid user IDs and can successfully subscribe to the valid users.

3. Custom Message Type

    This release supports to pass special characters such as Chinese characters into the `customType` parameter when calling the `{message.publish[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` or `{topic.publish[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` methods.

4. Encryption Salt

    This release allows to omit the `salt` parameter when setting encryption.

5. State Synchronization

    Ensures that the shared state between devices or systems remains consistent and up to date in real time.

6. Authentication

    Utilize token-based access control, ensuring secure interactions and protecting data.

7. Locks

    Implement locks to maintain the sequence of messages, ensuring your data is processed in a specific order, preventing any data conflicts. When a client accesses a resource, it can acquire a lock on that resource to prevent other clients from accessing it.

8. Logout Optimization

    This release reduces the response time of the `logout` method.

9. Error Message Optimization

    To facilitate troubleshooting, this release adds error descriptions for each error code and adds error stacks in the error messages of the storage and lock modules. Additionally, this release removes the `RTM_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT(-2)` and `RTM_ERROR_TOO_OFTEN(-12)` error codes, and adds the following error codes:

    - `RTM_ERROR_LOGIN_NOT_AUTHORIZED(-10015)`
    - `RTM_ERROR_INCONSISTENT_APPID(-10016)`
    - `RTM_ERROR_INVALID_CHANNEL_TYPE(-10019)`
    - `RTM_ERROR_INVALID_ENCRYPTION_PARAMETER(-10020)`
    - `RTM_ERROR_OPERATION_RATE_EXCEED_LIMITATION(-10021)`

    For error code descriptions and troubleshooting ways, see [Error Codes](../reference/api?platform=web#error-codes-table).

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- The SDK version information was lost in the log file.
- The `userId` property of the `GetStateResponse` data type was `null`.
- After calling the `removeState` method, the SDK returned the `RemoveStateResponse` data type before the removing operation.
- Exceptions in poor network scenarios.
- When joining a channel and setting the parameter as `withPresence: false`, the `userId` property returned by the `{presence.getstate[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` method was empty.
- During network disconnection and reconnection, any API call failed and returned the `RTM_ERROR_NOT_LOGIN(-10002)` error code.
- Calling any API of the presence module failed when the client woke up from sleep mode.
- Calling the `login` method failed when the resource was not loaded.
- If special characters such as Chinese were passed into the API of the presence module, messages sent to the remote client were truncated.
