### Message delivery receipts

To send a message delivery receipt, take the following steps:

1. When initializing the SDK, set `requireDeliveryAck` in `ChatOptions` as `true` on the sender's client.

    ```dart
    // The App Key
    String appKey = "appKey";
    // Enables message delivery receipt
    bool requireDeliveryAck = true;
    ChatOptions options = ChatOptions(
    appKey: appKey,
    requireDeliveryAck: requireDeliveryAck,
    );
    await ChatClient.getInstance.init(options);
    ```

2. Once the recipient receives the message, the SDK triggers `onMessagesDelivered` on the message sender's client, notifying the message sender that the message has been delivered to the recipient. Listen for the `onMessagesDelivered` callback on the sender's client:

    ```dart
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
      "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
      ChatEventHandler(
        onMessagesDelivered: (messages) {},
      ),
    );
    ```

### Conversation and message read receipts

In both one-to-one chats and group chats, you can use message read receipts to notify the message sender that the message has been read. To minimize the method call for message read receipts, the SDK also supports conversation read receipts in one-to-one chats.

#### One-to-one chats

In one-to-one chats, the SDK supports sending both the conversation read receipts and message read receipts. Agora recommends using conversation read receipts if the new message arrives when the message recipient has not entered the conversation UI.

##### Conversation read receipts

Follow the steps to implement conversation read receipts in one-to-one chats.

1. When initializing the SDK, set `requireAck` in `ChatOptions` as `true`.

    ```dart
    ChatOptions options = ChatOptions(
    appKey: "<#Your AppKey#>",
    requireAck: true,
    );
    ChatClient.getInstance.init(options);
    ```

2. When a user enters the conversation UI, check whether the conversation contains unread messages. If yes, call `sendConversationReadAck` to send a conversation read receipt.

    ```dart
    String convId = "convId";
    try {
    await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendConversationReadAck(convId);
    } on ChatError catch (e) {
    // Sending conversation read receipts fails. See e.code for the error code and e.description for the error description.
    }
    ```

3. The message sender listens for message events and receives the conversation read receipt in `onConversationRead`.

    ```dart
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
      "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
      ChatEventHandler(
        onConversationRead: (from, to) {},
      ),
    );
    ```


<div class="alert note">In scenarios where a user is logged in multiple devices, if the user sends a conversation read receipt from one device, the server sets the count of unread messages in the conversation as 0, and all the other devices receive `onConversationRead`.</div>

##### Message read receipts

To implement the message read receipt in one-to-one chats, take the following steps:

1. When initializing the SDK, set `requireAck` in `ChatOptions` as `true`.

    ```dart
    ChatOptions options = ChatOptions(
    appKey: "<#Your AppKey#>",
    requireAck: true,
    );
    ChatClient.getInstance.init(options);
    ```

2. The message sender listens for the message receipt in `onMessagesRead`:

    ```dart
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
      "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
      ChatEventHandler(
        onMessagesRead: (messages) {},
      ),
    );
    ```

3. When the message arrives, the recipient reads the message and calls `sendMessageReadAck` to notify the sender that the message is read. The SDK will trigger `onMessagesRead` on the sender's client.

    ```dart
    try {
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessageReadAck(msg);
    } on ChatError catch (e) {
    // Fails to send the message. See e.code for the error code, and e.description for the error description.
    }
    ```

#### Chat groups

For a group chat, group members can determine whether to require message read receipts when sending a message. If yes, after a group member reads the message, the SDK sends a read receipt. In a group chat, the number of message read receipts that are sent for the message refers to the number of group members that have read this message.

The following table shows the restrictions of this feature:

| Feature Restriction| Default | Description |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- |
| Enabling the function | Disabled | To use this feature, contact support@agora.io to enable it. |
| Permission  | Group owner and administrators  | By default, only the group owner and administrators can request read receipts when sending a message. <br/>You can contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to grant the permission to regular group members.|
| Number of days before read receipts cannot be returned after the message is sent   | 3 days    | The server no longer records the group members that read the message three days after it is sent, nor sends the read receipts.   |
| Chat group size   | 500 members   | This feature is available only to groups with up to 500 members. In other words, each message in a group can have up to 500 read receipts. If the upper limit is exceeded, the latest read receipt record will overwrite the earliest one.  |
| Maximum number of group messages that can have read receipts per day   | 500 | A group can have up to 500 messages each day for which read receipts can be returned. |

Follow the steps to implement read receipts for a chat group message:

1. To receive the chat group message read receipts, the sender listens for the `onGroupMessageRead` callback.

    ```dart
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.addEventHandler(
      "UNIQUE_HANDLER_ID",
      ChatEventHandler(
        onGroupMessageRead: (messages) {},
      ),
    );
    ```

2. The sender sends a chat group message. Ensure that you set `needGroupAck` as `true`.

    ```dart
    // Sets the chat type as group chat
    msg.chatType = ChatType.GroupChat;
    // Whether to require a group message read receipt
    msg.needGroupAck = true;
    try {
    await ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
    } on ChatError catch (e) {
        // Fails to send the message. See e.code for the error code, and e.description for the error description.
    }
    ```

3. The chat group member reads the message and call `sendGroupMessageReadAck` to send a chat group message receipt. The SDK will trigger `onGroupMessageRead` on the sender's client.

    ```dart
    try {
    ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendGroupMessageReadAck(msgId, groupId);
    } on ChatError catch (e) {
    // Fails to send the group message read receipt. See e.code for the error code, and e.description for the error description.
    }
    ```
