### Set push translation

Push notifications work with the translation feature. If a user enables the automatic translation feature and sends a message, the SDK will send both the original message and the translated message.

As a recipient, the user can set the preferred language for push notifications they want to receive when offline. If the language of the translated message matches their preferred language, the translated message is displayed in the push notification; otherwise, the original message is displayed.

Call `setPushPerformLanguage` to set the preferred language for push notifications. The sample code is as follows:

```javascript
// Set the preferred language for push notifications.
const params = {
  language: "EU",
};
connection.setPushPerformLanguage(params);

// Get the preferred language for push notifications.
connection.getPushPerformLanguage();
```
