### Generate temporary tokens

To ensure communication security, best practice is to use tokens to authenticate the users who log in from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

To generate a temporary RTC token for use in your <Vg k="VSDK" /> projects:

1. On the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page, click the pencil icon next to your project.

1. On the **Security** panel, click **Generate Temp Token**, enter a channel name in the pop-up box and click **Generate**. Copy the generated RTC token for use in your Video SDK projects.

To generate a token for other <Vg k="COMPANY"/> products:

1. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> token builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/).

1. Choose the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> product your user wants to log in to. Fill in **App ID** and **App Certificate** with the
details of your project in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1. Customize the token for each user. The required fields are visible in the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token builder.

    <ProductWrapper product="signaling">
    In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You create a token for each user in the channel. When you call `login` using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same as you used to create the token.
    </ProductWrapper>

1. Click **Generate Token**.

    The token appears in Token Builder.

1. Copy the token and use it in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
