To test your proxy connection:

1. **Configure the project**

    1. <OpenConfig/>

    1. <SetAppId/>

    1. <SetAuthenticationMethod/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test proxy connection**:

    1. Open a new instance of the reference app.
    1. Choose the **Connect through restricted networks** example.
    1. Log in to <Vg k="SIG" />. 
    1. Subscribe to a channel.    
        You see your app starts the proxy service and magically connects to the Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ which was not possible in a restricted network environment.
