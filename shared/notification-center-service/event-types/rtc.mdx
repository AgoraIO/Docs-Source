#### 104 broadcaster leave channel
This event type indicates that a host leaves the channel in the streaming profile. The payload contains the following fields:

| Field name | Type|  Description |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| `channelName` | String | The name of the channel. |
| `uid` | Number | The user ID of the host in the channel. |
| `platform` | Number | The platform type of the host's device: <ul><li>1: Android</li><li>2: iOS</li><li>5: Windows</li><li>6: Linux</li><li>7: Web</li><li>8: macOS</li><li>0: Other platform</li></ul> |
| `clientType` | Number | The type of services used by the host on Linux. Common return values include:<ul><li>3: On-premise Recording</li><li>10: Cloud Recording</li></ul>This field is only returned when platform is 6. |
| `clientSeq` | Number | The sequence number, which is used to identify the order in which events occur on the app client. You can use the value of this field to sort the events of a user into chronological order. |
| `reason` | Number | The reason why the host leaves the channel:<ul><li>1: The host quits the call.</li><li>2: The connection between the app client and the Agora RTC server times out, which occurs when the Agora SD-RTN does not receive any data packets from the app client for more than 10 seconds.</li><li>3: Permission issues. For example, the host is kicked out of the channel by the administrator through the Banning user privileges RESTful API.</li><li>4: Internal issues with the Agora RTC server. For example, the Agora RTC server disconnects from the app client for a short period of time for load balancing. When the load balancing is finished, the Agora RTC server reconnects with the client.</li><li>5: The host uses a new device to join the channel, which forces the old device to leave the channel.</li><li>9: The app client has multiple IP addresses, therefore the SDK actively disconnects from the Agora RTC server and reconnects. The user is not aware of this process. Check whether the app client has multiple public IP addresses or uses a VPN</li><li>10: Due to network connection issues, for example, the SDK does not receive any data packets from the Agora RTC server for more than 4 seconds or the socket connection error occurs, the SDK actively disconnects from the Agora server and reconnects. The user is not aware of this process. Check the network connection status.</li><li>999: The user has unusual activities, such as frequent login and logout actions. 60 seconds after receiving the 104 or 106 event callback with reason as 999, your app server needs to call the Banning user privileges API to remove the user from the current channel; otherwise, your server could fail to receive any notification callbacks about the user's events if the user rejoins the channel.</li><li>0: Other reasons.</li></ul> | 
| `ts` | Number | The Unix timestamp (s) when the event occurs on the Agora RTC server.
| `duration` | Number | The length of time (s) that the host stays in the channel.
