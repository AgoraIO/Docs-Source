### Manage basic chat room attributes

#### Retrieve basic chat room attributes

 All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer` to retrieve the basic attributes of a chat room, including the chat room ID, name, description, announcement, owner, admin list, maximum number of members, and whether all members are muted.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve basic chat room attributes:

```dart
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer to retrieve the basic attributes of a chat room.
try {
  ChatRoom room = await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer(roomId);
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Change the chat room subject or description

Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the chat room subject and description.

```dart
// The chat room owner and admin can call changeChatRoomName to change the chat room subject.
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.changeChatRoomName(
    roomId,
    newName,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}

// The chat room owner and admin call changeChatRoomDescription to modify the chat room description.
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.changeChatRoomDescription(
    roomId,
    newDesc,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

#### Retrieve or change chat room announcements

All chat room members can retrieve the chat room announcement.

Only the chat room owner and admin can set and update the announcement. Once the announcement is updated, all the other chat room members receive the `ChatRoomEventHandler#onAnnouncementChangedFromChatRoom` callback.

```dart
// Chat room members can call fetchChatRoomAnnouncement to retrieve the chat room announcement.
try {
  String? announcement =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(
    roomId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
// The chat room owner and admin can call updateChatRoomAnnouncement to set or update the chat room announcement.
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.updateChatRoomAnnouncement(
    roomId,
    newAnnouncement,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Manage custom chat room attributes

#### Set one ore more custom attributes

Chat room members can call `addAttributes` to set one or more custom attributes. Use this method to add new custom attributes or update existing attributes that are set by yourself and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `EMChatRoomEventHandler#onAttributesUpdated` callback.

```dart
// Sets custom attributes by specifying the chat room ID and key-value maps of the attributes.
try {
  Map<String, int>? failInfo =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.addAttributes(
    "room",
    attributes: kv,
    deleteWhenLeft: true,
    overwrite: true,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

#### Retrieve specified or all custom attributes

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomAttributes` to retrieve the specified or all custom attributes of the chat room.

```dart
// Retrieves certain or all custom attributes by specifying chat room ID and attribute keys.
try {
    Map<String, String>? attributes =
        await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomAttributes(
        roomId,
        keys,
    );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```

#### Remove one or more custom attributes

Chat room members can call `removeAttributes` to remove one or more custom attributes that are set by themselves and others. After you successfully call this method, other members in the chat room receive an `EMChatRoomEventHandler#onAttributesRemoved` callback.

```dart
// Removes custom attributes by specifying the chat room ID and the attribute key list.
try {
  Map<String, int>? failInfo =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.removeAttributes(
    roomId,
    keys: keys,
    force: true,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {}
```
