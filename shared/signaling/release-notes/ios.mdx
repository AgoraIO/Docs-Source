### v2.1.11

v2.1.11 was released on May 13, 2024.

#### Improvements

**New privacy information file**

    To meet Apple's security and compliance requirements for app distribution, this release adds a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file. It contains API call instructions for accessing or using user data within the SDK, as well as descriptions of the data types collected by the SDK.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Information">
    If you need to distribute an app with SDK versions earlier than v2.1.10 on the Apple App Store, you need to manually add the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file to your Xcode project. See [How can I add a privacy manifest to my iOS app?](../../help/other-issues/ios_privacy_manifest)
    </Admonition>

**Other improvements**

This release optimizes the response mechanism when subscribing to channels with the `{enumv.subscribechannelfeaturepresence[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` setting or joining channels with the `{enumv.joinchannelfeaturepresence[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` setting. If the user does not receive the `{enumv.presencetypesnap[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` type of `{config.onpresenceevent[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` event notification within 5 seconds, the SDK will report the `{code.presencenotready[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` error code in the `completionBlock` parameter.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- In specific scenarios, after logging out of the Signaling system and logging back in, occasional failures occurred when subscribing to channels with the `{enumv.subscribechannelfeaturepresence[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` setting or joining channels with the `{enumv.joinchannelfeaturepresence[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` setting.
- In cases where the connection was lost due to network issues and then restored, if the local user actively called the `{channel.leave[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` method to leave the channel, a remote user occasionally did not receive the `{enumv.presencetypetimeout[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` type of the `{config.onpresenceevent[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` event notification.
- Occasional failures occurred when frequently calling the `{channel.subscribe[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` and `{channel.unsubscribe[frontMatter.ag_platform]}` methods.

### v2.1.10

v2.1.10 was released on March 11, 2024.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- When sending messages frequently, message sending occasionally timed out.
- After calling `renewToken` to renew the token, some services were not functioning correctly, resulting in unexpected disconnection.

### v2.1.9

v2.1.9 was released on February 14, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release improves message publishing options as follows:

- Removes the `sendTs` parameter, and adds the `channelType` parameter in `AgoraRtmPublishOptions`. See details in [`AgoraRtmPublishOptions`](../reference/api/#messagepublishpropsag_platform).
- Modifies the type of the `options` parameter in the `publishTopicMessage` method from `AgoraRtmPublishOptions` to `AgoraRtmTopicMessageOptions`. See details in [`AgoraRtmTopicMessageOptions`](../reference/api/#topicpublishpropsag_platform).

#### Improvements

This release adds the following improvements:

- Adds error codes: `AgoraRtmErrorInvalidChannelType`, `AgoraRtmErrorInvalidEncryptionParameter`, and `AgoraRtmErrorOperationRateExceedLimitation`. For error code descriptions and solutions, see [Error Codes](../reference/api#error-codes-table).
- Optimizes the handling logic for expired user status data during reconnection.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixes the following issues:

- The initialization process did not return a failure when the `encryptionKdfSalt` parameter length was not 32 bytes.
- Occasional crashes occurred when calling the `getOnlineUsers` method to retrieve paginated results.
- The memory leak issue during initialization.

### v2.1.7

v2.1.7 was released on January 22, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

1. Initialization parameters

    To remind users to set the required parameters during initialization, this release adds the following methods:

    - The `init` method in `AgoraRtmMetadata`, which prevents users from initializing without providing the required parameters.
    - The `init` and `initWithServer` methods in `AgoraRtmProxyConfig`, which require users to provide the `server`, `port`, and `proxyType` parameters during initialization.
    - The `init` and `initWithAppId` methods in `AgoraRtmClientConfig`, which require users to provide the `appId` and `userId` parameters during initialization.

1. Channel options

    This release adds the following changes to the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption` and `AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions` classes:

    - Removes the `withMetadata`, `withPresence`, and `withLock` parameters from the `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption` class, and adds a `features` parameter as a replacement. You can set one or more event notifications in the `features` parameter based on your needs.
    - Removes the `withMessage`, `withMetadata`, `withPresence`, and `withLock` parameters from the `AgoraRtmSubscribeOptions` class, and adds a `features` parameter as a replacement. You can set one or more event notifications in the `features` parameter based on your needs.

    This release also improves the performace of setting the presence event notification in `AgoraRtmJoinChannelOption`.

1. Naming changes

    This release renames the following callbacks:

    | Before v2.1.6 | v2.1.6 |
    | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
    | `onMessageEvent` | `didReceiveMessageEvent` |
    | `onPresenceEvent` | `didReceivePresenceEvent` |
    | `onLockEvent` | `didReceiveLockEvent` |
    |`onStorageEvent` | `didReceiveStorageEvent`|
    | `onTopicEvent` | `didReceiveTopicEvent` |
    |`onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` | `tokenPrivilegeWillExpire` |
    |`connectionStateChanged` | `connectionChangedToState` |

    This release also renames the `items` parameter of the `removeState` method to `keys`, and changes the type of the `areaCode` parameter from `unsigned int` to `AgoraRtmAreaCode`.

#### New features

1. Stream Channel

    Experience seamless, delay-free data flow from one point to another. Stream channel solution refers to a real-time data pipeline that enables the uninterrupted flow of data from one point to another without delay or latency.

2. Pub/Sub

    Embrace asynchronous messaging, enabling instant communication between publishers and subscribers without the need for immediate responses. The pub/sub model is a messaging pattern used in real-time messaging solutions where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive messages from the channels they are subscribed to.

3. Topic

    Effectively manage data streams with topics, enabling seamless communications between users. Topic serves as a data flow management mechanism in the stream channel. It enables users to subscribe to, distribute, and notify events of data streams. Topics allow users to register as message publishers, send messages, and receive messages from subscribed publishers in a channel.

4. Storage

    Storage is important in signaling solutions to ensure reliable message delivery and prevent message loss or drop.

5. Removing Event Listeners

    This release adds the removeEventListener method. You can use it to remove a specified event listener.

6. Interval Mode

    This release supports the interval mode of presence function. When the number of online users in a channel exceeds the specified Announce Max value, the channel enters the interval mode. The SDK triggers the presence event notification at regular intervals and provides aggregated incremental information about user join, leave, timeout, and state changes in the interval property. For more details, see [Interval Mode](../reference/api#presence-event-types).

7. Multiple ways to add event listeners

    This release adds the `addDelegate` and `removeDelegate` methods. In addition to adding or removing an event listener object during initialization, you can also call the new methods to add or remove one or more event listener objects at any time during the app's lifecycle.

8. Locks

    Implement locks to maintain the sequence of messages, ensuring your data is processed in a specific order, preventing any data conflicts. When a client accesses a resource, it can acquire a lock on that resource to prevent other clients from accessing it.

#### Improvements

1. Message sending

    This release adds two new methods, `publish` and `publishTopicMessage`, which have the same name as existing methods. Additionally, this release changes the type of the `message` parameter in the original methods. See details as follows:

    ```objc
    // Before v2.1.6
    // The type of the message parameter is NSObject
    // The NSObject type supports passing both string and binary messages
    - (void) publish: (NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
                message: (NSObject* _Nonnull)message
                withOption: (AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
                completion: (AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock;

    - (void) publishTopicMessage: (NSObject * _Nonnull) message
                inTopic: (NSString * _Nonnull) topic
                withOption:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable) options
                completion: (AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock;
    ```

    ```objc
    // v2.1.6
    // The type of the message parameter is NSString or NSData
    // The NSString type only supports passing string data
    // The NSData type only supports passing binary data

    // publish[1/2]
    - (void) publish:(NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
            message:(NSString* _Nonnull)message
            option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
        completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publish[2/2]
    - (void) publish:(NSString* _Nonnull)channelName
                data:(NSData* _Nonnull)data
            option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions* _Nullable)publishOption
        completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publishTopicMessage[1/2]
    - (void) publishTopicMessage:(NSString * _Nonnull)topic
                        message:(NSString * _Nonnull)message
                        option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable)options
                    completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock

    // publishTopicMessage[2/2]
    - (void) publishTopicMessage:(NSString * _Nonnull)topic
                            data:(NSData * _Nonnull)data
                        option:(AgoraRtmPublishOptions * _Nullable)options
                    completion:(AgoraRtmOperationBlock _Nullable)completionBlock
    ```

1. Message receiving

    This release removes the `getData` method, `getType` method, and `AgoraRtmMessageType` class in the `AgoraRtmMessage` class, and adds the `rawData` and `stringData` properties instead. You can use the `rawData` property to receive binary messages, and the `stringData` property to receive string messages.

1. Response and error message optimization

    This release changes the information returned by the `completionBlock` callback function in various methods:

    - If the method call is successful, the `response` parameter returns the corresponding data, and the `errorInfo` parameter returns `nil`.
    - If the method call fails, the `response` parameter returns `nil`, and the `errorInfo` parameter returns the corresponding error message.

    Additionally, this release adds an `error` parameter to the `initWithConfig` and `createStreamChannel` methods. If the method call fails, you can see the output error description in the `error` parameter.

#### Fixed issues

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional inability to log out of the RTM system when the network status changed.
- Occasional inability to log in to the RTM system after logging out when the network status changed.
- When the network was disconnected, users occasionally did not receive the `Snapshot` event notification due to that the app did not clear data.
- When a user joined a channel and switched the app to the background and then back to the foreground, the SDK occasionally triggered the `REMOTE_JOIN` event notification multiple times.
