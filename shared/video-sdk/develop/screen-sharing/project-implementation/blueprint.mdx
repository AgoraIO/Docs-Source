This section shows you how to implement <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> in your project.

### Android and iOS platforms

This subsection describes how to start and stop screen sharing on Android and iOS mobile platforms.

#### Create buttons

Create two button controls named `Btn_StartScreenCapture` and `Btn_StopScreenCapture`. Users **start** or **stop** <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> using these two buttons as shown in the figure below:

#### Join a channel and publish the screen sharing stream

Refer to the following steps to join a channel and publish a screen sharing stream:

1. In **Bind UIEvent**, bind the UI event of clicking the **Start Screen Share** button. Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the `Btn_StartScreenShare` button control and the `OnStartScreenShareClicked` callback functions respectively. This callback is triggered when the user clicks the **Start Screen Share** button as shown in the following figure:

    ![Bind UI Start](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-android-ios-bind-ui-start.png)

1. Create and implement the `OnStartScreenShareClicked` callback. When a button click triggers this callback, execute the following flow:

    1. Call the **Stop Screen Capture** method to pause the ongoing <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> process.
    1. Call **Start Screen Capture** method to start screen capture, and check **Capture Audio** and **Capture Video** in **Make ScreenCaptureParameters2** to capture system audio and screen video.
    1. Call **Join Channel** to join the channel and configure the following parameters in **Make ChannelMediaOptions** to publish the screen-captured video stream to the channel:
        - Set **Publish Camera Track** to `AGORA FALSE VALUE` to cancel publishing the video stream collected by the camera.
        - Set **Publish Screen Capture Video** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the screen-captured video stream.
        - Set **Publish Screen Capture Audio** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish the screen-captured audio stream.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Video** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all video streams.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Audio** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all audio streams.
        - Check **Client Role Type Set Value** and set **Client Role Type** to `CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER` or `CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE` to set the user role as host or audience.
        - Check **Channel Profile Set Value** and set **Channel Profile** to `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING` to set the channel scene to live broadcast scene as shown below:

#### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />

Follow the steps below to stop screen capture:

1. In **Bind UIEvent**, bind the UI event of clicking the **Stop Screen Sharing** button. Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the `Btn_StopScreenShare` button control and the `OnStopScreenShareClicked` callback function respectively. This callback is triggered when the user clicks the **Stop Screen Share** button. 

    ![Bind UI Event for Stop Button Click](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-android-ios-bind-ui-stop.png)

1. Create and implement the `OnStopScreenShareClicked` callback. When a button click triggers this callback, **Stop Screen Capture** is called to stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> as shown in the following image:

    ![Bind UI Event for Stop Button Click](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-android-ios-stop.png)

### Windows and macOS platforms

This subsection describes how to start and stop screen capture on Windows and macOS mobile platforms.

#### Create the user interface

Refer to the following steps to create a UMG:

1. Create a **ComboBoxString** (drop-down list box) control named `CBS_DisplayID` for the user to select the screen or window to share from a drop-down list.

1. Create two **Button** controls named `Btn_StartScreenCapture` and `Btn_StopScreenCapture`, for the user to start or stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />. 

    ![Windows macOS UMG](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-umg.png)

#### Add the basic process

In **EventGraph**, add and connect the event nodes required for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> as shown in the following diagram:

![EventGraph](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-event-graph.png)

The main nodes are as follows:

| Node | Description |
|:---|:---------------|
| Get Screen Display Id | After initializing the <Vg k="ENGINE" />, get information about the shareable screens and windows. Use this information to set the options and indexes in the drop-down lists. |
| Init Default Screen Capture Config | Prepare the parameter configuration for <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> and save the configuration for later use. |

#### Get available screens and windows

Follow the steps below to obtain and add available screens and windows:

1. In **Get Screen Display Id**, refer to the following steps to get the currently available screen and window resources and add them to the options in the drop-down list:

    1. Call the **Get Screen Capture Sources** method to return a list of shareable screens and windows, and call **Get Count** to get the number of shareable screens and windows, as shown in the following figure:

        ![Get Screen Capture Sources](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-get-screen-capture-sources.png)

    1. Traverse the list, call **Get Source Info** to get information about a specific screen or window, and add the **Source Name** to each of the options in the drop-down list for the users to choose from. Call **Release** to release the list of shareable screens and windows. Refer to the following figure:

        ![Get Screen Capture Sources](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-get-source-info.png)

1. In **Bind UIEvent**, bind the UI event of the dropdown list selection change. Create a **Bind Event to On Selection Changed** node that connects the `CBS_DisplayID` drop-down list control and the `OnCBDisplayIDSelectionChanged` callback function, respectively. This callback is triggered when the user selects the specified screen or window in the drop-down list as shown in the following figure:

    ![Bind Event On Selection Changed](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-bind-event-to-on-selection-changed.png)

1. Create and implement the `OnCBDisplayIDSelectionChanged` callback. When an option change triggers this callback, it looks up the index of the option and sets the option by index as shown below:

    ![OnCBDisplayIDSelectionChanged](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-on-cbdisplay-id-selection-changed.png)

#### Configure <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters

In **Init Default Screen Capture Config**, configure <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> parameters such as **Dimensions**, **Frame Rate**, and **Bitrate**. Make advanced configurations as follows:

- **Screen Stroke**: Check **Enable High Light** and set **High Light Width** and **High Light Color** to specify the stroke width and color. The SDK strokes the shared screen or window according to your settings.

- **Shield Window**: Set **Exclude Window List** to the list of windows you want to shield. When you subsequently call **Start Screen Capture by Display Id**, the specified window is shielded.

Save this configuration for subsequent use when starting screen capture. Refer to the following figure:

![Save Screen Share Config](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-save-config.png)

#### Join a channel and publish a screen sharing stream

1. In **Bind UIEvent**, bind the event of clicking the **Start Screen Share** button. Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the `Btn_StartScreenShare` button control and the `OnStartScreenShareClicked` callback functions, respectively. This callback is triggered when the user clicks the **Start Screen Share** button as shown below:

    ![Bind Event to On Clicked](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-create-bind-event-to-on-clicked-node.png)

1. Create and implement the `OnStartScreenShareClicked` callback. When the callback is triggered, the following process is executed:
    1. Call the **Stop Screen Capture** method to pause the ongoing <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> process.
    1. Based on the list of available screens and windows saved in the previous steps, find the element that corresponds to the option and determine whether the option is a `ScreenCaptureSourceType_Screen` (screen) or a `ScreenCaptureSourceType_Window` (window) by using the **Type** in the element.

        ![OnStartScreenShareClicked callback](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-on-start-screen-share-clicked.png)

    1. If the shared target is a screen, call **Start Screen Capture by Display Id** to pass in the screen ID and the parameter configuration saved in the previous steps to start capturing the video stream of the specified screen. If the shared target is a window, call **Start Screen Capture by Window Id** to pass in the window ID and the parameter configuration to start capturing the video stream of the specified window.  To share a specific region of a screen or window, set the **Region Rect** parameter to the position of the region you want to share relative to the entire screen or window.
    1. Call **Join Channel** to join the channel and configure the following parameters in **Make ChannelMediaOptions** to publish the captured screen sharing stream:
        - Set **Publish Camera Track** to `AGORA FALSE VALUE` to cancel publishing camera-captured video streams.
        - Set **Publish Screen Track** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to publish screen-captured video streams.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Video** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all video streams.
        - Set **Auto Subscribe Audio** to `AGORA TRUE VALUE` to automatically subscribe to all audio streams.
        - Check **Client Role Type Set Value** and set **Client Role Type** to `CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER` or `CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE` to set the user's role as anchor or audience.
        - Check **Channel Profile Set Value** and set **Channel Profile** to `CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING`.

        ![Call Join Channel](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-call-join-channel.png)

#### Stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> and leave the channel

1. In **Bind UIEvent**, bind the event of clicking the **Stop Screen Sharing** button. Create a **Bind Event to On Clicked** node that connects the `Btn_StopScreenShare` button control and the `OnStopScreenShareClicked` callback functions respectively. This callback is triggered when the user clicks the **Stop Screen Share** button. Refer to the following figure:

    ![Bind UI Event of Stop Button Click](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-bind-ui-stop.png)

1. Create and implement the `OnStopScreenShareClicked` callback. When a button click triggers this callback, **Stop Screen Capture** is called to stop <Vg k="SCR_SHR" /> as shown below:

    ![OnStopScreenShareClicked callback](/images/rtc-sdk/screen-sharing-blueprint-windows-macos-on-stop-screen-share-clicked.png)

### Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- The video unit price for a screen-shared stream is based on the **video resolution** you set in `FScreenCaptureParameters`. If you do not pass dimensions in `FScreenCaptureParameters`, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> bills at the default resolution of 1920 x 1080 (2,073,600). See [Pricing](../overview/pricing) for details.

#### Android and iOS platforms

- Before starting <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />, call the `SetAudioScenario` method and set the **audio scenario** to `AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING` (high sound quality scenario) to improve the success rate of capturing system audio during <Vg k="SCR_SHR" />.
