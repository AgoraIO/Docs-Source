1.  In Unreal Studio, click **Play**. A moment later you see the <Vpl k = "CLIENT"/> running on your device.

1.  Press **Join** to see the video feed from the web app.

    You see the local video in the local view and remote video in the remote view. This means your <Vpl k = "CLIENT"/> is rendering the capture video frames that you receive in the following callbacks:

    -  `onRenderVideoFrame`: Gets the remote user video frame data.
    -  `onCaptureVideoFrame`: Gets the captured video frame data.

1.  Test processing of raw audio data.

    Edit the `IAudioFrameObserver` callbacks by adding code that processes the raw audio data you receive in the following callbacks:

    -   `onRecordAudioFrame`: Gets the captured audio frame data

    -   `onPlaybackAudioFrame`: Gets the audio frame for playback
