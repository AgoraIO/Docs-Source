Customer satisfaction with your <Vg k="VIDEO"/> integrated <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> depends on the quality of video and audio it provides. The sharpness, smoothness, and overall quality of the video is directly linked to the frame rate, bitrate, and other video encoder settings. Choosing improper settings can result in poor video quality. Conversely, if the settings are too demanding, the available bandwidth quickly gets choked, leading to a suboptimal experience for your users.

This page guides you on configuring the video encoder settings to ensure optimal video quality in your <Vpd k="NAME" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

In <Vg k="VSDK"/> you can set the video dimensions, framerate, bitrate, orientation mode, and mirror mode by specifying a video profile. You can also set the degradation preference to specify how video quality is degraded under suboptimal network conditions.

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">

### Resolution, frame rate, and bitrate

* **Resolution**: Defines the video encoding resolution in pixels. The default value is `960 × 540`. Higher resolutions generally result in better video clarity. Note that this parameter does not determine the final video orientation. Refer to [Video orientation](#video-orientation) for setting the video output orientation.

* **Frame rate**: Represents the number of frames encoded per second (FPS). The default value is `15` FPS. A higher frame rate contributes to smoother video playback. For use-cases demanding high video smoothness, consider setting this parameter to `20` or `25`. It is advised not to exceed a frame rate of `30`.

* **Bitrate**: Indicates the video encoding bitrate in Kbps. The default mode is set to *Standard Bitrate*. In this mode, the <Vg k="VSDK"/> dynamically sets an appropriate bitrate based on the channel profile, resolution, and frame rate.

To find a suitable bitrate for a given combination of dimensions and framerate, refer to the [Video profiles table](#video-profiles-table).

To achieve high video quality, it's crucial to maintain a balanced relationship between resolution, bitrate, and frame rate. Higher resolutions necessitate a higher bitrate. If the bitrate is fixed, an excessively high frame rate can reduce the resolution.

The configured parameter settings represent maximum values under ideal conditions. In cases where video quality cannot reach the set maximum values due to network constraints or other factors, the actual values are adjusted to match the specified maximum resolution, frame rate, or bitrate as closely as possible.

Video encoder configuration settings may affect billing. If settings are lowered due to adaptation, billing is based on the video resolution actually subscribed to by the user. For details, see [Pricing](../overview/pricing).

### Recommended video settings

The recommended video settings vary by use-case. For example, in a one-to-one online class, the video windows of the teacher and student are both large, which calls for higher resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. However, in a one-to-many online class, the video windows are smaller. You can set lower resolution, frame rate, and bitrate to accommodate bandwidth limitations.

Use the following as a guide when configuring video settings for these use-cases:

- One-to-one video call:

    - Resolution: 320 x 240; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 200 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 640 x 360; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 400 Kbps.

- One-to-many video call:

    - Resolution: 160 x 120; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 65 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 320 x 180; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 140 Kbps.
    - Resolution: 320 x 240; Frame rate: 15 fps; Bitrate: 200 Kbps.

### Video orientation

The way video is displayed on the playing device depends on `orientationMode` used on the encoding device, orientation of the capturing device, orientation of the playing device, and whether screen rotation is enabled on the playing device. On the capturing device, you can set the `orientationMode` to:

* **Adaptive**

    In the this mode, the direction of the video output is consistent with the direction of the captured video. The receiving end rotates the video based on the received video rotation information. This mode is suitable for use-cases where the receiving end can adjust the video direction. No matter which mode you choose, <Vpd k="SDK" /> ensures that the relative position of the video and the status bar is always consistent at the capturing end and playback end.

* **Fixed Portrait**

    In this mode, the output video is always in landscape mode relative to the Status Bar. If the captured video is in portrait mode, the video encoder crops it. This method is suitable for situations where the receiving end cannot process the rotation information.

* **Fixed Landscape**

    In this mode, the output video is always in portrait mode relative to the Status Bar. If the captured video is in landscape mode, the video encoder crops it. This method is suitable for situations where the receiving end cannot process the rotation information.

The following images illustrate different combinations.

### Degradation preference

To enhance the video experience for users in low-bandwidth conditions, the <Vg k="VSDK"/> offers the `degradationPreference` parameter. This parameter allows you to set your preference for video encoding downgrade when bandwidth is limited.

### Mirror mode

By default, Video SDK does not mirror the video during encoding. You use the `mirrorMode` parameter to decide whether to mirror the video that remote users see.

### Minimum encoding frame rate

For specific requirements related to video quality or transmission frame rate, adjust the minimum encoding frame rate parameter `minBitrate`. It sets the minimum video encoding bitrate in Kbps. The <Vg k ="VSDK"/> performs bitrate adaptation based on network conditions. Increasing this parameter beyond the default value compels the video encoder to produce high-quality images, but it may lead to increased packet loss, affecting video playback smoothness.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">The default value of `minBitrate` meets the requirements of most real-time use-cases. For general use-cases, <Vg k= "COMPANY"/> suggests not changing the default value.</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
After you set the resolution and frame rate, the SDK automatically sets the corresponding bitrate. Agora does not recommend that you modify the bitrate manually.
