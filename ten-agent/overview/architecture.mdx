The system includes multiple components that work together to provide a seamless experience. The system flow is illustrated below:

The main components are:

- **TEN Agent app**: The core application that orchestrates extensions and manages data flow between them. It runs as a background process. Based on the graph configuration, the agent starts the necessary extensions and coordinates the data flow.
- **Front-end UI**: A web-based interface for interacting with the agent. Users can configure the agent, start or stop it, and engage in conversations.
- **Web server**: A simple Go-based server that handles HTTP requests. It starts or stops agent processes and passes parameters such as `graph_name` to determine which graph to use.
