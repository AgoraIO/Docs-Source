Stream Channels are based on the room model. In a stream channel, users join a topic in order to send message to all users subscribed to that topic.  <Vg k="MESS"/> enables each user to join up to one hundred channels at the same time. Each channel can have unlimited topics and up to 128 simultaneous users. Topics have a higher message transmission rate, greater message concurrency capability, and enable synchronous transmission of audio and video data. You use topics for Metaverse, AR/VR, interactive games, real-time collaboration, and parallel manipulation <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s.

For information about message channels where users communicate using a pub-sub model, see the [Message channel quickstart](/en/signaling/develop/get-started-sdk).

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the stream channel workflow:

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

- [Raised a support ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to activate the Stream Channel capability. The <Vg k="COMPANY" /> support team confirms activation through a ticket update.

## Project setup

<Setup />


By default Signaling SDK is installed automatically. However, you can also [Install Signaling SDK manually](../reference/downloads#through-the-agora-website).

## Implement communication in a stream channel
