Agora Cloud Proxy is a feature of Agora Voice and Video SDKs. It ensures reliable audio and video connectivity for end users when they connect from restricted network environments.

The following figure illustrates how Agora Cloud Proxy works:

![](/images/video-sdk/cloud-proxy-tech.svg)

1. The SDK initiates a request to <Vg k="CP" />.
1. <Vg k="CP" /> returns the corresponding proxy information.
1. Agora SDK sends data to <Vg k="CP" />. <Vg k="CP" /> receives the data and transmits it to Agora SD-RTN™.
1. Agora SD-RTN™ returns data to <Vg k="CP" />. <Vg k="CP" /> receives the data and sends it to the SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling <Vg k="CP" />, make sure that you have:

1. [Integrated the SDK](../get-started/integrate-sdk) and prepared the development environment.
1. Contacted [Agora support](mailto:support@agora.io) and provided the following information to request <Vg k="CP" />:
    - App ID
    - <Vg k="CP" /> service usage area
    - Concurrency scale
    - Network operator and other relevant information

## Implementation

To enable Force UDP or Force TCP <Vg k="CP" /> mode, take the following steps:

<ProjectImplement/>

3. Test the audio and video call functionality.

#### Considerations

- Agora recommends that you enable <Vg k="CP" /> before connecting to the channel or after disconnecting from the channel.
- Force UDP <Vg k="CP" /> mode does not support pushing streams to the CDN or relaying streams across channels.
