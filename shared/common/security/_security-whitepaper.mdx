Securing access to your environment starts with identity and access controls. Agora provides you with a solution to ensure that only authorized people can access your services and resources. The Agora Console is a role-based access control tool that you utilize to restrict access based on "the-need-to-know" principle. The console is an interactive interface where you can easily create accounts, revoke members and assign roles and permissions. This tool can assist you to enforce your security policies.

Furthermore, Agora provides static key, dynamic key, and hybrid authentication methods to secure the communication channels in different scenarios.

#### Data protection and encryption

At Agora, you choose how your content is secured. We offer you various options for your content in transit and provide you with full control of your own encryption keys. There features include:
- Agora Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide built-in encryption algorithm including AES-128 and AES-256 to protect all data transmitted between the end users and Agora services.
- We also provide you with the choice to use your own encryption algorithm to protect users’ media stream during real-time engagement. The encryption key is completely under your control.
- The communication between the end users and Agora network (that is, SD-RTN™) is protected by encrypted transmission protocols such as the Agora Private Transmission Protocol, Transport Layer Security (TLS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS). 

#### Data storage

Agora offers our customers the ability to record the real-time communication with Agora On-premise Recording SDK and Agora Cloud Recording SDK. The recording files can be stored on the users’ local device or can be stored in a designated cloud storage service chosen by our customers. The local recordings or cloud recordings can be further encrypted through any encryption form of your choosing.
Agora does not store any streaming data or user data except for caching for transmission purpose. The cached streaming data of users will be immediately released after the service.
Data centers hosting Agora services are maintained by certified and industry-leading cloud service providers, offering state-of-the-art physical protection for the servers and infrastructure that comprise the Agora environment.

#### Network security

The production environment, where all our customers data and functional servers reside, are completely separated from our internal organization network including the development and testing environments. This guarantees that all our customers data will stay in the production environment and never be used for development or testing purposes. 

Access to the Agora production and non-production network is minimized to the greatest extent. Agora also implements network segmentation in production network based on various factors such as the type of business, the criticality of data, and the potential risks, to secure the sensitive customer data.

*DDoS prevention*
Agora regularly scans our core network nodes in the production environment to check and clear potential security vulnerabilities Anti-DDoS firewalls are configured in each core cloud data center for protection. With more than two hundred distributed data centers around the world, Agora can guarantee you with sufficient capabilities and resources to minimize the impact of DDoS attacks and ensure high-availability of real-time video and audio anywhere around the globe.

*Monitoring, logging and analysis*
Agora continuously monitors and analyzes log events to gain a comprehensive view of the security state of our production environment. The logging covers both successful and unsuccessful security events, with an emphasis on the event data of critical infrastructure. 

To provide customers with better visibility and security insights, Agora Analytics is made available to consumers as a tracking and analysis tool. This tool enables customers to efficiently locate quality issues and identify root causes for a better end user experience. 

The tool contains the Real-Time Alarm function, which enables you to monitor call quality and informs you in real time when the user’s communication experience is below expectation. With Real-Time Alarm, you can undertake the following actions in real time:
- Monitor users who are having poor communication experience.
- Identify abnormalities, analyze quality factor, and locate the source of an abnormal issue.

Agora Network Geo-Fencing establishes a virtual boundary within the SD-RTN<sup>TM</sup> and you have the choice to restricted your network traffic in one or more designated region(s). 

*Network redundancy*
Agora has more than 200 data centers POPs (Points of Presence) across the world, covering the United States, Europe, China, Japan, India and Asia Pacific and other areas. The POPs in the SD-TRN network adopt the full mesh topology with superior routing capabilities. This is to ensure that the network services are not interrupted due to a single point of failure. The POPs build fault tolerance and disaster recovery capability of Agora service across the regions. 

POPs also measure the performance of every possible path through the global network to find the “optimized” paths to ensure high data packet delivery success rate within the smallest time window.
