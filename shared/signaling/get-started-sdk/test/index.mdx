In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID. You create a token for each
user in the channel, each user must log in from different instance of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
To test <Vg k="MESS" />, you run 2 or more instances of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> . When you call `login` using <Vg
k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same as you used to create the token.

For each user in your tests:

1. **[Generate a <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token)**.
