This guide shows you how to obtain a token from your token server, use it to join a channel, and renew the token when it is about to expire.

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel or wildcard channels.

When a user attempts to connect to an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> reads the information stored in the token to validate the request.

The following figure shows the call flow you implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have:

* Implemented the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

* Deployed a token server using either of the following guides:

    - [Deploy a token server](../token-authentication/deploy-token-server)
    - [Deploy the middleware server](../token-authentication/middleware-token-server)

## Implement basic authentication

This section shows you how to implement basic authentication by acquiring a token and using it to join a channel. To ensure the security of your business, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> recommends that you authenticate every client that joins a channel.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
The user ID and channel name used to join a channel must be consistent with the values used to generate the token.
