When the connection state changes, <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends an `onConnectionStateChanged` callback. This section shows you how to use the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback to monitor changes in the connection state.

Use the following code in your `IRtcEngineEventHandler` to log the connection state changes and the reason for the state change.

``` java
public void onConnectionStateChanged(int state, int reason) {
    super.onConnectionStateChanged(state, reason);
    Log.i(TAG, "onConnectionStateChanged->" + ", state->" + state 
        + ", reason->" + reason);
}
```

The `state` parameter in `onConnectionStateChanged` reports the current connection state. The `reason` parameter indicates why the connection state changed to help you troubleshoot your network. See [State description and troubleshooting](#state-description-and-troubleshooting).
