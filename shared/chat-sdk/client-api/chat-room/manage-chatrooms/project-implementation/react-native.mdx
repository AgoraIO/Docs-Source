### Create a chat room

Only the [app super admin](/agora-chat/restful-api/chatroom-management/manage-chatroom-admins) can call `createChatRoom` to create a chat room and set the chat room attributes such as the chat room name, description, and maximum number of members. Once a chat room is created, the super admin automatically becomes the chat room owner.

The following code sample shows how to create a chat room:

```typescript
// The chat room name can be a maximum of 128 characters.
const subject = "";
// The chat room description can be a maximum of 512 characters.
const desc = "this is room description.";
// The welcome message.
const welcomeMsg = "welcome to you.";
// The members to add.
const members = ["Tom", "Json"];
// The maximum number of members.
const maxCount = 10000;
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.createChatRoom(subject, desc, welcomeMsg, members, maxCount)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("get room success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get room fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Destroy a chat room

Only the chat room owner can call `destroyChatRoom` to disband a chat room. Once a chat room is disbanded, all chat room members receive the `onChatRoomDestroyed` callback and are immediately removed from the chat room.

The following code sample shows how to destroy a chat room:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.destroyChatRoom(roomId)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("destroy room success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("destroy room fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Join a chat room

Refer to the following steps to join a chat room:

1. Call [`FetchPublicRoomsFromServer`](#retrieve) to retrieve the list of chat rooms from the server and locate the ID of the chat room that you want to join.

2. Call `joinChatRoom` to pass in the chat room ID and join the specified chat room. Once a user joins a chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `onMemberJoined` callback.

The following code sample shows how to join a chat room:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.joinChatRoom(roomId)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("join room success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("join room fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Leave a chat room


All chat room members can call `leaveChatRoom` to leave the specified chat room. Once a member leaves the chat room, all the other chat room members receive the `onMemberExited` callback.

**Note**: Unlike chat group owners (who cannot leave their groups), a chat room owner can leave a chat room. After re-entering the chat room, this user remains the chat room owner.

The following code sample shows how to leave a chat room:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.leaveChatRoom(roomId)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("join room success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("join room fail.", reason);
  });
```

By default, after a user leaves a chat room, the Chat SDK removes all chat room messages on the local device. If you do not want these messages removed, set `ChatOptions#deleteMessagesAsExitChatRoom` to `false` when initializing the SDK.

The following code sample shows how to retain the chat room messages after leaving a chat room:

```typescript
ChatOptions options = new ChatOptions();
options.deleteMessagesAsExitChatRoom = false;
```

### Retrieve the chat room attributes

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer` to retrieve the attributes of the a chat room, including the chat room ID, name, description, announcements, owner, admin list, maximum number of members, and whether all members are muted.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room attributes:

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer(roomId)
  .then((info) => {
    console.log("get room info success.", info);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get room info fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Retrieve the chat room list from the server<a name="retrieve"></a>

Users can call `FetchPublicRoomsFromServer` to retrieve the chat room list from the server. You can retrieve a maximum of `1,000` chat rooms at each call.

```typescript
// You can set the value of `pageSize` to a maximum of 1000.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .roomManager.fetchPublicChatRoomsFromServer(pageNum, pageSize)
  .then((rooms) => {
    console.log("get room success.", rooms);
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log("get room fail.", reason);
  });
```

### Listen for chat room events

To monitor the chat room events, you can listen for the callbacks in the `ChatRoomEventListener` class and add app logics accordingly. If you want to stop listening for the callback, make sure that you remove the listener to prevent memory leakage.

The following code sample shows how to add and remove the chat room listener:

```typescript
// Inherits and implements the ChatRoomEventListener class.
const roomListener: ChatRoomEventListener = new (class
  implements ChatRoomEventListener
{
  that: QuickTestScreenBase<S, SL>;
  constructor(parent: QuickTestScreenBase<S, SL>) {
    this.that = parent;
  }
  // Occurs when a chat room instance is destroyed.
  onChatRoomDestroyed(params: {
    roomId: string;
    roomName?: string | undefined;
  }): void {
    console.log(`onChatRoomDestroyed:`, params.roomId, params.roomName);
  }
  // Occurs when a user joins a chat room.
  onMemberJoined(params: { roomId: string; participant: string }): void {
    console.log(`onMemberJoined:`, params.roomId, params.participant);
  }
  // Occurs when a member leaves a chat room.
  onMemberExited(params: {
    roomId: string;
    participant: string;
    roomName?: string | undefined;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onMemberJoined:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.participant,
      params.roomName
    );
  }
  // Occurs when a member is removed from a chat room.
  onRemoved(params: {
    roomId: string;
    participant?: string | undefined;
    roomName?: string | undefined;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onRemoved:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.participant,
      params.roomName
    );
  }
  // Occurs when a member is added to the chat room mute list.
  onMuteListAdded(params: {
    roomId: string;
    mutes: string[];
    expireTime?: string | undefined;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onMuteListAdded:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.mutes,
      params.expireTime
    );
  }
  // Occurs when a member is removed from the chat room mute list.
  onMuteListRemoved(params: { roomId: string; mutes: string[] }): void {
    console.log(`onMuteListRemoved:`, params.roomId, params.mutes);
  }
  // Occurs when a member is promoted to a chat room admin.
  onAdminAdded(params: { roomId: string; admin: string }): void {
    console.log(`onAdminAdded:`, params.roomId, params.admin);
  }
  // Occurs when an admin is demoted to a chat room member.
  onAdminRemoved(params: { roomId: string; admin: string }): void {
    console.log(`onAdminRemoved:`, params.roomId, params.admin);
  }
  // Occurs when the chat room ownership is transferred.
  onOwnerChanged(params: {
    roomId: string;
    newOwner: string;
    oldOwner: string;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onOwnerChanged:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.newOwner,
      params.oldOwner
    );
  }
  // Occurs when the chat room announcements are updated.
  onAnnouncementChanged(params: {
    roomId: string;
    announcement: string;
  }): void {
    console.log(`onAnnouncementChanged:`, params.roomId, params.announcement);
  }
  // Occurs when one or more chat room members are added to the allow list.
  onAllowListAdded(params: { roomId: string; members: string[] }): void {
    console.log(`onAllowListAdded:`, params.roomId, params.members);
  }
  // Occurs when one or more chat room members are removed from the allow list.
  onAllowListRemoved(params: { roomId: string; members: string[] }): void {
    console.log(`onAllowListRemoved:`, params.roomId, params.members);
  }
  // Occurs when all members in the chat room are muted or unmuted.
  onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged(params: {
    roomId: string;
    isAllMuted: boolean;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onAllChatRoomMemberMuteStateChanged:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.isAllMuted ? "true" : "false"
    );
  }
  // Occurs when the chat room specifications change. All chat room members receive this event.
  onSpecificationChanged(room: ChatRoom): void {
    console.log(`onSpecificationChanged:`, room);
  }
  // Occurs when the custom chat room attributes (key-value) are updated.
  onAttributesUpdated(params: {
    roomId: string;
    attributes: Map<string, string>;
    from: string;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onAttributesUpdated:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.attributes,
      params.from
    );
  }
  // Occurs when the custom chat room attributes (key-value) are removed.
  onAttributesRemoved(params: {
    roomId: string;
    removedKeys: Array<string>;
    from: string;
  }): void {
    console.log(
      `onAttributesRemoved:`,
      params.roomId,
      params.removedKeys,
      params.from
    );
  }
})(this);

// Removes the chat room listener.
ChatClient.getInstance().roomManager.removeAllRoomListener();
// Adds the chat room listener.
ChatClient.getInstance().roomManager.addRoomListener(roomListener);
```

### Update the chat room member count in real time

If many members join or leave a chat room in a very short time, you can update the chat room member count in real time:

1. When a user joins a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `ChatRoomEventListener#onMemberJoined` event. When a member leaves or is removed from a chat room, other members in the chat room receive the `ChatRoomEventListener#onMemberExited` event.

1. After the event is received, you can call the `fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer` method to get local details of the chat room, including the current number of members in the chat room.

```typescript
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.fetchChatRoomInfoFromServer(
    roomId // Room ID
  )
  .then((res) => {
    // Operation successful, room information obtained
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // An error occurred
  });

```
