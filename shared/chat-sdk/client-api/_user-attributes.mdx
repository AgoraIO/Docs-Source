After joining a Chat channel, a user can update information such as the nickname, avatar, age, and mobile phone number as needed. These are known as user attributes.

This page shows how to use the Chat SDK to implement managing user attributes.

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>User attributes are stored on the Chat server. If you have security concerns, Agora recommends that you manage user attributes yourself.</li><li>To ensure information security, app users can only modify their own user attributes. Only app admins can modify the user attributes of other users.</li></ul></div>

## Understand the tech
