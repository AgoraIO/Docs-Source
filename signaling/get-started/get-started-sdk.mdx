You integrate <Vg k="SIG" /> in order to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling and
synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You also use <Vg k="SIG" /> to
enhance the user experience for <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="AUDIO" />,  <Vg k="ILS" />, and <Vg k="BS" />.

This page shows you how to easily integrate <Vg k="SIG" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

To start a session, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

Add diagram here

- *Retrieve tokens for each user*:

    A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates the user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel.
    In this guide you retrieve a temporary token from Token Generator. To understand how to create an authentication
    server for development purposes, see
    [Implement the authentication workflow](../get-started/authentication-workflow). To develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

- *Join a channel*:

    Call methods to login and join a channel for either.

    - Pub-Sub messaging:

      1.  Client A sends a message to client B.
      1.  Client B receives the peer message.


    - Streaming messaging

      1.  Client A creates a channel and joins the channel.
      1.  Clients B and C join the channel created by Client A.
      1.  Client A sends a message to the channel.
      1.  Clients B and C receive the message.

- *Listen for events*:
    Bla bla bla

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />

<GetStartedSDK  product="Signaling" company="Agora" sdk="Signaling SDK" client="app" />

## Next steps

Generating a token manually is not a practical solution in a production context. [Secure authentication with tokens](../develop/authentication-workflow) shows you how to use Signaling with a token that you retrieve from your server.
