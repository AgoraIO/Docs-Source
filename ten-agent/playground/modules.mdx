2. Select a graph type (e.g. Voice Agent, Realtime Agent).
3. Click on the Button to the right of the graph selection to open the module selection.

## Types of modules

The <Vpd k="NAME" /> Playground supports the following module types:

- **Speech-to-text (STT)**: Converts spoken language to text.
- **Text-to-speech (TTS)**: Converts text to spoken language.
- **Large language model (LLM)**: Generates text responses based on input and context.
- **Voice-to-voice model (V2V)**: Generates voice output influenced by voice input.
- **Tool (TOOL)**: Provides utilities for the agent. Tools can be bound to either an LLM or V2V module.

## Bind Tool Modules

You can bind tool modules to `LLM` or `V2V` modules in the <Vpd k="NAME" /> Playground.
Tool can provide additional capabilities to the agent, such as weather check, news update, etc. You can also write your own tool extension if needed.
