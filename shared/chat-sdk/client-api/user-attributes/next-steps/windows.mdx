### Manage user avatar

The Chat SDK only supports storing the URL address of the avatar file rather than the file itself. To manage user avatars, you need to use a third-party file storage service.

To implement user avatar management in your app, take the following steps:

1. Upload the avator file to the third-party file storage service. Once the file is successfully uploaded, you get a URL address of the avatar file.
2. Set the `avatarUrl` parameter in user attributes as the URL address of the avatar file.
3. To display the avatar, call `FetchUserInfoByUserId` to retrieve the URL of the avatar file, and then render the image on the local UI.

### Create and send a namecard using user attributes

Namecard messages are custom messages that include the user ID, nickname, avator, email address, and phone number of the specified user. To create and send a namecard, take the following steps:

1. Create a custom message and set the `event` of the custom message as `userCard`.
2. Add `userID`, `nickname`, and `avatarUrl` as fileds in `ext`. Send the custom message.

Followings are the sample code for creating and sending a namecard message:

```csharp
string event = "userCard";
Dictionary<string, string> adict = new Dictionary<string, string>();
adict.Add("userId", userInfo.userId);
adict.Add("nickname", userInfo. nickname);
adict.Add("avatarUrl", userInfo.avatarUrl);
// You can add more fields.

// Create a custom message.
Message msg = Message.CreateCustomSendMessage(toChatUsername, event, adict);

// Send the message.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.SendMessage(ref msg, new CallBack(
   onSuccess: () => {
      Debug.Log($"{msg.MsgId}发送成功");
   },
   onError: (code, desc) => {
      Debug.Log($"{msg.MsgId}发送失败，errCode={code}, errDesc={desc}");
   }
));
```
