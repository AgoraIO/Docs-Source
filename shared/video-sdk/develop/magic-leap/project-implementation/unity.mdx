### Implement the user interface

For a basic <Vpl k="NAME" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you need:

* One view for local video

* One view for remote video

* Buttons so the user can join or leave a channel

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
* One selector to choose to join as the host or the audience
</ProductWrapper>

To implement this user interface, in your Unity project:

1. **Set up a new scene in your game**

    To add a new scene in your game, do the following:
    1. Create a new Scene **File** > **New Scene**.
    1. Delete the **Main Camera** from the scene.
    1. Find the **Main Camera** prefab in `Packages/Magic Leap SDK/Tools/Prefabs` and drag it into the scene.

1. **Add a canvas to the scene**
    
    To add a canvas in your game and lock it to the head pose, do the following:
    
    1. Go to **GameObject** > **3D Object** > **Canvas**. A canvas appears in your scene.
        
        If you canâ€™t see the canvas clearly, in Unity, zoom out and rotate the scene.

    1. In **Inspector**, from the **Render Mode** drop down, select **World Space**.

    1. Drag **Main Camera** from the scene hierarchy to **Event Camera** in **Inspector**.

    1. In **Inspector**, set the cube transform properties to:

        * **Scale** at 0.01, 0.01, 0.01
        * **Width** at `160`
        * **Height** at `120`

    1. To lock the canvas to the head pose, go to `Assets/MagicLeap/Core/Scripts` and drag `MLHeadposeCanvasBehavior.cs` to **Canvas**. 

1. **Add the join and leave buttons**

    To create buttons that you access programmatically to implement the <Vpd k="NAME" /> workflow:

    1. Right-click **Canvas**, then click **UI** > **Button - TextMeshPro**. A button appears in the **Scene** Canvas.

    2. In **Inspector**, rename **Button** to **Leave**, then set the button transform properties to:

        * **Scale** at `0.25`, `0.25`, `0.25`
        * **Position** at `58.1`, `-52.5`, `0`

    3. Select the **Text(TMP)** sub-item of **Leave**, and in **Inspector**, change **Text** to *Leave*.

    4. Use the same procedure to create a button called **Join** with a **Text(TMP)** sub-item where its **Text** says *Join*.

    5. To shift **Join** to the left of the Canvas, in **Inspector** set the button properties to:

        * **Scale** at `0.25`, `0.25`, `0.25`
        * **Position** at `-55.1`, `-52.5`, `0`

2. **Add the local and remote video views**

    To create raw images using <Vpl k="NAME" /> that you access programmatically to display video streams on:

    1. For local video, right-click **Canvas**, then click **UI** > **Raw Image**.

    2. In **Inspector**, rename **RawImage** to `LocalView`, and change the image transform properties to:
    
        * **Scale** at `0.5`, `0.5`, `0.5`
        * **Position** at `-44.5`, `0`, `0`

    3. For remote video, use the same procedure to create a **RawImage** called `RemoteView` with the following transform properties:
    
        * **Scale** at `0.5`, `0.5`, `0.5`
        * **Position** at `44.5`, `0`, `0`

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
3. **Enable the user to join a channel as the host or the audience**

    1. In your <Vpl k="NAME" /> project, right-click **Canvas**, then click **UI** > **Toggle**. A toggle button appears in the canvas.

    2. In **Inspector**, rename **Toggle** to "Broadcaster", then change the toggle transform properties to:

        * **Scale** at `0.5`, `0.5`, `0.5`
        * **Position** at `22.9`, `-39.9`, `0`

    3. Select the **Label** sub-item of **Broadcaster**, in **Inspector**, change the **Label** to "Host".

    4. Use the same procedure to create a **Toggle** called **Audience** with a **Label** sub-item which says **Audience**. Then, in **Inspector** use the following transform properties:

        * **Scale** at `0.5`, `0.5`, `0.5`
        * **Position** at `22.9`, `-30.9`, `0`
