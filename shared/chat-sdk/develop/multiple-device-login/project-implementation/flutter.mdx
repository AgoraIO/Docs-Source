### Get the login ID list of other logged-in devices of the current user

Call `getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform` to get the login ID list of other logged-in devices, and then select the target login ID as the message recipient to send a message to the specified device.

```dart
List<String> ids =
    await ChatClient.getInstance.contactManager.getSelfIdsOnOtherPlatform();

// Select a login ID as the message sender.
String toChatUserId = ids.first;

// Create a text message, content is the message text, toChatUserId passes in the login ID as the message sender.
final msg = ChatMessage.createTxtSendMessage(
    targetId: toChatUserId, content: 'content');
// Send a message.
ChatClient.getInstance.chatManager.sendMessage(msg);
```

### Get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account

Call `fetchLoggedInDevices` to get the list of online logged-in devices for the specified account from the server by passing in the user ID and user token.

```dart
List<ChatDeviceInfo> deviceInfos =
        await ChatClient.getInstance.fetchLoggedInDevices(
    userId: 'userId',
    pwdOrToken: 'token',
    isPwd: false,
);
```

### Force the specified account to log off from a single device

Call `kickDevice` to pass in the user ID and user token to kick the specified account off from a single logged-in device. Before calling this method, obtain the device ID through the `ChatClient#fetchLoggedInDevices` and `DeviceInfo#getResource` methods.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">You can also use this interface without logging in.</Admonition>

```dart
// userId: user ID, pwdOrToken: user token.
List<ChatDeviceInfo> deviceInfos =
        await ChatClient.getInstance.fetchLoggedInDevices(
    userId: 'userId',
    pwdOrToken: 'token',
    isPwd: false,
);
// userId: user ID, pwdOrToken: user token.
await ChatClient.getInstance.kickDevice(
    userId: 'userId',
    pwdOrToken: 'token',
    resource: deviceInfos[selectedIndex].resource!,
    isPwd: false,
);
```

### Force the specified account to log off from all devices

Call `kickAllDevices` to kick the specified account off from all logged-in devices by passing in the user ID and user token.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">You can also use this interface without logging in.</Admonition>

```dart
// userId: user ID, pwdOrToken: user token.
await ChatClient.getInstance.kickAllDevices(
    userId: 'userId',
    pwdOrToken: 'pwdOrToken',
    isPwd: false,
);
```

### Get operations on other devices

Let's say that account A logs in on devices A and B at the same time and performs operations on device A. Device B will receive notifications corresponding to these operations.

You need to implement the `ChatMultiDeviceEventHandler` class to listen to operations on other devices, and then call the `addMultiDeviceEventHandler` method to add multi-device listening.

```dart
//Implement `ChatMultiDeviceEventHandler` to monitor operations on other devices.
private class ChatMultiDeviceListener implements MultiDeviceListener {
final eventHandler = ChatMultiDeviceEventHandler(
    onContactEvent: (event, userId, ext) {
        switch (event) {
            //The current user deletes friends on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.CONTACT_REMOVE:
            break;
            //The current user accepts friend requests on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.CONTACT_ACCEPT:
            break;
            //The current user rejects friend requests on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.CONTACT_DECLINE:
            break;
            //The current user adds a user to the blocklist on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.CONTACT_BAN:
            break;
            //The current user removes a user from the blocklist on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.CONTACT_ALLOW:
            break;
            default:
        }
    },
    onGroupEvent: (event, groupId, userIds) {
        switch (event) {
            //The current user created a group on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_CREATE:
            break;
            //The current user destroyed the group on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_DESTROY:
            break;
            //The current user joined the group on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_JOIN:
            break;
            //The current user left the group on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_LEAVE:
            break;
            //The current user initiated a group application on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_APPLY:
            break;
            //The current user agreed to the group application on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_APPLY_ACCEPT:
            break;
            //The current user rejected the group application on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_APPLY_DECLINE:
            break;
            //The current user invited group members on another device.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_INVITE:
            break;
            //The current user has accepted the invitation to join the group on other devices.
            case ChatMultiDevicesEvent.GROUP_INVITE_ACCEPT:
