Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. In `MainActivity` update the values for `myAppId`, and `token` with values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Fill in the same `channelName` name you used to generate the token.

1. Enable developer options on your Android test device. Turn on USB debugging, connect the Android device to your development machine through a USB cable, and check that your device appears in the Android device options.

1. In Android Studio, click ![](/images/video-sdk/icon_android_gradle_sync.png) **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to resolve project dependencies and update the configuration.

1. After synchronization is successful, click ![](/images/video-sdk/icon_android_run.png) **Run app**. Android Studio starts compilation. After a few moments, the app is installed on your Android device.

5. On a second Android device, repeat the previous steps to install and launch the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. Alternatively, use the [Web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) to join the same channel and test the following use-cases:

    * If users on both devices join the channel as hosts, they can see and hear each other.
    * If one user joins as host and the other as audience, the host can see themselves in the local video window; the audience can see the host in the remote video window and hear the host.
