Stream Channels are based on the room model. In a stream channel, users join a topic in order to send message to all users subscribed to that topic.  <Vg k="MESS"/> enables each user to join up to one hundred channels at the same time. Each channel can have unlimited topics and up to 128 simultaneous users. Topics have a higher message transmission rate, greater message concurrency capability, and enable synchronous transmission of audio and video data. You use topics for Metaverse, AR/VR, interactive games, real-time collaboration, and parallel manipulation <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

For information about message channels where users communicate using a pub-sub model, see the [Message channel quickstart](/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk).
