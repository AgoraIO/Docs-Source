Take the following steps to set up your Linux development environment:

1. Install the `build-essential` package.

    If you don't have development tools installed on your machine, execute the following command in the terminal to install the `build-essential` package which contains `libc`, `gcc`, `g++`, and other development tools.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
    ```
2. Ensure `cmake` is installed.

    The sample project uses `cmake` to control the software compilation process. Execute `cmake --version` to check that the version number is greater than `3.6.0`. If `cmake` is not installed, install it using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install cmake
    ```
