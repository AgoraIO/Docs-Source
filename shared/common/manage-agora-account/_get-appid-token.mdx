### Get Started with Agora

To join a real-time engagement session powered by Agora, you need to provide an App ID and temp Token. This page shows you how to get the information.

#### Create an Agora account

[Sign up](https://sso.agora.io/en/signup/) to create an Agora account. After signup, log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

#### Create an Agora project

Once you finish the signup process, you can create an Agora project in  <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

To create an Agora project, do the following:

1.  In <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, open the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page.

1.  Click **Create New**.

1.  Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a project name and use case, and check **Secured mode: APP ID + Token (Recommended)** as the authentication mechanism.

1.  Click **Submit**. You can now see the project on the **Projects** page.

#### Get the App ID

Agora automatically assigns each project an App ID as a unique identifier.

To copy this App ID, find your project on the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page in  <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, and click the copy icon in the **App ID** column.

#### Get the App Certificate

When generating a token on your app server, you need to fill parameters such as the App ID, channel name, user ID, and App Certificate.

To get an App Certificate, do the following:

1.  On the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page, click the pencil icon for the project you want to use.

#### Generate a Customer ID and Customer Secret

The Agora RESTful API uses a Customer ID and Customer Secret for basic HTTP authorization.

To generate a set of Customer ID and Customer Secret, do the following:

1.  In <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>, open **Developer Toolkit** > **RESTful API** from the drop-down list to enter the **RESTful API** page.

1.  Click **Add a Secret**. A set of Customer ID and Customer Secret is generated.

1.  Click **Download** in the **Customer Secret** column. Read the pop-up window carefully, and save the downloaded `key_and_secret.txt` file in a secure location.

#### Generate a temporary token

To ensure communication security, best practice is to use tokens to authenticate the users who log in from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

To generate a temporary RTC token for use in your Video SDK projects:

1. On the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/project-management">Projects</Link> page, click the pencil icon next to your project.

1. On the **Security** panel, click **Generate Temp Token**, enter a channel name in the pop-up box and click **Generate**. Copy the generated RTC token for use in your Video SDK projects.

To generate a token for other Agora products:

1. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> token builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/).

1. Choose the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> product your user wants to log in to. Fill in **App ID** and **App Certificate** with the
details of your project in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

1. Customize the token for each user. The required fields are visible in the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token builder.

    <ProductWrapper product="signaling">
    In <Vg k="MESS" />, each authentication token you create is specific for a user ID in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You create
a token for each user in the channel. When you call `login` using <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, ensure that the UID is the same
as you used to create the token.

    </ProductWrapper>

1. Click **Generate Token**.

    The token appears in Token Builder.

1. Add the token to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
