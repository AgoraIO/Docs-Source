The <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> is the latest generation of the whiteboard SDK launched by Agora to help developers quickly build whiteboard applications. It simplifies the APIs of the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> and implements the core functionality with a default user interface (UI). In addition, the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" /> integrates [window-manager](https://github.com/netless-io/window-manager) and extensions from [netless-app](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app) to allow developers to easily add extensions to extend the functionality of their whiteboard applications. With the <Vg k="FAST_SDK" />, you do not need to learn the complex concepts of the interactive whiteboard; you can join a whiteboard room with a few lines of code and instantly use the rich editing tools to start real-time interactive collaboration.


## v0.3.2
v0.3.2 was released on April 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes
This release replaces the framework used to build the whiteboard UI. As of this release, you do not need to add `react` and `react-dom` dependencies when integrating the SDK. For detailed SDK integration steps, see [Add dependencies](./join_whiteboard_room_web_fastboard).

#### New features
**1. Configurations for the whiteboard user interface (UI)**

This release adds the `options` parameter to the `mount` method for configuring the whiteboard UI. You can use this parameter to set the theme, language, and each component's display state on the whiteboard UI.

In addition, for the `update` method returned by the the `mount` method, this release changes the theme and language parameters to the `props` parameter. You can use the `props` parameter to update the theme, language, and each component's display state on the whiteboard UI.

**2. Text settings**

This release adds the `setTextColor` and `setTextSize` methods in the `FastboardApp` class for setting the text color and font size. You can use these methods to implement your own text editing functions.

**3. Manage extension buttons**

This release adds the `AppsInToolbar` class, which provides the following methods to manage extension buttons on the toolbar:

- `push`: Adds an extension button at the end of the extension center.

- `insert`: Adds an extension button at the specified position.

- `delete`: Deletes a specified extension button.

- `clear`: Deletes all extension buttons.

#### Improvements
This release has the following improvements:

- Optimizes the style of the whiteboard UI.

- Automatically hides all components on the whiteboard UI when a user joins a whiteboard room in read-only mode to avoid having a user click on unresponsive components.

## v0.2.8

v0.2.8 was released on March 7, 2022. This is the first official release of the UI Kit.

#### Features

**Implementations of the core whiteboard functionality and user interface (UI)**

This release directly implements the basic functions of the interactive whiteboard with a default UI. After integrating the UI Kit and calling `createFastboard` to join the whiteboard room, you can use the following functions:

- The whiteboard toolbar, which includes all basic whiteboard editing tools, such as pencil, text editor, and shape tools. It also supports setting stroke width, font size, and stroke color.

- The whiteboard page control, which enables you to add and switch whiteboard pages.

- The view control, which you can use to zoom in and out of the current whiteboard page and adjust the view.

- Undo and redo an action.

In addition, the UI Kit provides the following APIs to enable you to implement these functions with customized UIs:

- `setAppliance`

- `setStrokeWidth`

- `setStrokeColor`

- `moveCamera`

- `moveCameraToContain`

- `undo`

- `redo`

#### Adding and using extensions

The UI Kit integrates [window-manager](https://github.com/netless-io/window-manager) and extensions from [netless-app](https://github.com/netless-io/netless-app) to enable you to quickly add and use extensions in the whiteboard application. This release provides the following extensions with UI:

- Code editor: A code editing extension developed based on Monaco Editor.

- Countdown: A timer extension developed by Agora.

- GeoGebra: A mathematical calculator extension developed based on GeoGebra.

Users can use these extensions immediately after joining the whiteboard room. This release also integrates the following extensions without UI and provides APIs for you to use them:

- Media player: An extension for playing audio and video. You can call `insertMedia` to use this extension.

- Docs viewer: An extension for displaying static documents. You can call `insertDocs` to use this extension.

- Slide: An extension for displaying dynamic document. You can call `insertDocs` to use this extension.

In addition, you can develop and add custom extensions to your whiteboard application according to your business needs.

<div class="alert note">The GeoGebra extension in the UI Kit is for demonstration purposes only. For commercial use, contact GeoGebra to apply for a license.</div>

#### Display files

The UI Kit supports inserting and displaying files in multiple formats on the whiteboard, such as images in PNG and JPG formats, audio and video in MP3 and MP4 formats, and documents in PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF formats. For detailed implementation steps, see [Display Files](./present_files).
