When users log in and out of <Vg k="SIG" />, or when the network connection state changes, the connection between the Agora <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> and Agora <Vg k="SIG" /> switches between different states. The possible connection states are as follows:

-   CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED - The user is not connected.

-   CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTING - The user is connecting.

-   CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED - The user is connected.

-   CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING - The user is reconnecting.

-   CONNECTION_STATE_ABORTED - The user is kicked out.

In the following figure, the solid lines show conditions where the SDK automatically switches states, and the dotted lines show conditions where the user needs to actively call APIs to switch states.

Whenever the connection state changes, the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> returns the latest state (the `ConnectionState` enumeration) and the cause for the state change (the `ConnectionStateReason` enumeration) through the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback. You can manage connection states through this callback.
