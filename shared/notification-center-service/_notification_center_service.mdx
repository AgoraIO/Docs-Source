A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You use webhooks to notify your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> or back-end system when certain <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> events occur. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> enables you to subscribe to events and receive notifications about them across multiple product lines.

## Understand the tech

Using <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> you subscribe to specific events for your project and tell <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> the URL of the webhooks you have configured to receive these events. <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends notifications of your events to your webhooks every time they occur. Your server authenticates the notification and returns `200 Ok` to confirm reception. You use the information in the JSON payload of each notification to give the best user experience to your users.

The following figure illustrates the workflow when <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> is enabled for the specific <Vpd k="NAME" /> events you subscribe to:

<ProductWrapper product="video-calling, voice-calling, interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
![rtc-channel](/images/shared/ncs-worflow.svg)
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="cloud-recording">
![cloud-recording](/images/notification-center-service/ncs-cloud-recording-workflow.svg)
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="media-pull">
![media-pull](/images/notification-center-service/ncs-media-pull.svg)
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product="media-push">
![media-push](/images/notification-center-service/ncs-media-push.svg)
</ProductWrapper>

1. A user commits an action that creates an event. For example, creates a channel.
1. <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends an HTTPS POST request to your webhook.
1. Your server validates the request signature, then sends a response to <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> within 10 seconds. The response body must be in JSON.

If <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> receives `200 OK` within 10 seconds of sending the initial notification, the callback is considered successful. If these conditions are not met, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> immediately resends the notification. The interval between notification attempts gradually increases. <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> stops sending notifications after three retries.

## Prerequisites

To set up and use <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, you must have:

- A [valid Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account).
- An [active Agora project](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-project).
- A computer with Internet access.
    
    If your network access is restricted by a firewall, call the [IP address query API](#ip-address-query-api) to retrieve the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> IP addresses , then configure the firewall to allow these IP addresses.

## Handle notifications for specific events

In order to handle notifications for the events you subscribe to, you need to:
- [Create your webhook](#create-your-webhook)
- [Enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />](#enable-notifications)
- [Verify <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> signatures](#add-signature-verification)
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling, voice-calling, interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- [Handle redundant notifications and abnormal user activity](#handle-redundant-notifications-and-abnormal-user-activity)
- [Implement online user status tracking](#implement-online-user-status-tracking)
 
</ProductWrapper>

### Create your webhook

Once <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> is enabled, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends notification callbacks as `HTTPS POST` requests to your webhook when events that you are subscribed to occur. The data format of the requests is JSON, the character encoding is `UTF-8`, and the signature algorithm is `HMAC/SHA1` or `HMAC/SHA256`.

For <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, a webhook is an endpoint on an `HTTP` server that handles these requests. In a production environment you write this in your web infrastructure, for development purposes best practice is to create a simple local server and use a service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to supply a public URL that you register with  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> when you enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />.

To do this, take the following steps:

1. **Set up a Java project for your server**

    Your server receives and handles notifications. The `RootHandler` handles requests sent to the root address of your server and the `NcsHandler` handles the notifications sent to `<your server address>/ncsNotify`. To set up your server, create a new Java project and add the following code to a file named `Main.java`:

    ```java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
    import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

    public class Main {
      public static int port = 80;

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start http server
        SimpleHttpServer httpServer = new SimpleHttpServer();
        httpServer.Start(port);
      }

      static class SimpleHttpServer {
        private HttpServer server;

        public void Start(int port) {
          try {
            server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(port), 0);
            System.out.println("Notifications webhook server started on port " + port);
            server.createContext("/", new Handlers.RootHandler());
            server.createContext("/ncsNotify", new Handlers.NcsHandler());
            server.setExecutor(null);
            server.start();
          } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
          }
        }

        public void Stop() {
          server.stop(0);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1.  **Add a JSON library to your project**

    The body of an HTTP request that your server receives contains event parameters in JSON format. To read these parameters download the [`json-simple-1.1.1.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/json-simple/json-simple/1.1.1/) library and add it to your JAVA project. 

1. **Handle <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> callbacks**

    To define the `RootHandler` and the `NcsHandler`, create a new file named `Handlers.java` in your Java project folder. Add the following code to this file:

    <EventHandler />

1. **Create a public URL for your server**

    In this example you use ngrok to create a public URL for your server.

    1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). If you have `Chocolatey`, use the following command:

        ```bash
        choco install ngrok
        ```
    
    1. Add an `authtoken` to ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok config add-authtoken <authToken>
        ```

        To obtain an `authToken`, [sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) with ngrok.


    1. Start a tunnel to your local server using the following command:

        ```bash
        ngrok http <local server port>
        ```

        You see a **Forwarding** URL displayed such as `https://1111-123-456-789-99.ap.ngrok.io`. This is the public URL for your local server that you use to enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />.

### IP address query API

If your server that receives notification callbacks is behind a firewall, you need to call the IP address query API to retrieve the IP addresses of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> and configure your firewall to trust all these IP addresses.

Agora occasionally adjusts the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> IP addresses. Best practice is to call this endpoint at least every 24 hours and automatically update the firewall configuration.

#### Prototype

* Method: `GET`
* Endpoint: `https://api.agora.io/v2/ncs/ip`

#### Request header

Authorization: You must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the Customer ID and Customer Secret provided by Agora, and then pass the credential to the Authorization field in the HTTP request header. 

#### Request body

This API has no body parameters.

#### Response body

When the request succeeds, the response body looks like the following:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "service": {
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                },
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Each primary IP field shows an IP address of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server. When you receive a response, you need to note the primary IP fields and add all these IP addresses to your firewall's allowed IP list.

### Considerations

* <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> does not guarantee that notification callbacks arrive at your server in the same order as events occur.
* Your server needs to be able to handle messages arriving out of order.
* To improve the reliability of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, there can be more than one notification callback for each event, and your server needs to be able to handle repeated messages.
