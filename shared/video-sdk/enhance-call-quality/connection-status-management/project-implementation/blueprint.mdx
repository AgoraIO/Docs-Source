When the connection status changes, <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends a `FOnConnectionStateChanged` callback. This section describes how to use the `FOnConnectionStateChanged` callback to monitor changes in a channel's connection state.

 1. Create the `OnConnectionStateChanged` callback function and configure the following parameters:

    |Connection state |Description |Parameter description |
    |:----------------|:-----------|:---------------------|
    |`state` |Enum |The current network connection status. |
    |`reason` |Enum |The reason why the network connection state changed. See [State description and troubleshooting](#state-description-and-troubleshooting). |

 1. Add a listener for the `OnConnectionStateChanged` callback as shown below:

 1. When the channel connection state changes and the `OnConnectionStateChanged` callback is triggered, it prints information about the state of the monitored network connection. You can read the current connection state and the reason for the state change from the log which helps you troubleshoot the network.
