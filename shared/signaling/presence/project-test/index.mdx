import RunApp from '@docs/shared/common/project-test/run-reference-app.mdx';
import SetTokenConfig from '@docs/shared/common/project-test/set-rtm-token.mdx';

For each user in your tests:

1. **Configure the project**

    <SetTokenConfig/>

1. **Run the reference app**

    <RunApp/>

1. **Test presence functionality**:

    1. Run multiple instances of the **SDK quickstart** example.
    1. Log in to <Vg k="SIG" /> from each instance using a different user ID. 
    1. Subscribe to the same channel from all instances.
        You see a list of all users in the channel.
    1. Unsubscribe a user from the channel.
        You see that the corresponding user ID disappears from the user list.
