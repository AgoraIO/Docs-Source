You use <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="CP"/> to ensure reliable connectivity for your users when they connect from an environment with a restricted network.

## Understand the tech

To accommodate your end users’ firewall settings and business needs, <Vg k="CP"/> offers the following operating modes:

-   **Automatic** (Default mode)

    By default, <Vpd k="SDK" /> first attempts a direct connection to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. If the attempt fails, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically falls back and sends media securely on TLS 443. This is best practice when you are not sure if your end users are behind a firewall. While transmitting media over TLS 443 may not provide as high quality as using UDP. a connection on TLS 443 works through most firewalls. This is the default behavior of <Vpd k="SDK" /> when cloud proxy type is set to `NONE` (default); you don't need to write any code to enable it.

-   **Force UDP**

    In the Force UDP mode of <Vg k="CP"/>, <Vpd k="SDK" /> securely sends media over UDP only. Your end users’ firewall must be configured to trust a list of [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips).
    This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and require media with the highest possible quality. This mode does not support pushing streams to the CDN or relaying streams across
    channels.

-   **Force TCP**

    In the Force TCP mode of <Vg k="CP"/>, <Vpd k="SDK" /> securely sends media over TLS 443 only. This is best practice when your end users are behind a firewall and the firewall’s security policies only allow media to flow through
    TLS 443. In some cases the firewall might trust any traffic over TLS 443. However, in many cases the firewall is configured to trust only a specific range of IP addresses sending traffic over TLS 443. In this case, your end user’s firewall must be
    configured to trust a list of [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips). Media quality might be impacted if network conditions degrade.


Agora recommends upgrading to the [latest SDK](../../sdks) version, which supports all three operating modes.

The following figure shows the <Vg k="CP"/> workflow:

The steps you need to implement <Vg k="CP"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> are:

1. Attempt to join a channel using the default Automatic mode. 

    If the attempt fails, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically falls back and sends media securely on TLS 443.

1. If communication on TLS 443 also fails, set <Vg k="CP"/> type to UDP and join a channel.

1. When the request succeeds, <Vg k="CP"/> sends back the proxy information.

1. <Vpd k="SDK" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards this data to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.

1. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends signaling and media data to <Vg k="CP"/>, which forwards it to <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

- Enabled <Vg k="CP"/>.

    -   If your estimated PCU during a month is 200 or less:

        1.  In <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>, click **Projects**.

        2.  In **Project Management**, click **Config** for the project you want to enable <Vg k="CP"/> for.

        3.  Under **Features**, find **<Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes)**, then click **Enable**.

        4.  Read the **Enable Cloud Proxy** information carefully. Check the box showing you have read the page, then click
            **Enable**.

            Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/> within 24 hours.

        5.  Check the **Status** of <Vg k="CP"/> (Force UDP and Force TCP modes). Once you see **Enabled**, Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has access to <Vg k="CP"/>.

        After activation, you can deactivate <Vg k="CP"/> at any time using <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. <Vg k="CP"/> is deactivated immediately.

    -   If your estimated Peak Concurrent Users (PCU) during a month exceeds 200, and you want to use either Force UDP or Force TCP
        mode, contact [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> Customer Support](mailto:support@agora.io) to activate <Vg k="CP"/>.        

- Configured your firewall to allow communication through the <Vg k="CP"/> [allowed IP address](../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips).
