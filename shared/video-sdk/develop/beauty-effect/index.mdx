This article introduces how to implement two advanced beauty functions: beauty and makeup.

<PlatformWrapper platform={['android','ios','macos','windows']}>

## Understand the tech

The <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides `setBeautyEffectOptions` methods for implementing basic beauty functions such as whitening and skin smoothening.

Since v4.5.0, the SDK provides the following advanced beautification features:
    - Beautification: Modify various parts of the face (i.e. pinch the face), use preset templates to achieve micro-plastic surgery effects such as thin face, big eyes, thin nose, etc., and also support fine-tuning each part of the face to achieve more refined beautification effects.
    - Makeup: Achieve makeup effects such as eye shadow, colored contact lense, eyelash, eyebrow, lip gloss, blush, etc.

<Admonition>
Currently, <Vg k="RTEE_BEAUTY" /> is free for a limited time. In the future, it may be changed to a value-added service with separate billing. Please refer to the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/billing">billing policy</Link> for details.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before implementing advanced beauty, please make sure:

    - Real-time Interactive SDK v4.5.0 or above has been integrated.
    - The basic real-time audio/video functions have been implemented in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, and the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has obtained permission to use the relevant devices. Refer to the [Quickstart](../get-started/sdk-quickstart).
    - The SDK has integrated the video enhancement dynamic library. If you remove the dynamic library, you will not be able to start the advanced beauty function normally.
    - If you need to use the beauty function, please
    contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to obtain beauty resources.
