Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. <Vg k="COMPANY" />
uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> to join a
channel. Each token is valid for a limited period and works for specific and wildcard channel names. For example, you
use a `Agora*` token to join `AgoraChannel` or `AgoraAwesome`. However, you cannot use it to join the `AppTest`
channel.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use it to connect securely to a  <Vpd k="NAME"/> channel. You use this server for development purposes. To see how to develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns
an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel or wildcard channels.

When users attempt to connect to an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:


-   The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The [App certificate](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The name of an individual channel, or a wildcard string for multiple channels

-   The user ID of the user to be authenticated (optional)

-   The privilege of the user, either as a publisher or a subscriber

-   The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must have:

-  Implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk)
-  Created a [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account verified through your github account

    If you want to integrate a token generator directly into your security infrastructure, see [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

<Prerequisites />

## Project setup

To integrate token authentication into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

1.  Open the project you created in the [Quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk).

2.  Log in to your [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.

## Implement the authentication workflow

In the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/> project you implemented, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an authentication token obtained manually from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to join a channel. In a production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1.  [Create and run a token server](#create-and-run-a-token-server)

2.  [Authenticate using the SDK](#authenticate-using-the-sdk)

### Create and run a token server

This section shows you how to deploy a token server on a cloud platform.

1.  To deploy a token server on a cloud platform like [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 
1.  Choose any cloud platform:
    1.   Render: [Click here](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service). 
    1.   Railway: [Click here](https://railway.app/new/template/NKYzQA?referralCode=waRWUT).
    1.   Heroku: [Click here](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service).

    The cloud platform will retrieve the project code and necessary files from Github, then takes you to the **Deployment** page. On this page, fill in the following information as appropriate to your selected cloud platform:

    1.  `Blueprint name`: A unique name for your deployment.

    1.  `Branch name`: Which branch of the repo or fork you want to deploy, default is main.

    1.  `APP_CERTIFICATE`: The App Certificate obtained from <Link target="_blank" to="{{global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.

    1.  `APP_ID`: The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) obtained from <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Console.

    1.  `Github account`: The GitHub account where the cloud platform should clone the token server repository.

    1.  `Repository name`: The name of the cloned repository, the default is `agora-token-service`.

    1.  `Private repository`: Select this option to hide this repoisitory.

2.  Click **Deploy**. The platform configures and builds the token server.

3.  Click the **URL**.

    You will be notified of a URL where your server has been deployed. Click it to open the token server URL in your browser.

    Don’t worry if you see `404 page not found` in your browser. Follow the next steps and test your server.

4.  Test your server

    To retrieve a token, send a request to the token server using a URL based on the [Token server GET request structure](#token-server-get-request-structure):

    ```text
    /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
    ```

    For example: `https://agora-token-server-l2yj.onrender.com/rtc/MyChannel/1/uid/1/?expiry=300`

        Your token server returns the following JSON object to your browser:

        ```json
        {"rtcToken":"ThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleToken"}
        ```
To see how to create a token generator inside your IAM system, see [Integrate a token generator](../develop/integrate-token-generation).

### Authenticate using the SDK

To integrate authentication into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:
<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token authentication workflow in your app:

1.  [Generate a token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

    Users communicate securely using channels in the same project. The *App ID* you use to generate this token must be the same one you supplied to the cloud platform.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

    { <ProjectTest /> }

Your <Vpl k="PLATFORM" /> <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> magically connects to the same channel you used in web demo. You don’t need to hardcode a token in your app; each channel is secured with a specific token, and each token is refreshed automatically. That’s pretty cool!

#### Source code for a token server

The token server RESTful web service used in this page is written in Golang using the Gin framework. Want to use the code in your authentication service? [Download](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service/releases/latest) the token server source code and binaries for various platforms from Github.

To see how to create a token generator inside your IAM system, see [Integrate a token generator](../develop/integrate-token-generation).

#### Token server GET request structure

A token server GET request has the following structure:

    ```html
    /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
    ```

-   `:channelName` is the name of the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel, or a wildcard for multiple channels that the local
user may join. For example, you use a `Agora*` token to join `AgoraChannel` or `AgoraAwesome`. However, you cannot
use it to join the `AppTest`channel.

    A channel name may contain numbers with both upper and lower case letters. The name length must be less than 64
    characters. Wildcard channels work for tokens that start with `007` and later.

-   `:role` is the user role

    Use `publisher` for publisher, `subscriber` for subscriber.

-   `:tokentype` is the type of token

    <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> supports both integer user IDs and string user accounts for token generation. To ensure smooth communication, all the users in a channel must use the same type of ID, that is, either the integer `uid`, or a string `userAccount`. Best practice is to use the `uid`.

-   `:uid` is the user ID

    User Id can be any 32-bit unsigned integer. It can be set to 0, if you do not need to authenticate the user based on the user ID.

-   `expireTime` (optional) is the number of seconds after which the token will expire

    By default, a token expires after 24 hours unless a shorter life span is explicitly specified in the token request.
