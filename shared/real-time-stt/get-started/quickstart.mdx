<Vpd k="NAME"/> subscribes to the audio content of a media stream and transcribes it into text in real time. This page shows you how to use basic RESTful API to enable <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

Note that the command-line examples are for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, send RESTful API requests through your application server.

## Understand the tech

The following diagram illustrates the complete process of implementing <Vpd k="NAME"/>:

    ![real-time-stt-flow](/images/real-time-stt/real-time-stt-flow.png)

This includes the following steps:

1. `acquire`

    Before starting the transcription, call `acquire` to obtain a transcription resource. If the request is successful, you get a resource ID in the response body.

1. `start`

    Call `start` to join the channel and start the transcription. If the request is successful, you get a task ID in the response body that marks the current transcription session.

1. `update`

    When <Vpd k="NAME"/> is enabled, the `update` command can support changing some parameters like language or whether to transcribe for a specific host or all hosts in a channel.

1. `query`

    Between the `start` and `stop` calls, you can query the service status and update configuration parameters.

1. `stop`

    Call `stop` to stop the transcription.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must:

## Project setup

To enable <Vpd k="NAME"/> before using it for the first time, take the following steps:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link> and open the **Project Management** page.
1. Find the project for which you want to enable <Vpd k="NAME"/> and click the pencil icon.
1. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Real-Time STT** and click **Enable**.
1. Click **Enable Real-Time STT** and **Apply** to confirm.

Now you can use Agora <Vpd k="NAME"/> and see the usage statistics on the **Usage** page.

## Implement <Vpd k="NAME"/>

The following diagram shows a simple API call sequence of <Vpd k="NAME"/>, including querying the status and updating the configuration before the transcription stops:

### Pass basic HTTP authentication

RESTful APIs require you to pass basic HTTP authentication by setting the `Authorization` parameter in every HTTP request header. For how to get the `Authorization` value, see [RESTful authentication](../reference/restful-authentication).

### Acquire a token and reserve a resource

Call `acquire` to request `buildToken` and reserve a resource for <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

After a successful request, you get `tokenName`, also referred to as a resource ID, in the response body. The resource ID is valid for five minutes only, so you need to start transcribing within that time. Because the `stop` request also requires the resource ID, store it until the transcription is stopped. One resource ID can be used only for one transcription session.

**Request example**

```shell
curl --location -g 'https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/builderTokens' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    // Set by developer, maximum length is 64 characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9,"-","_"). Recommended to use channel name as the instanceID.
    "instanceId": "XXXX"
}'
```

**Response example**

- Success

    ```json
    {
      "createTs": 1678505791,  // Create the time stamp of builderToken.
      "instanceId": "XXXX",    // Same as the acquire request.
      "tokenName": "nUwUbQf9Zg6tsgtLslGnDg0lk8RYaUE09pqOuSIgwfy1uJa4K6lWCzLqJNDen8tHgNjbAcOGIWpgWQEllEvR86LKWnExC9WFhPSQo0Eim0W2guETD_yO4hsHLKNpKvcTivXo5PNOYqLEANOdsLbU8pQ5fRgwcxplOVI_GT5MR6YhPT-2O4h64xTS3qpMZv1qtV8dLpcaxTKDwK5zckGk6PKjRycZ_BClZTTKlKXKkfPztQNwyKa00UJDJK5uyZqzExx-Q_PGQEB2r-u4oWriMaqmSo1M8ShsI4TX-920jE0MoB_JBb5GHQUpmHcZOJCTMO2SiKwZLzMK0F-jAaWYBbhRAu3hnQ_LjtcWvDJEDWkEJZonYjTfENjvwOsjFPvp"
    }
    ```

- Failure

    ```json
    {
     "message": string // Error reason
    }
    ```

### Start the service

Call `start` within five minutes after getting the resource ID to join the channel and start a transcription session.

After a successful request you get `taskID` in the HTTP response body. This ID is a unique identification of the current transcription session.

**Request example**

This is a simple request example to start the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service. Refer to [Encrypt captions](../develop/encrypt-captions), [Record captions](../develop/record-captions), and [Transcribe specified hosts](../develop/transcribe-individual-host) for more feature configurations.

```shell
curl --location -g 'https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks?builderToken={{tokenName}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "languages": [
        "<YourTranscribeLanguages>"    // Can configure 2 languages max, for example, "en-US" and "ru-RU". If 2 languages are configured, the service will automatically enable language detection for an additional cost.
    ],
    "maxIdleTime": 60,                 // If the channel has no host, the service will be stopped after 60s. The configurable range is 5~2592000 seconds.
    "rtcConfig": {
        "channelName": "{<YourChannelName>}",          // The RTC channel name for which transcription needs to be enabled.
        "subBotUid": "{<YourSubscribeBotUid>}",        // The unique UID in the channel for the bot to subscribe to audio. Int UID needs to be filled as a string.
        "subBotToken":"{<YourSubscribeBotRtcToken>}",  // The RTC token for subBot to join the RTC channel. Optional, based on the RTC channel security configuration.
        "pubBotUid": "{{textUID}}",                    // The unique UID in the channel for the bot to publish text. Int UID needs to be filled as a string. subBotUid and pubBotUid MUST be different.
        "pubBotToken":"{{audioUIDChannelToken}}",      // The RTC token for pubBot to join the RTC channel. Apply the admin token.
    },
}'
```

**Response example**

- Success

    ```json
    {
      "taskId": "String",
       "createTs": number,
       "status": enum(STATUS)
    }
    ```

    | Parameter Name | Type   | Description                             |
    |----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
    | `taskId`       | String | The task ID, a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) generated by the Agora server to identify the real-time transcription task that has been created. |
    | `createTs`     | Number | The Unix timestamp (seconds) when the task was created. |
    | `status`       | Enum   | Task Status:<br/><ul><li>`IDLE`: The task has not started or has ended.</li><li>`PREPARING`: The task has received a start request.</li><li>`STARTED`: The task has started.</li><li>`IN_PROGRESS`: The task is in progress.</li><li>`STOPPING`: The task is stopping..</li><li>`STOPPED`: The task has been stopped.</li><li>`RECONNECTING`: The task is being reestablished.</li></ul> |


- Failure

    ```json
    {
     "message": string // Error reason
    }
    ```

### Query service status

You can call `query` to find out the status of the transcription session multiple times during a transcription session. After a successful request, you get the status and related information in the response body.

**Request example**

```shell
curl --location -g 'https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appId}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks/{{taskId}}?builderToken={{tokenName}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Response example**

- Success

    ```json
    {
       "taskId": "String",     // The taskId
       "createTs": number,     // The created timestamp
       "status": enum(STATUS)  // The task status: IDLE, PREPARING, STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, STOPPING, STOPPED, RECONNECTING
    }
    ```

- Failure

    ```json
    {
     "message": string // Error reason
    }
    ```

### Update service

See [Update service](../develop/update-service) for details.

### Stop the service

Call `stop` to stop transcribing. After a successful request, you get the status of the transcription session in the response body.

**Request example**

```shell
curl --location -g --request DELETE 'https://api.agora.io/v1/projects/{{appID}}/rtsc/speech-to-text/tasks/{{taskId}}?builderToken={{tokenName}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Considerations

### API calls

- Call the `start` method within 5 minutes after obtaining a resource ID. In case of timeout you'll need to request a new resource ID.
- Since a transcription session is started and stopped with the same resource ID, once a session is started, it will automatically stop when the resource ID expires. The default validity time is 24 hours and up to 48 hours.
- String UIDs are supported only on a 128 host environment, with full support planned in the near future.
- `pubBotUid` and `subBotUid` are `int` type UIDs that must be different to avoid unknown issues.
