<Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>s enable real-time messaging among multiple users and are widely applied in live broadcast use cases as stream chat in Twitch. <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>s do not have a strict membership, and members do not retain any permanent relationship with each other. Once going offline, <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> members cannot receive any messages from the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> and automatically leave the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> after 2 minutes (members on the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> allow list remain in the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> even if they stay offline for 2 minutes or more). If you want to adjust the time, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

## <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> roles and privileges

<Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>s have the following roles and privileges:

- <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> members: Regular members that can send and receive <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> messages. 
- <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> admins: They are specified by the <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> owner. Apart from sending and receiving <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> messages, they have some administrative privileges. You can add up to 99 admins for each <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>.
- <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> owner: The creator of the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>. <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> owners have the highest privileges, including specifying the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> admin, disbanding the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>, modifying the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> attributes, and managing other <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> members.

## Differences between <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> and <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>

Both <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> and <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> support instant messaging among multiple users. The major difference lies in whether members have a stable relationship. <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> members tend to remain for a long time, whereas <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> members join and leave freely.

The following table shows the feature comparisons between a <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> and a <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>:

| Feature    | <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>   | <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where all members have a stable relationship. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream chat channel, this member leaves the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000 and more  |
| Message push support | Members receive push messages when they go offline. | Members do not receive push messages when they go offline. |
| Offline message storage   | This feature is supported. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat servers store messages sent to offline group members and sends to them once they go back online. A maximum number of 200 messages across <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s can be stored per end user.  | <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> does not store messages sent to offline <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> members and this feature is not supported in <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s. |
| Message history  | <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. You can call [this Client API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/client-api/messages/retrieve-messages?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages-of-the-specified-conversation) to allow the SDK to retrieve message history of a <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>. This allows end users to synchronize messages history across multiple end devices.  | <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat currently does not support SDK retrieving message history of a chatroom via client APIs. However, when a user joins a <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Chat servers send 10 most recent messages to the client side via the message receiving callback. The number of historical messages sent to the new <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> member can be increased up to 200, without additional charges.|
| Message reliability | Each member receives all the messages in the <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |
