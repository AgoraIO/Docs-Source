This section explains how to handle autoplay failures and ensure media plays properly when user interaction is required.

### Handle autoplay failure using `onAutoplayFailed`

When an audio or video track fails to play automatically, use the `onAutoplayFailed` callback to prompt users to resume playback with a button click.

Refer to the following sample code to display a button to handle autoplay failure:

```javascript
AgoraRTC.onAutoplayFailed = () => {
  const btn = document.createElement("button");
  btn.innerText = "Click me to resume the audio/video playback";
  btn.onclick = () => {
    btn.remove();
  };
  document.body.append(btn);
};
```

If multiple audio or video track objects attempt to play automatically within a short time and autoplay fails, the `onAutoplayFailed` callback is triggered only once. After the user clicks to resume playback, the callback does not fire again for subsequent tracks until user interaction resumes.

### Handle autoplay failure in iOS Safari/WebView

For desktop browsers, ensuring interaction before playback resolves most autoplay restrictions. However, iOS Safari/WebView has more stringent autoplay policies:

- iOS Safari allows audio playback only when directly triggered by user interaction.
- Autoplay restrictions are not removed after the user interacts.

To support iOS Safari/WebView, adapt your user interaction flow to meet these stricter requirements.

For example, display an icon to indicate that the remote user is muted. This guides the user to click the icon to play the remote user's audio. Refer to the following sample code:

HTML:
```html
<div id="user1-audio">Muted</div>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("user1-audio").onclick = (e) => {
  if (user1.audioTrack.isPlaying) {
    user1.audioTrack.stop();
    e.target.innerHTML = "Muted";
  } else {
    user1.audioTrack.play();
    e.target.innerHTML = "Playing";
  }
};
```

This approach ensures that the playback is user-triggered and compliant with iOS Safari's strict autoplay policy.
