Use AI coding assistants to build with Agora faster. With access to Agora's full documentation, your AI assistant can generate working code examples, suggest API implementations, and answer platform-specific questions in real-time.

## Agora MCP server

Agora provides a free [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)  (MCP) server with tools for AI coding assistants to browse and search the docs site. 

The Agora MCP server is available at:

```text
https://mcp.agora.io
```

### Installation

Refer to the installation instructions for your coding assistant.

#### Cursor

</a>

or add it manually with the following JSON:


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agora-docs": {
      "url": "https://mcp.agora.io"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude 

##### Claude Code

Run the following command in your terminal to install the MCP server in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code):

```shell
claude mcp add --transport http agora-docs https://mcp.agora.io
```

##### Claude Desktop

In **Settings**, select **Connectors** and then choose **Add custom connector**. Enter the following values and click **Add**:

- **Name**: `agora-docs`
- **Remote MCP server URL**: `https://mcp.agora.io`

#### Codex

Run the following command in your terminal to install the server in [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/):

```shell
codex mcp add --url https://mcp.agora.io agora-docs
```

#### Gemini CLI

Run the following command in your terminal to install the server in [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli):

```
gemini mcp add --transport http agora-docs https://mcp.agora.io
```

#### Manual installation

Add the server URL `https://mcp.agora.io` to your MCP client of choice. If prompted, set the transport to `http` or "Streamable HTTP".

### Getting started

Once installed, your coding assistant has access to Agora's documentation through the MCP server. The assistant will intelligently use this resource when relevant to your questions. For more targeted results, mention Agora along with your target product and platform, such as 'iOS', 'Web', 'Conversational AI', 'Video Calling' in your prompts.

### System Prompt 

This MCP works with all LLMs that support MCP, but performs best when the assistant understands facet-based exploration. Add the following prompt to your LLMs custom instructions:

<details>
<summary>System prompt for LLMs</summary>

# Agora MCP Markdown - System Prompt

You have access to Agora's documentation search via three tools:
- `algolia_search_index_docs_platform_aware_markdown` - Full-text search with facets
- `algolia_search_for_facet_values` - Browse products/platforms
- `algolia_recommendations` - Find related documentation

## Key Behaviors

**1. Use facets for discovery**
- When users ask about "what's available", explore facets first
- Example: User asks "what video products exist?" 
  → Use `algolia_search_for_facet_values(facetName: "product", facetQuery: "video")`
  → Shows video-calling is the main product

**2. Platform-aware searching**
- Include target platform in search queries (iOS, Android, Web, etc.)
- Results are intelligently ranked by platform relevance

**3. Interpret facet results for refinement**
- Search results include facet breakdowns by product and platform
- Use these to suggest filtering: "15 results are for video-calling, 8 for voice-calling"

**4. Maintain session continuity**
- Use same sessionId (UUID) across related searches in a conversation
- Improves ranking for follow-up queries

## Available Products & Platforms

**Key Products:** conversational-ai, video-calling, broadcast-streaming, interactive-live-streaming, agora-chat, voice-calling, signaling, extensions-marketplace, interactive-whiteboard

**Key Platforms:** android, web, ios, windows, macos, unity, flutter, react-native, electron, unreal

## Workflow Example

User: "I'm building an iOS app with Video Calling. Where do I start?"

1. Search: "iOS video calling quickstart"
2. Results show facets indicating video-calling is the best match
3. Suggest: "Most results are for Video Calling, here's the quickstart"
4. Follow-up searches: Keep same sessionId for context
```
</details>

#### What This Enables

- Intelligent facet exploration before deep searches
- Platform-aware result refinement suggestions
- Cross-search session continuity for better context

Without the prompt, searches still work but won't leverage faceted browsing patterns.

## AGENTS.md

To get the most out of the MCP server, Agora recommends that you include an [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) or similar file in your repository, with instructions specific to the Agora Docs MCP Server. This file ensures that your agent always consults Agora docs to produce reliable, working code.

Add the following instructions to your own `AGENTS.md` file:

```markdown
## Agora Documentation

Agora documentation is updated frequently. You should always refer to the latest documentation when working with Agora products. Agora offers an MCP server that you can use to browse and search its documentation. If the developer has not yet installed this server, you should recommend that they install it at https://mcp.agora.io. 
```

## Markdown docs

Each page on the Agora docs site is available in Markdown format, optimized for pasting into AI assistants when you can't use MCP.

To access the Markdown version, modify the HTML page URL as follows:

1. Change `docs.agora.io` to `docs-md.agora.io`
1. Replace any platform query parameter such as `?platform=web` with underscore suffixes like `_web.md`
1. Add `.md` extension to the end of the path. For example:

    - **HTML**: `https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk?platform=web`   
    - **Markdown**:`https://docs-md.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk_web.md`

You can also use the Markdown dropdown on the HTML page to copy, download or view the `.md` file. Choose **Open in ChatGPT** or **Open in Claude** to directly start a chat with the page context.

## LLMs.txt

A Markdown-based index of the docs site is available at [https://docs.agora.io/llms.txt](https://docs.agora.io/llms.txt). This file includes links to all product overview pages along with brief page descriptions. It also provides instruction on how to access LLM-friendly markdown versions of all documentation pages.

For more about how to use LLMs.txt files, see [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/).
