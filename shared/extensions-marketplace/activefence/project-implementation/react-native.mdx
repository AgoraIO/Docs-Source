2. **Initialize `ContentInspectConfig`**

   Set up the inspect config inside `ContentInspectModule`. If you use a string UID to join the channel and want to receive it in the webhook callback, pass the string UID to `YourExtraInfo` inside `ContentInspectConfig`.

   For example, the following config monitors the images in a video feed, taking one frame every 5 seconds:

    ```jsx
    const contentInspectModule: ContentInspectModule = {
        type: ContentInspectType.ContentInspectModeration,
        interval: 5,
    };
    const contentInspectConfig: ContentInspectConfig = {
        modules: [contentInspectModule],
        moduleCount: 1,
        extraInfo: 'YourExtraInfo',
    };
    ```

1. **Apply `ContentInspectConfig`  to your <Vg k="ENGINE"/> instance**.

    Enable content inspect after joining a channel and after the local video is published and played.  If you need support taking screenshots for multiple video streams and uploading them, use the `enableContentInspectEx` method.

    ```jsx
    const returnVal = agoraEngine?.enableContentInspect(
        true,
        contentInspectConfig
    );
    ```

1. **Catch banning events**

    To know when your local user is banned from the scene, use the `connectionStateChangedTo` delegate method:

    ```jsx
    agoraEngine?.addListener(
    'onConnectionStateChanged',
    (connection, state, reason) => {
        if (
            state === ConnectionStateType.ConnectionStateFailed &&
            reason === ConnectionChangedReasonType.ConnectionChangedBannedByServer
        ) {
            console.log('Stream banned by the server');
        }
    }
    );
    ```

    This only happen if you have applied the `Kicking Server` steps above, or created your own kicking server that communicates with ActiveFence.
