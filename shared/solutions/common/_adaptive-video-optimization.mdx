A high-definition and smooth video experience is crucial for attracting and retaining viewers. Agora's adaptive HD video strategy is key to providing exceptional live streaming experiences. Agora automatically adjusts video profile settings, including resolution, frame rate, and bitrate, based on device performance and network quality, ensuring high-definition and fluid video effects. This strategy offers significant benefits across various scenarios:

- **Corporate Meetings**: Ensures clear and smooth video, improving communication reliability and collaboration.

- **Online Education**: Delivers high-quality teaching content and reduces network latency for better real-time interaction between teachers and students.

- **Entertainment Live Streams**: Provides high-definition and smooth video to attract viewers and increase broadcasters' influence and appeal.

## Implementation

To implement the adaptive HD video strategy in your project, refer to the following steps:

1. Set the initial video parameters
    
    Before employing the adaptive HD video strategy, set the initial video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. These parameters serve as the starting point for the strategy adjustments based on device and network conditions. Refer to the [Configure video encoding](/video-calling/enhance-call-quality/configure-video-encoding) page for details.

    When switching from a single host scenario to PK battle scenario, call `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` again to set the expected video profile.

2. Enable the adaptive HD video strategy

    Call the `setParameters` method, and set `parameters` to: 
    
    ```
    "che.video.auto_adjust_resolution" : { "auto_adjust_resolution_flag": 1 }
    ```

    Once enabled, the strategy automatically adjusts the video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate, based on device performance and network quality.

3. Monitor and adjust (Optional)

    Although the adaptive HD video strategy automatically adjusts video parameters, you may still manually optimize the video effect through monitoring and adjustment. You can adjust the initial video parameters based on information obtained from monitoring of video quality and network conditions through Agora API callbacks.

    For example, if some viewers report video stuttering, further downgrade the video resolution. 
    
Best practice is to enable the video dual-stream mode for the host and set the video resolution and other attributes of the video stream to provide a lower resolution, frame rate, and bit rate video stream for viewers with poor network conditions. Additionally, you can integrate [Cloud Trancoder](https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/live-streaming-premium-legacy/cloud_transcoder) to enable video multi-bitrates.
