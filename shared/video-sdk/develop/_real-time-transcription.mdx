<Vg k="RTT" /> takes the audio content of a host's media stream and transcribes it into written words in real time.
This page explains how to start and stop speech recognition in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, then download and present the transcript.

## Understand the tech

To start transcription in real time, you send an `HTTP` request to the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />  through your business server. <Vg k="RTT" /> provides the following modes:

* Transcribe speech in real time, then stream this data to the channel.
* Transcribe speech in real time, store the text in the `WebVTT` format, and upload the file to third-party cloud storage.

In order to use the RESTful API to transcribe speech, take the following steps:

1. Call `acquire`: Request a `builderToken` for transcription. Each `builderToken` has a validity of five minutes for starting a <Vg k="RTT" /> task. 
1. Call `start`: Begin the transcription task. Once you start a task using a `builderToken`, the token does not expire and remains valid for the entire session. The same token must be used to query and stop the task.
1. Call `query`: Check the task status.
1. Call `stop`: Stop the transcription task.

The following figure shows the workflow to start, query, and stop a <Vg k="RTT" /> task:

## Prerequisites

In order to set up <Vg k="RTT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you must have:

* Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>
* Enabled <Vg k="RTT" /> for your project. Contact sales@agora.io
* Activated a [supported cloud storage service](#supported-third-party-cloud-storage-services) to record and store <Vg k="RTT" /> videos and texts
* To run the post-processing script:
  * Python 3.0
  * [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and `ffplay`

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to play media files in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the project you created in <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.

## Implement a business server

A a business server (API Server) acts as a bridge between your client and the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="RTT" /> API Server. Implementing a business server for managing your <Vg k="RTT" /> tasks provides the following benefits:

* Improved security as your `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, `builderToken`, and `taskId`, are not exposed to the client.
* Token processing is securely handled on the API Server.
* Avoid splicing complex request body strings on the client side to reduce the probability of errors.
* Implement additional functionality on the API Server, such as billing for the use of <Vg k="RTT" />, and checking the privileges, and payment status of the user.
* If the REST API is updated, you do not need to update the client.

To import the API collection for testing and to obtain sample code for your business server, see the [Postman Collection
](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6319646/SVSLr9AM#69bd200a-7543-4104-8ccc-415741abbeb7). 

## Use Google Protobuffer Generator to parse text data

Protocol buffers serve as an extensible and language-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data. Protobuffer provides you automatically generated source code, based on a specified structure to read and write data in multiple languages. For more information about Google protocol buffers, see [protobuf.dev](https://protobuf.dev/).
<Vg k="COMPANY"/> provide a protobuffer template file `Audio2TextProtoBuffer.proto` for parsing <Vg k="RTT" /> data:

```
syntax = "proto3";

package agora.audio2text;
option java_package = "io.agora.rtc.audio2text";
option java_outer_classname = "Audio2TextProtobuffer";

message Text {
  int32 vendor = 1;
  int32 version = 2;
  int32 seqnum = 3;
  int32 uid = 4;
  int32 flag = 5;
  int64 time = 6;
  int32 lang = 7;
  int32 starttime = 8;
  int32 offtime = 9;
  repeated Word words = 10;
}
message Word {
  string text = 1;
  int32 start_ms = 2;
  int32 duration_ms = 3;
  bool is_final = 4;
  double confidence = 5;
}
```

Edit the following properties to match your project:
*	`package` : The source code package namespace.
*	`option` : The language for which you want to generate the class. For example, Java or Javascript.

You generate a protobuffer class using shell script. 

* Java

  ```bash
  protoc --java_out=$(pwd) -I$(pwd) *.proto
  ```

* Javascript

  ```bash
  protoc --js_out=library=myproto_libs,binary:. messages.proto base.proto
  ```

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides iOS, Android, Web, and Unity (C#) platforms to parse Protobuf and display sample codes for text content.

## Synchronize transcription files with the cloud recording

The `m3u8+vtt` file generated by <Vg k="RTT" />, and the `m3u8+ts` file generated by [Cloud Recording](../../..
/cloud-recording/overview/product-overview.mdx) are two independent files. The time stamp references in these media
files are different, and not synchronized. The cloud recording time stamp starts at 0, the `m3u8+vtt` uses the system
time stamp. If either process starts abnormally, it the media files generated by the two
services to be out of sync during playback.

Post-processing ensures synchronization of subtitles and recorded audio. It enables you to associate the `m3u8+ts` file generated by cloud recording with the `m3u8+vtt` file generated by <Vg k="RTT" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides a post-processing script that enables you to synchronize the two files.

#### Run the post-processing script

To synchronize files generated by <Vg k="RTT" />, take the following steps:

1. Unzip the [post-processing script](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Docs-Source/files/10931258/add_webvtt.zip) to a local folder.

1. Run the script on your <Vg k="RTT" /> files:

    ```shell
     python3 insert_subtitle.py --av audio_dir/audio_ts.m3u8 --subtitle subtitle_dir/subtitle.m3u8 --output output_dir/ --overwrite
     ```

     If `ffmpeg/ffprob` are not in your `PATH`, use`â€“ffmpeg_path` to specify the path.

1. Play the synchronized files:

    1. Start the HTTP server by running the following command:

       ```shell
       python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 -doutput_dir
       ```

    1. In your browser, enter the following URL:

       ```
       http://127.0.0.1:8000/player_demo.html
       ```
