## Version 4.2.30

v4.2.30 was released on February 6, 2024.

### New features

- Multipath network transmission

    This release adds the multipath network transmission feature, which allows simultaneous transmission of audio and video streams over multiple network paths. For example, when you insert two IoT SIM cards in the device, the SDK can transmit audio and video streams through the network of both SIM cards, thereby improving the stability and reliability of audio and video transmission. Contact support@agora.io to enable and use this feature.

- Hardware encoding acceleration

    This release supports utilizing NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration for video encoding, which reduces the power consumption of CPU and improves hardware encoding efficiency and performance. Contact support@agora.io to enable and use this feature.

### Improvements

- Audio sending timestamp

    To set the timestamp at which you send the audio data, this release adds the `presentation_ms` parameter in the `sendAudioPcmData` method. In scenarios such as video conferences and remote collaboration, this parameter allows you to achieve audio and video synchronization.

### Bug fixes

This release fixed the following issues:

- App memory growth caused by receiving H.264 video raw data.
- Garbled data stream when using both string-type user IDs and data stream functions simultaneously.
