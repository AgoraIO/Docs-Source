1. **Set up a Flutter environment for a <Vpd k="NAME"/> project**

    In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Flutter checks your development device and helps you [set up](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor) your local development environment. Make sure that your system passes all the checks.

1. **Create a new Flutter <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    In the IDE of your choice, create a [Flutter Application project](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/android-studio#creating-a-new-project).

    You can also create a new project from the terminal using the command:

    ```bash
    flutter create <--insert project name-->
    ```

1. **Add <Vpd k="SDK" /> to your project**

    Add the following lines to `pubspec.yaml` under dependencies. 

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
    ...
      # For x.y.z, fill in a specific SDK version number. For example, 6.0.0
      agora_rtc_ng: ^x.y.z
      permission_handler: ^9.2.0
    ...
    ``` 

    You can get the latest <Vpl k="NAME" /> <Vpd k="SDK" /> version number from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/agora_rtc_ng).

1. **Use the Flutter framework to download dependencies to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />**

    Open a terminal window and execute the following command in the project folder:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
