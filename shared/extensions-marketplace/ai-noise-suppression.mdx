With an AI-powered noise reduction algorithm, the AI Noise Suppression extension is used together with the Agora Web SDK (v4.15.0 or later) to suppress hundreds of types of noise and reduce distortion for human voices when multiple people speak simultaneously. In scenarios such as online meetings, online chat rooms, video consultations with doctors, and online gaming, the AI Noise Suppression extension makes virtual communication as smooth as face-to-face communication.

In scenarios such as online meetings, online chat rooms, video consultations with doctors, and online gaming, the <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension makes virtual communication as smooth as face-to-face communication.

- **Noise types suppressed <a name="type"></a>**

    The <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension suppresses the following types of noise:

    - Television noise
    - Kitchen noise
    - Street noise, such as birds chirping, traffic, and subway noise.
    - Machine noise, such as noise coming from fans, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, and copiers.
    - Office noise, such as keyboard clicks and mouse clicks.
    - Household noise, such as noise coming from doors, creaking chairs, crying babies, and house renovations.
    - Constant knocking
    - Beeps and clapping sounds.
    - Music

- **Noise reduction strategies**

    The <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension supports the following noise reduction strategies:
    - **Default strategy**: Reduces noise to a comfortable level without distorting the human voice.
    - **Custom strategy**: If you need a more enhanced or custom noise reduction strategy for your business scenario, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

### Considerations

Currently, the AI Noise Suppression extension has the following limitations:
- If the sample rate of the input signal is not 16 KHz, the extension downsamples the signal to 16 KHz, removes noise, and resamples the output signal to the original sample rate.  This means the audio data above 8 KHz is removed in the output signal.
- In some unknown scenarios, the extension could cause audio quality to decrease by a certain degree.
- When multiple people speak at the same time, the audio quality of lowest human voices could be decreased by a certain degree.
- If only some of the audio tracks on the current web page enable the extension, the audio tracks that do not enable the extension could be affected because the extension turns on AEC and AGC and turns off NS in the browser.
- While the extension supports Safari later than 14.1, Agora does not recommend using the extension on Safari because of Safari's performance issues.
- Currently, the extension does not support browsers on mobile devices.

## Understand the tech

A typical transmission pipeline in the Agora Web SDK consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, preprocessing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and playback.  In the preprocessing stage, <Vg k="RTEE"/> can modify the audio and video data in the pipeline to implement features such as virtual background and noise cancellation.

## Prerequisites

To use the <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> extension, you must meet the following requirements:

- Implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>.
- [Noise type](#type) matches your business scenario.  For example, if you want the microphone to collect background music, the extension is not applicable because it categorizes such background music as noise.
<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- You have the latest version of Desktop Chrome (recommended), Edge, or Firefox.
</PlatformWrapper>
<PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
- Minimum device requirements
    - iOS iPhone 6S
    - iPadOS
    - iPad Pro (2nd generation)
    - iPad mini (5th generation)
    - iPad Air (3rd generation)
    - macOS MacBook Pro 2015
- Ensure that the dynamical extension library `AgoraAiNoiseSuppressionExtension.xcframework` is integrated into your project.

When <Vg k="RTEE_NS" /> is enabled, if <Vg k="VSDK" /> detects that the device performance is not sufficient, it:

- Disables <Vg k="RTEE_NS" />
- Enables traditional noise reduction
- Throws the -1054(WARN_APM_AINS_CLOSED) error code.
