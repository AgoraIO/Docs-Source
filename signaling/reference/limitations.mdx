A brief overview of the limitations of the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, including API call limit, string size, encoding, and more.

## Channel message limit

Agora has the following recommendations on the maximum number of channel messages per second for a single channel:

| Concurrent online users in a single channel | Number of channel messages per second |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| &lt; 1,000                                  | &lt; 200                      |
| &ge; 1,000 and &lt; 10,000                  | &lt; 100                      |
| &ge; 10,000                                 | &lt; 30                       |


If the number of messages per second exceeds the recommended values, latency can increase significantly and may also cause the following issues:
 - The user cannot send or receive messages.
 - The user always stays in the `RECONNECTING` state or keeps switching between the `CONNECTED` state and the `RECONNECTING` state. For other users, the current user may appear offline.

## Channel member limit

Agora provides customized service to increase the number of messages per second without affecting latency or stability. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a> for more information.
