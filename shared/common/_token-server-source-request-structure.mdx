#### Source code for a token server

The token server RESTful web service used in this page is written in Golang using the Gin framework. Want to use the code in your authentication service? [Download](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service/releases/tag/v1.1.1) the token server source code and binaries for various platforms from Github.

To see how to create a token generator inside your IAM system, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow).

#### Token server GET request structure

A token server GET request has the following structure:

    ``` html
    /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
    ```

-   `:channelName` is the name of the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Channel you wish to join

    A channel name may contain numbers with both upper and lower case letters. The name length must be less than 64 characters.

-   `:role` is the user role

    Use `publisher` for publisher, `subscriber` for subscriber.

-   `:tokentype` is the type of token

    <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> supports both integer user IDs and string user accounts for token generation. To ensure smooth communication, all the users in a channel must use the same type of ID, that is, either the integer `uid`, or a string `userAccount`. Best practice is to use the `uid`.

-   `:uid` is the user ID

    User Id can be any 32-bit unsigned integer. It can be set to 0, if you do not need to authenticate the user based on the user ID.

-   `expireTime` (optional) is the number of seconds after which the token will expire

    By default, a token expires after 24 hours unless a shorter life span is explicitly specified in the token request.
