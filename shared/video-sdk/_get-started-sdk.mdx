Real-time video immerses people in the sights and sounds of human connections, keeping them engaged in your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> longer.

<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> enables one-to-one or small-group video chat connections with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
<Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> enables you to host large-scale live audio and video streaming events with real-time interactivity. <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s <Vpd k="SDK" />  makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
</ProductWrapper>

Thanks to <Vg k="COMPANY"/>’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network (SD-RTN™), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This page shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vpd k="SDK" />.

## Understand the tech

This section explains how you can integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you need to integrate this feature into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

In an <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> event, hosts stream a video feed to an audience. For example, when a CEO is giving a speech to the company employees, the CEO does not need to see all members of the audience. To represent this in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, when you join as a host, the local feed is started and  you see your own video feed. When you join as a member of the audience, you see the host's video feed.
</ProductWrapper>


To start a session, implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
- *Set the channel profile and role*: For hosts, set the channel profile to `LIVE_BROADCASTING` and their role to `BROADCASTER`. For audience members, set the role to `AUDIENCE`.
</ProductWrapper>
- *Retrieve a token*: A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. In a test or production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves tokens from a server in your security infrastructure.
- *Join a channel*: Call methods to create and join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.
<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
- *Host publishes local video and audio to the channel*: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. Each host can publish their local video to the channel.
- *Audience subscribes to video and audio published by the hosts to the channel*: Audience members view content published by hosts to the channel.
</ProductWrapper>
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
- *Send and receive video and audio in the channel*: All users send and receive video and audio streams from all users in the channel.
</ProductWrapper>

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:

<Prerequites />


## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

You are ready to add <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.


## Implement a client for <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />

When a user opens the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" />. When the user taps a button, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins or leaves a channel. When another user joins the same channel, their video and audio is rendered in the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. This simple workflow enables you to concentrate on implementing <Vg k="COMPANY"/> features and not UX bells and whistles.

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" />  to implement <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, step-by-step.

<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> recommends you run this project on a physical mobile device, as some simulators may not support the full features of this project. To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
<ProjectTest />

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

- [Downloads](../reference/downloads) shows you how to install <Vpd k="SDK" /> manually.

- To ensure communication security in a test or production environment, use a token server to generate token is recommended to ensure communication security, see [Implement the authentication workflow](../develop/authentication-workflow).
