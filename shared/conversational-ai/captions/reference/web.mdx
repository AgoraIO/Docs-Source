#### `MessageEngine`

Caption processing engine.

<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`class MessageEngine (
    rtcEngine: rtcEngine,
    renderMode?: EMessageEngineMode,
    callback?: (messageList: IMessageListItem[]) => void
)`}
</CodeBlock>

- `rtcEngine`: Agora RTC engine instance.
- `renderMode`: Caption rendering mode, See [`EMessageEngineMode`](#emessageenginemode) for details. Default is `EMessageEngineMode.AUTO`.
- `callback`: Callback function for receiving caption content updates. 
    - `IMessageListItem[]` is a list of messages. See [`IMessageListItem`](#imessagelistitem) for details.

#### `EMessageEngineMode`

<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`enum EMessageEngineMode {
    TEXT = 'text',
    WORD = 'word',
    AUTO = 'auto',
}`}
</CodeBlock>

- `TEXT`: Sentence-by-sentence rendering mode. The caption content received by the callback is fully rendered on the UI.
- `WORD`: Word-by-word rendering mode. The caption content received by the callback is rendered word by word on the UI.
- `AUTO`:  Automatic mode. The rendering mode is automatically selected according to the mode supported by the TTS provider.

<Admonition type="caution"> 
Using the word-by-word rendering mode (`WORD`) requires that your chosen TTS vendor supports word-by-word output, otherwise, it will automatically fall back to sentence-by-sentence rendering mode (`TEXT`). 
</Admonition>

#### `IMessageListItem`

<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`interface IMessageListItem {
    uid: number
    turn_id: number
    text: string
    status: EMessageStatus
}`}
</CodeBlock>

- `uid`: The user ID associated with this caption message. In the current version, `0` represents the user, non-zero represents the agent ID.

- `turn_id`: The identifier of the conversation turn. One conversation turn between the user and the agent corresponds to one `turn_id`, and follows the following rules:
    - `turn_id = 0`, This is the welcome message of the agent, and there is no caption for the user.
    - `turn_id ≥ 1`, The captions for the user or agent in that round. Use the `uid` to display the user's captions before the agent's captions, and then repeat the process for round +1.

    <Admonition type="caution">
    There is no guarantee that callbacks will be in strictly increasing `turn_id` order. If you encounter out-of-order situations, implement the sorting logic yourself.
    </Admonition>

- `text`: Caption text content.
- `status`: The current status of the captions. See [`EMessageStatus`](#emessagestatus) for details.

#### `EMessageStatus`

<CodeBlock language="js" showLineNumbers>
{`enum EMessageStatus {
    IN_PROGRESS = 0,
    END = 1,
    INTERRUPTED = 2,
}`}
</CodeBlock>

- `IN_PROGRESS`: The captions are still being generated; the user or agent has not finished speaking.
- `END`: The caption generation is complete; the user or agent has finished speaking.
- `INTERRUPTED`: The captions were interrupted before completion; the user actively stopped the agent’s response.
