  Begin cloud recording
---

After getting a resource ID, call the `start` method to begin cloud recording. The Cloud Recording service does the following after you call `start`:

1. [Subscribes](../glossary#subscribe) to the audio and video streams in the channel according to `recordingConfig`.
2. Processes the subscribed media streams, such as generating recorded files in the specified file format, taking video screenshots, or uploading recorded files to an extension service.
3. Uploads the recorded files or screenshots to your third-party cloud storage according to `storageConfig`.

The HTTP method and endpoint of `start`:

- Method: POST
- Endpoint: /v1/apps/\<appid\>/cloud_recording/resourceid/\<resourceid\>/mode/\<mode\>/start

### Application configuration

`appsCollection` is a JSON Object for configuring how the application services are combined and applied. It contains the following fields:

- `combinationPolicy`: (Optional) JSON Object. The combination method of various Cloud Recording applications.
  - `default`: (Default) String.  Use this method for all application services except for Postpone Audio Mixing.
  - `postpone_transcoding`: Use this method if you use [Postpone Audio Mixing](../../develop/individual-nontranscoding#implement-an-postpone-audio-mixing) and Postpone Transcoding. 
     
<a name="recordingConfig"></a>
### Recording configuration

`recordingConfig` is a JSON object for configuring how the Cloud Recording service subscribes to the media streams in the channel. `recordingConfig` has the following fields:

- `channelType`: Number. The channel profile. Agora Cloud Recording must use the same channel profile as the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />. Otherwise, issues may occur.
  - `0`: (Default) Communication profile.
  - `1`: Live broadcast profile.
- `streamTypes`: (Optional) Number. The type of the media stream to subscribe to:
  - `0`: Subscribes to audio streams only.
  - `1`: Subscribes to video streams only.
  - `2`: (Default) Subscribes to both audio and video streams.
- `streamMode`: (Optional) String. The output mode of the media stream in individual recording mode.
- `default`: Default mode. The Cloud Recording service transcodes the audio stream during recording and generates a M3U8 audio index file and a M3U8 video index file.
- `standard`: Standard mode. Agora recommends that you use this mode. The Cloud Recording service transcodes the audio stream during recording and generates a M3U8 audio index file, a M3U8 video index file and a combined M3U8 audio and video index file. If VP8 encoding is used on the web side, a combined MPD audio and video index file are generated.
  When using the standard mode to generate MPD files, the player compatibility is as follows:
  - macOS: Movist/Chrome (47.0.2526.111+)
  - Windows: Media Player/KM Player/VLC Player/Chrome (49.0.2623+)
  - Linux: FFplay
- `original`: Original encoding mode, which takes effect only when `streamTypes` is `0`. The Cloud Recording service does not transcode the audio stream during recording and generates a M3U8 audio index file.
  The following table compares various aspects of the three modes of `streamMode`:
  | streamMode | Description                                                  | Index file generated                                         | Slice file generated                                         | Video encoded       | Audio encoded       | Features supported                                           |

  | `standard` | Standard mode.                                               | One M3U8 audio index file, one M3U8 video index file, and one combined M3U8 audio and video index file are generated per user ID. If VP8 encoding is used on the web side, a combined MPD audio and video index file is generated per user ID. | Multiple TS audio slice files and multiple TS video slice files are generated per user ID.If VP8 encoding is used on the web side, multiple WebM audio slice files and multiple WebM video slice files are generated per user ID. | Does not transcode. | Transcodes.         | Individual Recording and Capturing Screenshots.              |
  | `original` | Original encoding mode, which takes effect only when `streamTypes` is `0`. | One M3U8 audio index file is generated per user ID.          | Multiple TS audio slice files per user ID.                   | Not applicable.     | Does not transcode. | Individual Audio Non-transcoding Recording and Postpone Audio Mixing. |
- `decryptionMode`: (Optional) Number. The decryption mode, which corresponds to the encryption mode set by the Agora Native/Web SDK. When the channel is encrypted, Agora Cloud Recording uses `decryptionMode` to enable the built-in decryption function.

### Configurations for the recorded files

`recordingFileConfig` is a JSON Object for configuring recorded files. You cannot set both `recordingFileConfig` and `snapshotConfig` at the same time, otherwise an error will occur. `recordingFileConfig `includes the following fields:

`avFileType`: (Optional) JSONArray.  An array of strings. Sets the format of the recorded files.
- `"hls"`: (Default) M3U8 and TS files.
- `"mp4"`: MP4 files. This value is for composite recording (`mix`) and web page recording (`web`) only. For composite recording, when the length of the recorded file reaches approximately 2 hours, or when the size of the file exceeds approximately 2 GB, the recording service automatically creates an additional MP4 file. For web page recording, when the length of the recorded file reaches `maxVideoDuration`, the recording service automatically creates an additional MP4 file.

You must set `"mp4"` together with `"hls"` (otherwise, the recording service returns error code `2`). After the recording is over, you will get both MP4 and HLS files.

<a name="snapshotConfig"></a>
### Snapshot configuration
Agora supports only taking screenshots in a recording process or recording and taking screenshots in a recording process.
`snapshotConfig` is a JSON object for configuring how Cloud Recording takes screenshots. Pay attention to the following parameters, as incorrect settings result in errors or failure to capture screenshots.

- In the URL of your request, `mode` must be `individual`.
- If you are recording and taking screenshots in a recording process, the `recordingFileConfig` parameter is required; if you are only taking screenshots in a recording process, you cannot set `recordingFileConfig` parameter.
- `streamTypes` must be `1` or `2`.
- If you have set `subscribeAudioUid`, you must also set `subscribeVideoUids`.

`snapshotConfig` includes the following fields:

- `captureInterval`: (Optional) Integer. The time interval (in seconds) between two successive screenshots. `captureInterval` should be within the range [1, 3600]. The default value is `10`.

  - `apiData`: JSON. Configurations for ApsaraVideo for VoD.
    - `videoData`: JSON. Video configurations. See [Alibaba Cloud's documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/55407) for details about the following parameters:
      - `title`: String. The title of the video.
      - `description`: (Optional) String. The description of the video.
      - `coverUrl`: (Optional) String. The URL of the custom video thumbnail.
      - `cateId`: (Optional) String. The ID of the video category. The ID must be an integer.
      - `tags`: (Optional) String. The tags of the video.
      - `templateGroupId`: (Optional) String. The ID of the transcoding template group.
      - `userData`: (Optional) String. The custom configurations.
      - `storageLocation`: (Optional) String. The bucket.
      - `workflowId`: (Optional) String. The ID of the workflow.

Currently only composite recording is supported.

**Web page recording**
When using web page recording, `extensionServices` includes the following fields:
- `serviceName`: String. The name of the extension service. To use web page recording, set it as "`web_recorder_service`".
- `errorHandlePolicy`: (Optional) String. Error handling policy. Currently you can only set it to the default value, `"error_abort"`, which means that if an error occurs to the current extension service, other extension services also stop.
- `serviceParam`: JSON. Configurations for an extension service. To use web page recording, configure as follows:
- `url`：String. Sets the address of the web page to record.
- `videoBitrate`：(Optional) Number. Sets the bitrate of the video (Kbps). The value range is [50,8000]. The default value of `videoBitrate` varies according to the resolution of the output video:
  - If the resolution of the output video is greater than or equal to 1280 × 720, the default value of `videoBitrate` is 2000.
  - If the resolution of the output video is less than 1280 × 720, the default value of `videoBitrate` is 1500.
- `videoFps: (Optional)`Number. Sets the frame rate of the video (fps). The value range is [5,60]. The default value is 15.
- `audioProfile`：Number. Sets the sample rate, encoding mode, number of audio channels, and bitrate.
  - `0`: (Default) Sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 48 Kbps.
  - `1`: Sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, mono, and a bitrate of up to 128 Kbps.
  - `2`: Sample rate of 48 kHz, music encoding, stereo, and a bitrate of up to 192 Kbps.
- `videoWidth`：Number. Sets the width of the video (pixels). The value range is [480,1920]. The product of `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` should not exceed 2,073,600 (1920 × 1080).
- `videoHeight`：Number. Sets the height of the video (pixels). The value range is [480,1920]. The product of `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` should not exceed 2,073,600 (1920 × 1080).
- `maxRecordingHour`: Number. Sets the maximum recording length (hours). If the limit is exceeded, the recording stops automatically. The value range is [1,720]. Agora recommend that you set a value smaller than the value of `resourceExpiredHour` specified in the `acquire` method.
  The charging will continue until the web page recording stops. You should set a reasonable `maxRecordingHour` based on the actual business scenario or actively stop the web page recording.
  - `maxVideoDuration`: (Optional) Number. Sets the maximum duration (in minutes) of the MP4 slice file generated by the web page recording. The value range is [30,240], and the default value is 120 minutes. During a web page recording, when the length of the recorded file reaches around `maxVideoDuration`, the recording service creates another MP4 slice file.
  - `onhold`: (Optional) Bool. Sets whether to pause the web page recording when starting the web page recording task.
  - `true`：Pauses the web page recording when starting the web page recording task. After the web page recording task is started, the web page recording is paused immediately. The recording service opens and renders the page to be recorded, but does not generate a slice file.
  - (Default) `false`: Starts the web page recording task and continue web page recording.
> Agora recommends that you use the `onhold` parameter as follows:
When calling the `start` method, set the `onhold` parameter to `true`, start and pause the web page recording, determine the appropriate time to start the web page recording, and call the `update` method and set the `onhold` parameter to `false` to continue the web page recording.
If you need to continuously call the `update` method to pause or resume page recording, call it after receiving the last HTTP response of `update`; otherwise the actual result may be inconsistent with your expectation.
- `readyTimeout`: (optional) Number. Sets the web page loading timeout limit, in seconds.The value range is [0,60].
- 0 or null, which means the web page loading status is not detected.
- An integer greater than or equal to 1, which sets the web page load timeout limit.
  If you set `readyTimeout` to less than 0 or a non-integer, an error code `2` is received.

**Push media stream to the CDN during a web page recording**
When pushing media stream to the CDN during a web page recording, `extensionServices` includes fields of web page recording and streaming. The fields of streaming are as follows:

- `serviceName`: String. The name of the extension service. To use web page recording, set it as "rtmp_publish_service".
- `errorHandlePolicy`: (Optional) String. Error handling policy. Currently you can only set it to the default value, "error_ignore", which means that if an error occurs to the current extension service, other extension services are not affected.
- `serviceParam`: JSON. Configurations for an extension service. To push media stream to the CDN during a web page recording, configure as follows:
- `outputs`：JSON Array. Configure as follows:
  - `rtmpUrl`：String. The CDN address which you want to push stream to.
