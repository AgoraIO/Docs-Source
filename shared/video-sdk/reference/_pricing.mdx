This page introduces the new billing strategy for <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="NAME"/> and the updated billing model in the <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- Starting August xx, 2025, when you create a new project in the <Vg k="CONSOLE"/>, all existing projects under your account will automatically switch to the new billing model. If the switch fails, contact [`support@agora.io`](mailto:support@agora.io).
- If you don’t create a new project after August xx, 2025, your projects will continue to use the old billing model. For details, see [Legacy pricing](pricing-legacy).
- If you’ve signed a sales contract with <Vg k="COMPANY"/>, your billing will follow the terms in the contract.
</Admonition>

<Vg k="COMPANY"/>'s <Vpd k="NAME" /> services are billed monthly. At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates usage fees for all projects under the [<Vg k="CONSOLE"/>](https://console.agora.io).

Billing for <Vpd k="NAME" /> includes charges for the following service categories:

* **Basic services**: Audio and video subscription services for hosts and audience.
* **Value-added services**: Independently billed services such as screenshot uploads, co-host across channels, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> Hybrid Cloud, and other media services.

The billing structure is shown below:

![Billing structure](/images/video-sdk/pricing-structure.jpg)

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> settles the previous month’s charges on the 1st day of each month. If a monthly payment is required, deductions occur on the 6th day of the month.

![Package usage workflow](/images/video-sdk/pricing-workflow.svg)

## Basic services

To simplify billing, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> converts basic service usage into a standard duration and settles fees accordingly. All audio and video subscriptions measured using this standard duration.

For calculation details and conversion coefficients, see:

* [Standard Duration](#standard-duration)
* [Collective Resolution](#collective-resolution)

Different stream resolutions contribute differently to the standard duration calculation.

### Usage calculation

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses *standard minutes* to measure usage for all products. Each audio minute and video resolution is converted into standard duration according to the following conversion ratios:

| Service Type | List Price/1000 min | Conversion Ratio |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Audio minute | $0.99 | 1 |
| Video HD | $3.99 | 1:4 |
| Video Full HD | $8.99 | 1:9 |
| Video 2K | $15.99 | 1:16 |
| Video 2K+ | $35.99 | 1:36 |
| Broadcast Streaming Audience Audio | $0.59 | 1:0.57 |
| Broadcast Streaming Audience Video HD | $1.99 | 1:2 |
| Broadcast Streaming Audience Video Full HD | $4.59 | 1:4.57 |
| Broadcast Streaming Audience Video 2K | $7.99 | 1:8 |
| Broadcast Streaming Audience Video 2K+ | $17.99 | 1:18 |

### Subscription fees within a package

You can deduct basic service usage from available packages. If you don’t purchase a package, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides a **default free package** that includes **10,000 standard minutes**.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
- After subscribing to a paid package, you will no longer receive the **10,000 free minutes**.
- Different packages support different advanced features. Purchase a package that fits your business needs. For details, see [Feature availability by plan](#feature-availability-by-plan).

#### Additional usage

If your usage exceeds your subscribed plan, you can:

* Purchase a [refuelling package](#refueling-packages) (recommended)
* Use monthly postpaid billing

### Refueling packages

If you’ve purchased a top-up package, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> will **automatically deduct** from it when your plan is exceeded.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- If purchased **before the 1st of the month**, the package can cover usage from the previous month  
- The billing system deducts usage on the 6th of each month.  
  - From the 1st to 6th: shows remaining balance after last month’s settlement.  
  - From the 7th onward: shows balance after current month’s deduction.
</Admonition>


<Vg k="COMPANY" /> offers the following refueling (top-up) packages:

| Minutes      | Price  | Discount |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| 25,000	     | $23.5	|      5%  |
| 250,000	     | $247.5	|      7%  |
| 1,000,000	   | $990.0	|      10% |

- Refuelling minutes remain valid for a calendar year.
- You can apply a refuelling package to any plan, including the Free package.

#### Monthly postpaid billing

If your actual usage for the month exceeds both the subscription and top-up packages, the billing system:

* Converts the overage into standard minutes
* Charges 0.99 per 1,000 standard minutes at the time of settlement

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
- Ensure your account has sufficient balance to prevent service interruption due to non-payment.
- To switch to postpaid billing, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).
</Admonition>

### Billing example

User A purchases the **Ultimate Plan** on **August 15, 2024**, and enables **automatic renewal**.

* **August 15**: On purchase, User A pays
  `¥8,399 × (17 / 31) = ¥4,605.90` for the remaining days in August.
* **August 25**: The September plan is automatically renewed.
  `¥8,399` is deducted from the balance.
* **September 1**: August usage exceeds the plan by **100,000 minutes**.
  `100,000 ÷ 1,000 × ¥7 = ¥70` is automatically deducted from the account.

## Value-added service fees

In addition to basic service charges, <Vg k="VSDK"/> may incur additional costs when value-added services are used.

### Local screenshot upload

The local screenshot upload feature captures screenshots of video streams in a channel at set intervals and uploads them to a specified third-party cloud storage service.

<ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
For implementation details, see the [Local Screenshot Upload guide](..//advanced-features/screenshot-upload).
</ProductWrapper>

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> charges local screenshot upload based on two metrics:

* **Screenshot fee**
* **QPS overage fee** (queries per second)

At the end of each month, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates:

* The **total number of screenshots** generated
* The **monthly peak QPS** if it exceeds the free quota

**Billing formula:**

```
Monthly fee = (Number of screenshots - free quota) × Screenshot unit price
            + (Monthly peak QPS - free QPS) × QPS overage unit price
```

#### Pricing

| Billing Type       | Unit Price               | Discount Policy            |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Screenshot Fee     | 2 CNY per 10,000 images  | Includes a free quota of 10,000 images per month                                |
| QPS Overage Fee    | 10 CNY per QPS           | Includes 500 QPS per month: <br/> - ≤ 500 QPS: No charge <br/> - > 500 QPS: Charged based on monthly peak QPS |


#### Example

* **Example 1:**
  A project generates **910,000 screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **100**
  → Fee = (91 - 1) × 2 = **180 CNY**

* **Example 2:**
  A project generates **2.91 million screenshots** in one month. Peak QPS = **600**
  → Fee = (291 - 1) × 2 + (600 - 500) × 10 = **1580 CNY**

### Cross-channel media stream relay

The cross-channel media stream relay feature forwards a host’s media stream from the source channel to one or more target channels in real time.

<ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>

For implementation details, see the [Cross-channel media stream relay](../advanced-features/cross-channel-media-relay).

</ProductWrapper>

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> charges based on **stream duration** and **forwarded video resolution**.

**Billing formula:**

```
Monthly fee = Total forwarding duration × Unit price (based on resolution)
```

#### Duration

* Calculated from the start to the end of the forwarding task.
* For multiple target channels, duration is multiplied by the number of targets.
* If the host stops publishing media but does not stop forwarding, billing continues based on **audio usage**.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
- Forwarding to **N target channels** (N ≤ 6) multiplies the forwarding time by N.
- The resolution used for billing is based on the **forwarded stream**, not the subscriber’s aggregate resolution.
</Admonition>

#### Pricing

| Usage Type | Video Resolution            | Unit Price (CNY / 1,000 minutes) |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Audio      | -                           | 7 CNY                            |
| HD Video   | ≤ 1280 × 720                | 28 CNY                           |
| Full HD    | ≤ 1920 × 1080               | 63 CNY                           |
| 2K         | ≤ 2560 × 1440               | 112 CNY                          |
| 2K+        | > 2560 × 1440               | 252 CNY                          |


#### Example

* **Example 1:**
  
  Forwarding a 1280 × 720 video stream to **3 target channels** for **10 minutes**
  → Duration: 30 minutes
  → Fee: 30 × 28 / 1,000 = **0.84 CNY**

* **Example 2:**
  
  Forwarding **audio only** to **3 target channels** for **10 minutes**
  → Duration: 30 minutes
  → Fee: 30 × 7 / 1,000 = **0.21 CNY**

### Aggregate resolution

Aggregate resolution refers to the total resolution of all video streams subscribed to by a user.

**Example**:

A user subscribes to two streams:
    * 1280 × 720
    * 1920 × 1080

The aggregate resolution is: `1280 × 720 + 1920 × 1080 = 2,995,200`

Usage is billed as **2K video** based on this resolution.

| Subscription Type | Aggregate Resolution                            | Usage Tier    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Audio Only        | –                                               | Audio         |
| Video             | ≤ 921,600 (e.g., 1280 × 720)                    | HD Video      |
| Video             | 921,600 < res ≤ 2,073,600 (e.g., 1920 × 1080)   | Full HD Video |
| Video             | 2,073,600 < res ≤ 3,686,400 (e.g., 2560 × 1440) | 2K Video      |
| Video             | > 3,686,400                                     | 2K+ Video     |


### Standard duration calculation

Standard duration is used for unified billing and is calculated using the following formula:

**Standard Duration** = `Usage Time × Conversion Coefficient`

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="native-sdk" label="Native, Web, Framework Video SDK">

| Role                    | Audio | HD Video | Full HD | 2K | 2K+ |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | -- | --- |
| Host                  | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Interactive Live Audience | 1     | 4        | 9       | 16 | 36  |
| Speed Live Audience       | 0.57  | 2        | 4.57    | 8  | 18  |

When actual usage is converted to standard duration, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates the total at the second level and rounds up the final result to the nearest whole number (minute).

**Example:**

* The host’s HD video usage is 60 seconds
  → Standard duration: 60 × 4 = **240 seconds**
* The audience’s audio usage is 360 seconds
  → Standard duration: 360 × 0.57 = **205.2 seconds**
* **Total:** 240 + 205.2 = 445.2 seconds = **7.42 minutes** → Final billed: **8 minutes**

<Admonition type="info" info="info">
This example is for illustrative purposes only. The actual billed duration is based on your project’s monthly report.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="miniapp-sdk" label="Mini Program Video SDK">

| Role                    | Audio | HD Video |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Host               | 1.43  | 4.29     |
| Interactive Live audience | 1.43  | 4.29     |

<Vg k="COMPANY"/> calculates billing based on **standard duration**, which is derived from the actual usage in seconds. The total is then rounded **up to the nearest whole minute**.

**Example**: 

* The host's HD video usage is **60 seconds**. The HD video conversion factor is `4`, so the standard duration is:
  `60 × 4 = 240 seconds`

* An audience’s audio usage is **360 seconds**. The audio conversion factor is `0.57`, so the standard duration is:
  `360 × 0.57 = 205.2 seconds`

* The **total standard duration** is:
  `240 + 205.2 = 445.2 seconds` → `7.42 minutes`

* After rounding up, the final billing duration is:
  **8 minutes**

### FAQs
This section describes common billing-related issues and their solutions.

#### Free minutes

<details>
<summary>If I purchase a paid package, will I still get 10,000 free minutes each month?</summary>

**Answer**: No.

When you purchase a paid package, the free minutes are included in the package itself. Higher-tier packages offer more free minutes. The default 10,000 free minutes per month no longer apply.

For details, see [Pricing](pricing-strategy) listed in the package.
</details>

#### Billing
<details>
<summary>If a user doesn’t publish or subscribe to any audio or video streams in a channel, will they be charged?</summary>

**Answer**:
Yes. Audio subscription fees will apply.

There is no charge for publishing audio or video streams. However, even if a user does not actively subscribe to any streams, audio usage time is still generated in the channel, which results in audio subscription fees.
</details>

#### Duration and usage
<details>
<summary>How is usage duration calculated in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**:

Agora tracks usage in seconds and then converts it to minutes for billing. At the end of each month, it calculates the total audio and video usage in seconds, divides each by 60, and rounds up to the nearest whole minute.

For example:

* If you use 59 seconds of audio, it is billed as **1 minute**.
* If you use 61 seconds of video, it is billed as **2 minutes**.

The rounding error per month is within **1 minute**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I view individual user usage in the bill?</summary>

**Answer**: No.

The bill only shows the total audio and video usage for all users across all projects under your Agora developer account.

To check usage for an individual user, use the statistics reported by the SDK:

* **Android:** `onRtcStats` callback → `totalDuration` property
* **iOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **Windows:** `onRtcStats` callback → `duration` property
* **macOS:** `reportRtcStats` callback → `duration` property

<Admonition type="Note" info="info">
If the client disconnects due to a weak network, the call duration reported by the Agora RTC SDK might be inaccurate.
To improve accuracy, implement a heartbeat mechanism using the Agora RTM SDK or another signaling system. Subtract the disconnection time from the RTC-reported duration to get a more precise call duration for the user.
</Admonition>
</details>

#### Video resolution

<details>
<summary>Why is my billing rate set to ultra-high-definition when all users subscribe to 360 × 640 video streams?</summary>

**Answer**:

Billing is based on the aggregate resolution, which is the total resolution of all subscribed video streams combined.

Even if each individual stream is **360 × 640**, subscribing to multiple streams can cause the aggregate resolution to exceed **1,280 × 720**, which qualifies as ultra-high-definition (UHD) under Agora’s billing rules.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How is video stream resolution calculated in dual-stream mode?</summary>

**Answer**:

In dual-stream mode, a user's video resolution is calculated based on the type of stream received:

* If subscribed to the high-quality (large) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the resolution set by the sender.
* If subscribed to the low-quality (small) stream, the aggregate resolution is based on the actual resolution received.
* If the high-quality stream is requested but the low-quality stream is delivered—for example, due to a weak network—the resolution is still calculated based on the actual resolution of the stream received.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How can I determine the resolution of a screen sharing video stream?</summary>

**Answer**:

The resolution of a screen sharing video stream is determined by the video resolution you set in the relevant API or class. If no resolution is specified, the default resolution is used for billing.

| **Platform** | **Class or Configuration**                 | **Default Resolution** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |

<summary>What is resolution calibration?</summary>

**Answer**:

Resolution calibration refers to adjusting the resolution of a video stream to a standard value when calculating aggregate resolution.

For example, a video stream with a resolution of **640 × 352** (225,280 pixels) is rounded up and treated as **640 × 360** (230,400 pixels) for billing purposes.

<summary>What should I do if my account is frozen due to an outstanding balance?</summary>

**Answer**:

If your account is frozen, you need to recharge it promptly. Once your balance meets or exceeds the minimum required amount, the account will be automatically unfrozen.

To avoid service interruptions, we recommend monitoring deduction emails, recharge reminders, and account freeze warnings sent by Agora.
