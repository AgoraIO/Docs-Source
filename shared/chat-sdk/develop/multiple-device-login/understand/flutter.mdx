| Single-device login | The newly logged-in device will force the current device to log out. The logged-out device will receive the `ConnectionEventHandler#onUserDidLoginTooManyDevice` event. | For devices that log in automatically, the device will automatically reconnect to the Agora server after going offline. If the reconnection is successful, the current logged-in device will be forced to log out by default (for multiple devices, the earliest logged-in device will be logged out). If you want to keep the current device logged in, contact support@agora.io. In this scenario, the device that logs in automatically won't be able to log in and will receive error 214, indicating that the number of currently logged-in devices exceeds the limit. |
| Multi-device login | If the number of logged-in devices reaches the limit, the device that logged in the latest will force the device that logged in the earliest to log out. The logged-out device will receive the `ConnectionEventHandler#onUserDidLoginTooManyDevice` event. Agora Chat only supports forced logout for the devices on the same end. | For devices that log in automatically, the device will automatically reconnect to the Agora server after going offline.
