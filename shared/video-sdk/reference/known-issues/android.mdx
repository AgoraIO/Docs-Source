This page lists the known issues and limitations of using the Android SDK.

This page is continuously updated as the systems evolve. Agora suggests you regularly upgrade to the latest version of the SDK, which includes new features, bug fixes and improvements.

### Android SDK v4.2.3

**Android 14 screen sharing issue**

On Android 14 devices, such as OnePlus 11, screen sharing may not be available when `targetSdkVersion` is set to `34`. For example, half of the shared screen may be black. To avoid this issue, Agora recommends setting `targetSdkVersion` to 34 or below. However, this may cause the screen sharing process to be interrupted when switching between portrait and landscape mode. In this case, a window will pop up on the device asking if you want to start recording the screen. After confirming, you can resume screen sharing.
