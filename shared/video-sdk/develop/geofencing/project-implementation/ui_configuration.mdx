1. When creating a project, expand **Advanced Configuration**.

2. Under **Geo-Fencing**, select one of the following options:

* **Global**: Select to include all territories.
* **Designated areas**: Select the territories where SDK is specifically **allowed** to connect to Agora servers.
* **Excluded areas**: Select the territories where SDK is specifically **not allowed** to connect to Agora servers.
