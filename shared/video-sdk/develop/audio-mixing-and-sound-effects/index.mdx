<Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some real-time audio and video scenarios, such as games or karaoke, you need to play sound effects or mix in music files to enhance the atmosphere and add interest. <Vpd k="SDK" /> enables you to add sound effects and mix in pre-recorded audio.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android, ios, macos, web, windows">
This page shows you how to implement audio mixing and playing sound effects in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Understand the tech

<Vpd k="SDK" /> provides APIs that enable you to implement:

    * **Audio mixing**: Mix in music file such as background music with microphone audio. Using audio mixing, you can play only one file at a time.

    * **Sound effects**: Play audios with a short duration. For example, applause, cheers, or gunshots. You can play multiple sound effects at the same time.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have: 

* Implemented the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project.

<PlatformWrapper platform="android">
* Audio files in one of the [supported file formats](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/supported-formats).

* Added the required permission to your project

    If your project's `targetSdkVersion` is greater than 20, add the following code to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
        ```xml
        <application>
            <!-- Other application settings -->
            android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
            android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
        </application>
        ```
