By default, <Vg k="VSDK" /> uses the basic audio and video modules on the device your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> runs on. However, there are certain scenarios where you want to integrate a custom audio or video source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, such as:

* Your app has its own audio or video module.
* You want to use a non-camera source, such as recorded screen data.
* You need to process the captured audio or video with a pre-processing library for audio or image enhancement.
* You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

## Understand the tech

To set an external audio or video source, you configure the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> before joining a channel. To manage the capture and processing of audio and video frames, you use methods from outside the <Vg k="VSDK" /> that are specific to your custom source. <Vg k="VSDK" /> enables you to push processed audio and video data to the subscribers in a channel.

The figure below shows the workflow you need to implement to stream a custom video or audio source in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link>

## Project setup

To create the environment necessary to implement call quality best practice into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with <Vpd k="NAME"/></Link> project you created previously.

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />

To stream video or audio from a custom source, you convert the data stream into a suitable format and push this data using <Vg k="VSDK" />. 

<ProjectImplement />


## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented streaming from a custom video or audio source into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _Join_.
