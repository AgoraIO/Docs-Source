## Releases

### v1.8

Released on October 31, 2025.

#### New features

* **Keyword interruption mode**

    This release adds a new option to the `turn_detection.interrupt_mode` field in the [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join) API. Set this field to `"keyword"` to enable keyword interruption mode.

    When this mode is enabled, the agent stops its current behavior after detecting any of the keywords specified in the `turn_detection.interrupt_keywords` field.

* **Adaptive interruption mode**

    This release adds a new option to the `turn_detection.interrupt_mode` field in the [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join) API. Set this field to `"adaptive"` to enable adaptive interruption mode.

    When this mode is enabled, the agent dynamically increases the voice continuity threshold while speaking to reduce accidental interruptions.

### v1.7

Released on July 31, 2025.

#### New features

* **AI avatars**

    Create visual avatar representations for your conversational agents using third-party avatar providers. AI avatars provide a visual presence during voice interactions, making conversations feel more natural and engaging. Enable AI avatars by setting `avatar.enable` to `true` and configuring the `avatar.vendor` and `avatar.params` fields when calling [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join) to create your agent.

    <Admonition type="info">
    AI avatars require video streaming and incur additional charges. See [video calling pricing](/video-calling/overview/pricing) for details.
    </Admonition>

* **Selective attention locking** (Beta)

    This version introduces the selective attention locking feature, which uses voiceprint recognition technology to identify and filter out the speaker while suppressing background noise. This enhances the efficiency of conversational AI, particularly improving speech recognition accuracy. To experience this feature, contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io). 

* **Send picture messages** (Beta)

    The toolkit now includes an API for [sending picture messages](../develop/send-multimodal-messages.mdx).

### v1.5

Released on Jun 9, 2025.

#### New features

* **Voice interruption mode**

    This release adds the `turn_detection.interrupt_mode` parameter to the [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join) API, allowing you to control how the agent handles human voice interruptions. The following modes are supported:

    * **`interrupt`**: (Default) The human voice immediately interrupts the agent. The agent terminates the current interaction and processes the new human voice input.

    * **`append`**: The human voice does not interrupt the agent. The agent processes the newly received human voice request after the current interaction ends.

    * **`ignore`**: The agent ignores human voice requests received during speaking or thinking. These requests are discarded and not stored in the context.
    
* **TTS filtering**

    This release adds the `tts.skip_patterns` parameter to the [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join) API. This parameter controls whether the TTS module skips bracketed content when reading LLM response text. This prevents the agent from vocalizing structural prompt information like tone indicators, action descriptions, and system prompts, creating a more natural and immersive listening experience.

#### API changes

This release introduces several important modifications to the RESTful API.

- [Start a conversational AI agent](../rest-api/join)
    - **New parameters added:**
        - `turn_detection.interrupt_mode`
        - `parameters.silence_config`
        - `tts.skip_patterns`

### v1.4

    - **New parameters added:**
        - `llm.system_messages`
        - `llm.params`

### v1.3

Released on April 16, 2025.

#### New features

- **Agent conversation history**: This version adds two methods to retrieve an agent’s history. The history includes messages exchanged between the user and the agent and timestamps of agent creation and exit.

    - Call the RESTful API `history` endpoint to [Retrieve agent history](../rest-api/history).

    - Subscribe to the [agent history event](../develop/event-types#103-agent-history) through the [Agora message notification service](../develop/event-notifications). When the agent stops, Agora automatically sends the agent's history to your business server through a Webhook callback.

#### Improvements

- **Customize the priority of broadcast information**: This version upgrades the [Broadcast a message using TTS](../rest-api/speak) interface and adds two new configuration parameters related to broadcast interruption logic:

    - `priority`: Sets the priority of the message broadcast. Supports setting the following priorities: 
        - `INTERRUPT` High priority
        - `APPEND`: Medium priority
        - `IGNORE`: Low priority

    - `interruptable`: Configure whether to allow human voice to interrupt the agent's broadcast.

#### API changes

- Adds the [Retrieve agent history](../rest-api/history) method.
- Adds `priority` and `interruptable` parameters to the [Broadcast a message using TTS](../rest-api/speak) method.

### v1.2

Released on April 10, 2025.

#### New features

- **Broadcast a message using TTS**: A new message broadcast interface enables a specified agent to deliver a custom message. When interacting with an agent, calling this interface interrupts the agent’s speech and thinking process, allowing the TTS module to immediately broadcast the custom message.

- **Interrupt the agent**: The interrupt agent endpoint allows you to stop the specified agent’s speech and thinking process.

#### API changes

This version adds the following APIs:
- [Broadcast a message using TTS](../rest-api/speak)
- [Interrupt the agent](../rest-api/interrupt)

### v1.1

Released on March 27, 2025.

#### New features

The [Start a conversational agent](../rest-api/join) API adds the `enable_rtm`and `agent_rtm_uid` parameters to enable Signaling integration with <Vpd k="AGENT" />. When this feature is enabled, the agent can leverage the Signaling SDK to obtain a users's custom context information such as speaking status, selected text, signature, and score, and pass this data to the agent to generate more relevant content. For details, see [Transmit custom information](../develop/custom-information).

#### Improvements

To help you quickly integrate a custom large language model (LLM), this version adds documentation for [Custom LLMs](../develop/custom-llm). Refer to the sample code in the documentation to integrate your custom model into the <Vpd k="NAME" /> and enable advanced capabilities such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal processing, and tool invocation.
