To improve the communication security between the Agora NCS server and your server, Agora uses signatures for identity verification. The following steps show how to verify a signature:

1. When you configure the NCS on the Agora Console, Agora generates a Secret. You need to save it for signature verification.
2. When sending a notification callback to your server, the Agora NCS server generates two signature values by using the secret and the `HMAC/SHA1` and `HMAC/SHA256` algorithms, and then it adds the signature values to the `Agora-Signature` and `Agora-Signature-V2` fields of the HTTPS request header.
3. After receiving the notification callback, you can verify either `Agora-Signature` or `Agora-Signature`-V2. To verify Agora-Signature,use the secret, the raw request body, and the `HMAC/SHA1` algorithm; to verify `Agora-Signature-V2`, use the secret, the raw request body,and the `HMAC/SHA2` algorithm.

You can refer to the following signature verification code samples:
