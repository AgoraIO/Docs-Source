## Implementation

In a complete call invitation process, the call invitation states of the caller and the callee are defined by `LocalInvitation` and `RemoteInvitation,` respectively.

### Send a call invitation

The steps to send a call invitation are as follows:

1.  The caller creates the `LocalInvitation` by calling `createLocalInvitation`; at the same time, the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` begins.

2.  The caller sends a call invitation by calling `sendLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` begins as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationReceived` callback, and then the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationReceivedByPeer` callback.

    The sample code for sending a call invitation is as follows:

    ```java
    // Gets RtmCallManager instance
    RtmCallManager = RtmClient.getRtmCallManager();

    void inviteCall(final String peerUid, final String channel) {
        // Creates LocalInvitation
        LocalInvitation invitation = RtmCallManager.createLocalInvitation(peerUid);
        invitation.setContent(channel);
        // Sends call invitation
        RtmCallManager.sendLocalInvitation(invitation);
    }
    ```

### Cancel a call invitation

The caller cancels the call invitation by calling `cancelLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the callee receives the `onRemoteInvitationCanceled` callback. And then the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationCanceled` callback.

The sample code for canceling a call invitation is as follows:

    ```java
    // Cancel a call invitation.
    void cancelLocalInvitation() {
            if (RtmCallManager != null && invitation != null) {
                RtmCallManager.cancelLocalInvitation(invitation);
            }
        }
    ```

### Accept a call invitation

The callee gets `RemoteInvitation` from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and accepts the call invitation by calling `acceptRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationAccepted` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationAccepted` callback.

The sample code for accepting a call invitation is as follows:
    ```java
    // Accept a call invitation.
    void answerCall(final RemoteInvitation invitation) {
            if (RtmCallManager != null && invitation != null) {
                RtmCallManager.acceptRemoteInvitation(invitation);
            }
        }
    ```


### Refuse a call invitation

The callee gets `RemoteInvitation` from `onRemoteInvitationReceived` and refuses the call invitation by calling `refuseRemoteInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onRemoteInvitationRefused` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `onLocalInvitationRefused` callback.

The sample code for refusing a call invitation is as follows:

    ```java
    // Refuse a call invitation.
    void refuseRemoteInvitation(@NonNull RemoteInvitation invitation) {
            if (RtmCallManager != null) {
                RtmCallManager.refuseRemoteInvitation(invitation);
            }
        }
    ```
