  How to develop applications with the TEN framework .
---

The TEN framework supports two development approaches:

1. Building from extensions to scenarios
2. Adapting existing scenarios with custom extensions

<Admonition type="info">
With either approach, you can create your own extensions or use pre-built extensions from the TEN cloud store.

### Building from extensions to scenarios

This approach involves:

1. Developing individual extensions
2. Assembling extensions into a graph
3. Creating an agent (for example, [TEN-Agent](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent))

### Adapting existing scenarios with custom extensions

This approach involves:

1. Selecting an agent template (for example, [TEN-Agent](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent))
2. Replacing specific extensions with your custom versions

Use the standalone testing framework to ensure your custom extensions match the behavior of the original ones. This allows you to focus solely on extension development concepts without needing to understand other TEN-related concepts, as these are encapsulated within the selected agent.
