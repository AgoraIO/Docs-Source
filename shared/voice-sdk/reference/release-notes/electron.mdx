### v4.3.1

v4.3.1 was released on May 9, 2024.

#### New features

1. **Data stream encryption**

   This version adds `datastreamEncryptionEnabled` to <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_encryptionconfig.html">EncryptionConfig</Link> for enabling data stream encryption. You can set this when you activate encryption with <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enableencryption">enableEncryption</Link>. If there are issues causing failure in data stream encryption or decryption, these can be identified by the newly added `EncryptionErrorDatastreamDecryptionFailure` and `EncryptionErrorDatastreamEncryptionFailure` enumerations.

1. **Other features**

   - A new method <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengineex.html#api_irtcengineex_enableencryptionex">enableEncryptionEx</Link> is added for enabling media stream or data stream encryption in multi-channel scenarios.
   - A new method <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setaudiomixingplaybackspeed">setAudioMixingPlaybackSpeed</Link> is introduced for setting the playback speed of audio files.
   - A new method <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengineex.html#api_irtcengineex_getcallidex">getCallIdEx</Link> is introduced for retrieving call IDs in multi-channel scenarios.

#### Improvements

1. **Audio device type detection (macOS)**

   This version adds the `deviceTypeName` in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_audiodeviceinfo.html">AudioDeviceInfo</Link>, used to identify the type of audio devices, such as built-in, USB, HDMI, and so on.

1. **CPU consumption reduction of in-ear monitoring**

   This release adds an enumerator `EarMonitoringFilterReusePostProcessingFilter` in `EarMonitoringFilterType`. For complex audio processing scenarios, you can specify this option to reuse the audio filter post sender-side processing in in-ear monitoring, thereby reducing CPU consumption. Note that this option may increase the latency of in-ear monitoring, which is suitable for latency-tolerant scenarios requiring low CPU consumption.

1. **Other improvements**

   This version also includes the following improvements:

   - In <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/enum_audioeffectpreset.html">AudioEffectPreset</Link>, a new enumeration `RoomAcousticsChorus` (chorus effect) is added, enhancing the spatial presence of vocals in chorus scenarios.
   - In <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_remoteaudiostats.html">RemoteAudioStats</Link>, a new `e2eDelay` field is added to report the delay from when the audio is captured on the sending side to when the audio is played on the receiving side.

#### Issues fixed

This version fixed the following issues:

- In audio-video interactions, if a user inserted headphones into the device and manually switched the system audio output to speakers, and later the app called <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_iaudiodevicemanager.html#api_iaudiodevicemanager_setplaybackdevice">setPlaybackDevice</Link> to specify the headphone as the audio playback device, audio output did not switch back to speakers as expected after the headphones were removed (macOS).
- During interactions, when a local user set the system default playback device to speakers, there was no sound from the remote end  (Windows).

#### API changes

### v4.3.0

v4.3.0 was released on February 28, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

This release has optimized the implementation of some functions, involving renaming or deletion of some APIs. To ensure the normal operation of the project, update the code in the app after upgrading to this release.

1. **Renaming parameters in callbacks**

   In order to make the parameters in some callbacks and the naming of enumerations in enumeration classes easier to understand, the following modifications have been made in this release. Modify the parameter settings in the callbacks after upgrading to this release.

   | Callback                           | Original parameter name | New parameter name |
   | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
   | `onLocalAudioStateChanged`         | `error`                 | `reason`                |
   | `onLocalVideoStateChanged`         | `error`                 | `reason`                |
   | `onDirectCdnStreamingStateChanged` | `error`                 | `reason`                |
   | `onRtmpStreamingStateChanged`      | `errCode`               | `reason`                |

   | Original enumeration class   | New enumeration class  |
   | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
   | `LocalAudioStreamError`      | `LocalAudioStreamReason`   |
   | `LocalVideoStreamError`      | `LocalVideoStreamReason`   |
   | `DirectCdnStreamingError`    | `DirectCdnStreamingReason` |
   | `MediaPlayerError`           | `MediaPlayerReason`        |
   | `RtmpStreamPublishErrorType` | `RtmpStreamPublishReason`  |

   **Note:** For specific renaming of enumerations, please refer to [API changes](#api-changes).

1. **Channel media relay**

   To improve interface usability, this release removes some methods and callbacks for channel media relay. Use the alternative options listed in the table below:

   | Deleted methods and callbacks                         | Alternative methods and callbacks  |
   | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | `startChannelMediaRelay`,`updateChannelMediaRelay`     | `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`   |
   | `startChannelMediaRelayEx`,`updateChannelMediaRelayEx` | `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` |
   | `onChannelMediaRelayEvent`                            | `onChannelMediaRelayStateChanged`  |

1. **Log encryption behavior changes**

    For security and performance reasons, as of this release, the SDK encrypts logs and no longer supports printing plaintext logs via the console.

    Refer to the following solutions for different needs:

      - If you need to know the API call status, please check the API logs and print the SDK callback logs yourself.
      - For any other special requirements, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io) and provide the corresponding encrypted logs.

1. **Audio loopback capturing**

   - Before v4.3.0, if you call the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_disableaudio">disableAudio</Link> method to disable the audio module, audio loopback capturing will not be disabled.
   - As of v4.3.0, if you call the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_disableaudio">disableAudio</Link> method to disable the audio module, audio loopback capturing will be disabled as well. If you need to enable audio loopback capturing, you need to enable the audio module by calling the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enableaudio">enableAudio</Link> method and then call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enableloopbackrecording">enableLoopbackRecording</Link>.

#### New features

1. **Query Device Score**

   This release adds the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_querydevicescore">queryDeviceScore</Link> method to query the device's score level to ensure that the user-set parameters do not exceed the device's capabilities. For example, in HD or UHD video scenarios, you can first call this method to query the device's score. If the returned score is low (for example, below 60), you need to lower the video resolution to avoid affecting the video experience. The minimum device score required for different business scenarios is varied. For specific score recommendations, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

1. **Select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming**

   This release introduces the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_Imediaplayer_selectmultiaudiotrack">selectMultiAudioTrack</Link> method that allows you to select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming to remote users. For example, in scenarios like online karaoke, the host can choose to play the original sound locally and publish the accompaniment in the channel. Before using this function, you need to open the media file through the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_imediaplayer.html#api_imediaplayer_openwithmediasource">openWithMediaSource</Link> method and enable this function by setting the `enableMultiAudioTrack` parameter in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_mediasource.html">MediaSource</Link>.

1. **Others**

   This release has passed the test verification of the following APIs and can be applied to the entire series of RTC 4.x SDK.

   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_iaudiodevicemanager.html#api_iaudiodevicemanager_setplaybackdevicevolume">setPlaybackDeviceVolume</Link>: Sets the volume of the audio playback device.
   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_iaudiodevicemanager.html#api_iaudiodevicemanager_getrecordingdevicevolume">getRecordingDeviceVolume</Link>: Sets the volume of the audio capturing device.

   - <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_enablecustomaudiolocalplayback">enableCustomAudioLocalPlayback</Link>: Sets whether to enable the local playback of external audio source.

#### Improvements

1. **SDK task processing scheduling optimization**

   This release optimizes the scheduling mechanism for internal tasks within the SDK, with improvements in the following aspects:

   - The speed of video rendering and audio playback for both remote and local first frames improves by 10% to 20%.
   - The API call duration and response time are reduced by 5% to 50%.
   - The SDK's parallel processing capability significantly improves, delivering higher video quality (720P, 24 fps) even on lower-end devices. Additionally, image processing remains more stable in scenarios involving high resolutions and frame rates.
   - The stability of the SDK is further enhanced, leading to a noticeable decrease in the crash rate across various specific scenarios.

1. **In-ear monitoring volume boost**

   This release provides users with more flexible in-ear monitoring audio adjustment options, supporting the ability to set the in-ear monitoring volume to four times the original volume by calling <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setinearmonitoringvolume">setInEarMonitoringVolume</Link>.

1. **Spatial audio effects usability improvement**

   - This release optimizes the design of the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_ibasespatialaudioengine.html#api_ibasespatialaudioengine_setzones">setZones</Link> method, supporting the ability to set the `zones` parameter to `NULL`, indicating the clearing of all echo cancellation zones.
   - As of this release, it is no longer necessary to unsubscribe from the audio streams of all remote users within the channel before calling the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_ilocalspatialaudioengine.html#class_ilocalspatialaudioengine">ILocalSpatialAudioEngine</Link> method.

1. **Other Improvements**

   This release also includes the following improvements:

   - This release optimizes the SDK's domain name resolution strategy, improving the stability of calling to resolve domain names in complex network environments.
   - This release adds the `earMonitorDelay` and `aecEstimatedDelay` members in <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_localaudiostats.html">LocalAudioStats</Link> to report ear monitor delay and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) delay, respectively.
   - The <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_imediaplayersourceobserver.html#callback_imediaplayersourceobserver_onplayercachestats">onPlayerCacheStats</Link> callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being cached. This callback is triggered once per second after file caching is started.
   - The <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_imediaplayersourceobserver.html#callback_imediaplayersourceobserver_onplayerplaybackstats">onPlayerPlaybackStats</Link> callback is added to report the statistics of the media file being played. This callback is triggered once per second after the media file starts playing. You can obtain information like the audio and video bitrate of the media file through <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ELECTRON_ROOT_VOICE_SDK}}/class_playerplaybackstats.html">PlayerPlaybackStats</Link>.

### v4.2.6

v4.2.6 was released on November 24, 2023.

#### Issues fixed

This version fixed the issue of stuttering or frozen video on the receiving end in specific scenarios, such as when the network packet loss rate was high, or when the broadcaster left the channel without destroying the engine and then re-joined the channel.

### v4.2.4

v4.2.4 was released on October 25, 2023.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issue:

The `AgoraRtcWrapper` version number in `CFBundleShortVersionString` on macOS is wrong, which interferes with submitting the App to the App Store.

### v4.2.3

v4.2.3 was released on October 20, 2023.

#### Improvements

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Optimizes the logic of handling invalid parameters. When you call the `setPlaybackSpeed` method to set the playback speed of audio files, if you pass an invalid parameter, the SDK returns the error code `-2`, which means that you need to reset the parameter.
- Optimizes the logic of Token parsing, in order to prevent an app from crashing when an invalid token is passed in.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- Occasional crashes when joining a channel on macOS.
- When calling the `playEffect` method to play two audio files using the same `soundId`, the first audio file was sometimes played repeatedly.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableContentInspectEx`
- `contentInspectImageModeration` in `ContentInspectType`
- `serverConfig` in `ContentInspectConfig`
- The following enumerations in `onLocalVideoStateChanged`:

  - `LocalVideoStreamErrorScreenCapturePaused`
  - `LocalVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureResumed`
  - `LocalVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureWindowHidden`
  - `LocalVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureWindowRecoverFromHidden`
  - `LocalVideoStreamErrorScreenCaptureWindowRecoverFromMinimized`

- `d3d11_texture_2d` and `texture_slice_index` in `ExternalVideoFrame`

- `VideoTextureId3d11texture2d` in `VideoPixelFormat`
- `isFeatureAvailableOnDevice`
- `FeatureType`

### v4.2.1

This version was released on June 21, 2023.

#### Improvements

This version improves the network transmission strategy, enhancing the smoothness of audio interactions.

#### Issues fixed

This version fixed the following issues:

- Inability to join channels caused by SDK's incompatibility with some older versions of AccessToken.
- After the sending end called `setAINSMode` to activate AI noise reduction, occasional echo was observed by the receiving end.
- Brief noise occurred while playing media files using the media player.


### v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May 29, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**2. Virtual sound card (macOS)**

As of v4.2.0, Agora supports third-party virtual sound cards. You can use a third-party virtual sound card as the audio input or output device for the SDK. You can use the `stateChanged` callback to see whether the current input or output device selected by the SDK is a virtual sound card.

<div class="alert note">If you set AgoraALD or Soundflower as the default input or output device when joining a channel, you will not hear audio.</div>

**3. Miscellaneous**

- `onApiCallExecuted` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- The `IAudioFrameObserver` class is renamed to `IAudioPcmFrameSink`, thus the prototypes of the following methods are updated accordingly:
  - `onFrame`
  - `registerAudioFrameObserver` and `unregisterAudioFrameObserver` in `IMediaPlayer`
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**AI Noise Suppression**

This release introduces public APIs for the AI Noise Suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise reduction mode as balance, aggressive, or low latency according to your scenarios.

<div class="alert note">Agora charges separately for this function. See [AI Noise Suppression unit pricing](pricing#ai-noise-suppression-pricing).</div>

#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannleMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannleMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**3. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:
- When the host frequently switched the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members could not hear the audio of the host.
- The receiver was receiving the low-quality stream originally and automatically switched to the high-quality stream after a few seconds (macOS).
- Incorrect information in the type field of the return value after calling `getDefaultAudioDevice` (macOS).
- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `getNtpWallTimeInMs`
- `getCurrentMonotonicTimeInMs`
- `setAINSMode`
- `createAudioCustomTrack`
- `destroyAudioCustomTrack`
- `AudioTrackConfig`
- `AudioAinsMode`
- `AudioTrackType`
- The `domainLimit` and `autoRegisterAgoraExtensions` members in `RtcEngineContext`

**Deprecated**

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `startChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `onChannelMediaRelayEvent`
- `ChannelMediaRelayEvent`

**Deleted**

- `onApiCallExecuted`
- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `ChannelMediaOptions`


### v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December 20, 2022.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call `setInEarMonitoringVolume`.

**2. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the
`getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use. The available values
 are `UNKNOWN`, `DISCONNECTED`, `LAN`, `WIFI`, `2G`, `3G`, `4G`, and `5G`. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `onNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report the current network connection type.

**3. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports the three audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Agora also supports publishers in choosing whether the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered bypass this filter mechanism and are transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios with a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reduce the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

<div class="alert info">To enable this function, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io/">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

**4. Loopback device (Windows)**

The SDK uses the playback device as the loopback device by default. As of 4.1.0, you can specify a loopback device separately and publish the captured audio to the remote end.

- `setLoopbackDevice`: Specifies the loopback device. If you do not want the current playback device to be the loopback device, you can call this method to specify another device as the loopback device.
- `getLoopbackDevice`: Gets the current loopback device.
- `followSystemLoopbackDevice`: Whether the loopback device follows the default playback device of the system.

**5. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense-of-presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listener experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation` respectively, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation parameter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`. The receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the audio experience for users with headphones.  If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.

**6. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.


**7. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

<div class="alert info">To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

**8. Register extensions (Windows)**

This release adds the `registerExtension` method for registering extensions. When using a third-party extension, you need to call the extension-related APIs in the following order:

`loadExtensionProvider` -> `registerExtension` -> `setExtensionProviderProperty` -> `enableExtension`

**9. Device management**

This release adds a series of callbacks to help you better understand the status of your audio devices:

- `onAudioDeviceStateChanged`: Occurs when the status of the audio device changes.
- `onAudioDeviceVolumeChanged`: Occurs when the volume of an audio device or app changes.

**10. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel-related methods that you can call to manage audio in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` method is used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio stream.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` is used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `options` parameter in the `leaveChannelEx` method is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.


#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `RelayEventPacketUpdateDestChannelRefused (8)`, and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `audioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixes the following issues:

**All**

The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.

**macOS**

After starting and stopping the audio capture device test, there was no sound when the audio playback device was subsequently started.

### v<Vg k = "VSDK_LATEST_4_0_0"/>

v<Vg k = "VSDK_LATEST_4_0_0"/> was released on September 29, 2022.

#### Compatibility changes

**Integration change**

This release has changed the SDK package name from `electron-agora-rtc-ng` to `agora-electron-sdk`, and optimized the implementation of some features, resulting in incompatibility with v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/>. The following are the main features with compatibility changes:

- Multiple channel
- Media stream publishing control
- Warning codes

After upgrading the SDK, you need to update the code in your app according to your business scenarios. For details, see [Migration guide](../overview/migration-guide).


#### New features

**1. Multiple media tracks**

This release supports one `IRtcEngine` instance to collect multiple audio and video sources at the same time and publish them to the remote users by setting `RtcEngineEx` and `ChannelMediaOptions.`

- After calling `joinChannel` to join the first channel, call `joinChannelEx` multiple times to join multiple channels, and publish the specified stream to different channels through different user ID (`localUid`) and `ChannelMediaOptions` settings.
- You can simultaneously publish multiple sets of video streams captured by multiple cameras or screen sharing by setting `publishSecondaryCameraTrack` and `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions`. 

This release adds `createCustomVideoTrack` method to implement video custom capture. You can refer to the following steps to publish multiple custom captured video in the channel:

    1. Create a custom video track: Call this method to create a video track, and get the video track ID.
    2. Set the custom video track to be published in the channel: In each channel's `ChannelMediaOptions`, set the `customVideoTrackId` parameter to the ID of the video track you want to publish, and set `publishCustomVideoTrack` to `true`.
    3. Pushing an external video source: Call `pushVideoFrame`, and specify `videoTrackId` as the ID of the custom video track in step 2 in order to publish the corresponding custom video source in multiple channels.

You can also experience the following features with the multi-channel capability:

    * Publish multiple sets of audio and video streams to the remote users through different user IDs (`uid`).
    * Mix multiple audio streams and publish to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).
    * Combine multiple video streams and publish them to the remote users through a user ID (`uid`).

**2. Ultra HD resolution (Beta)**

    In order to improve the interactive video experience, the SDK optimizes the whole process of video capture, encoding, decoding and rendering, and now supports 4K resolution. The improved FEC (Forward Error Correction) algorithm enables adaptive switches according to the frame rate and number of video frame packets, which further reduces the video stuttering rate in 4K scenes. Additionally, you can set the encoding resolution to 4K (3840 × 2160) and the frame rate to 60 fps when calling `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The SDK supports automatic fallback to the appropriate resolution and frame rate if your device does not support 4K.

> **_NOTE:_** This feature has certain requirements with regards to device performance and network bandwidth, and the supported upstream and downstream frame rates vary on different platforms. To experience this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">technical support</a>.

**3. Agora media player**

To make it easier for users to integrate the Agora SDK and reduce the SDK's package size, this release introduces the Agora media player. After calling the `createMediaPlayer` method to create a media player object, you can then call the methods in the `IMediaPlayer` class to experience a series of functions, such as playing local and online media files, preloading a media file, changing the CDN route for playing according to your network conditions, or sharing the audio and video streams being played with remote users.

- Plays local and online media files.
- Preloads media files.
- Changes the CDN route for playing media files according your network conditions.
- Shares the audio and video streams being played with remote users.
- Caches data when playing media files.

**3.Brand-new AI Noise Suppression**

The SDK supports a new version of AI noise reduction (in comparison to the basic AI noise reduction in v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/>). The new AI noise reduction has better vocal fidelity, cleaner noise suppression, and adds a dereverberation option. 
> **_NOTE:_** To experience this feature, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io ">support@agora.io</a>.

**5. Ultra-high audio quality**

To make the audio clearer and restore more details, this release adds the `UltraHighQualityVoice` enumeration. In scenarios that mainly feature the human voice, such as chat or singing, you can call `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` and use this enumeration to experience ultra-high audio quality.

**6. Real-time chorus**

This release gives real-time chorus the following abilities:

- Two or more choruses are supported.
- Each singer is independent of each other. If one singer fails or quits the chorus, the other singers can continue to sing.
- Very low latency experience. Each singer can hear each other in real time, and the audience can also hear each singer in real time.

This release adds the `AudioScenarioChorus` enumeration in `AudioScenarioType`. With this enumeration, users can experience ultra-low latency in real-time chorus when the network conditions are good.


**7. Enhanced channel management**

To meet the channel management requirements of various business scenarios, this release adds the following functions to the `ChannelMediaOptions` structure:

- Sets or switches the publishing of multiple audio and video sources.
- Sets or switches channel profile and user role.
- Sets or switches the stream type of the subscribed video.
- Controls audio publishing delay.

Set `ChannelMediaOptions` when calling `joinChannel` or `joinChannelEx` to specify the publishing and subscription behavior of a media stream, for example, whether to publish video streams captured by cameras or screen sharing, and whether to subscribe to the audio and video streams of remote users. After joining the channel, call `updateChannelMediaOptions` to update the settings in `ChannelMediaOptions` at any time, for example, to switch the published audio and video sources.

**8. Screen sharing**

This release optimizes the screen sharing function. You can enable this function in the following ways.

- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method before joining a channel, and then call `JoinChannel` [2/2] to join a channel and set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as true.
- Call the `StartScreenCaptureByDisplayId` method after joining a channel, and then call `UpdateChannelMediaOptions` to set `publishScreenTrack` or `publishSecondaryScreenTrack` as true.

**9. Subscription allowlists and blocklists**

This release introduces subscription allowlists and blocklists for remote audio and video streams. You can add a user ID that you want to subscribe to in your allowlist, or add a user ID for the streams you do not wish to see to your blocklists. You can experience this feature through the following APIs, and in scenarios that involve multiple channels, you can call the following methods in the `IRtcEngineEx` interface:

- `SetSubscribeAudioBlocklist`：Set the audio subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeAudioAllowlist`：Set the audio subscription allowlist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoBlocklist`：Set the video subscription blocklist.
- `SetSubscribeVideoAllowlist`：Set the video subscription allowlist.

If a user is added in a blocklist and a allowlist at the same time, only the blocklist takes effect.

**10. Set audio scenarios**

To make it easier to change audio scenarios, this release adds the `SetAudioScenario` method. For example, if you want to change the audio scenario from `AudioScenarioDefault` to `AudioScenarioGameStreaming` when you are in a channel, you can call this method.

**11. Replace video feeds with images**

This release supports replacing video feeds with images when publishing video streams. You can call the `enableVideoImageSource` method to enable this function and choose your own images through the `options` parameter.  If you disable this function, the remote users see the video feeds that you publish.

**12. Local video mixing**

This release adds a series of APIs supporting local video mixing functions. You can mix multiple video streams into one video stream locally. Common scenarios are as follows:

- In interactive live streaming scenarios with cohosts or when using the Media Push function, you can merge the screens of multiple hosts into one view locally.
- In scenarios where you capture multiple local video streams (for example, video captured by cameras, screen sharing streams, video files or pictures), you can and merge them into one video stream and then publish the mixed video stream in the channel.

You can call the `startLocalVideoTranscoder` method to start local video mixing and call the `stopLocalVideoTranscoder` method to stop local video mixing. After the local video mixing starts, you can call `updateLocalTranscoderConfiguration` to update the local video mixing configuration.

**13. Video device management**

Video capture devices can support multiple video formats, each supporting a different combination of video frame width, video frame height, and frame rate.

This release adds the `numberOfCapabilities` and `getCapability` methods for getting the number of video formats supported by the video capture device and the details of the video frames in the specified video format. When calling the `startPrimaryCameraCapture` or `startSecondaryCameraCapture` method to capture video using the camera, you can use the specified video format.
> **_NOTE:_** The SDK automatically selects the best video format for the video capture device based on your settings in <code>VideoEncoderConfiguration</code>, so normally you should not need to use these new methods.

#### Improvements

**1. Fast channel switching**

This release can achieve the same switching speed as `SwitchChannel` in v<Vg k = "VSDK_PREVIOUS_RELEASE"/> through the `LeaveChannel` and `JoinChannel `methods so that you don't need to take the time to call the `SwitchChannel `method.

**2. Push external video frames**

This releases supports pushing video frames in I422 format. You can call the `pushVideoFrame`[1/2] method to push such video frames to the SDK.

**3. Voice pitch of the local user**
This release adds `voicePitch` in `AudioVolumeInfo` of `onAudioVolumeIndication`. You can use `voicePitch` to get the local user's voice pitch and perform business functions such as rating for singing.

**4. Video preview**

This release improves the implementation logic of `startPreview`. You can call the `startPreview `method to enable video preview at any time.

**5. Video types of subscription**

You can call the `setRemoteDefaultVideoStreamType` method to choose the video stream type when subscribing to streams.
