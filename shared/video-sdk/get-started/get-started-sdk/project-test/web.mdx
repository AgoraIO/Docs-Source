Take the following steps to test the sample code:

1. Update the `scripts` and `dependencies` in `package.json` as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "agora_web_quickstart",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "basicEngagement.js",
        "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
            "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
            "start:dev": "webpack serve --open --config webpack.config.js"
        },
        "dependencies": {
            "agora-rtc-sdk-ng": "latest",
            "webpack": "5.28.0",
            "webpack-dev-server": "3.11.2",
            "webpack-cli": "4.10.0"
        },
        "author": "",
        "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

1. To configure webpack, create a file named `webpack.config.js` in the project folder and copy the following code to the file:

    ```js
    const path = require("path");

    module.exports = {
        entry: "./basicEngagement.js",
        output: {
            filename: "bundle.js",
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./dist"),
        },
        devServer: {
            compress: true,
            port: 9000,
        },
    };
    ```

1. To install the dependencies, execute the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1. To compile the project with webpack, use the following command :
    
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

1. Run the project using the webpack-dev-server:

    ```shell
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    Your browser automatically opens the following page:

    <ProductWrapper product='video-calling'>
    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-ui-web.png)
    </ProductWrapper>
    <ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>
    ![](/images/video-sdk/quickstart-ui-web-ils.png)
    </ProductWrapper>

1. Observe the following results:

    <ProductWrapper product='video-calling'>
    1. Click **JOIN** to join the channel. 
    1. Invite a friend to clone this sample project. 
    1. Open the file `src/index.html` in a browser, and enter the same App ID, channel name, and temporary token. 
    
        Once your friend joins the channel, you can see and hear each other.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product='interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming'>
    1. Click **Join as host** to join the channel as a host. 
    1. Invite a friend to clone this sample project. 
    1. Open the file `src/index.html` in a browser, and enter the same App ID, channel name, and temporary token. 
        
        If your friend joins the channel as a host, you can see each other and hear each other. If your friend joins as audience, they can see your video and hear your audio.
