### Implement online user status tracking

This section provides sample Java code to show how to use channel event callbacks to maintain online user status at your app server.

To maintain a user registry, take the following steps:

1. Create a new file in you JAVA project folder named `UserRegistry.java` containing the following code.

    ```java
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Timer;
    import java.util.TimerTask;

    public class UserRegistry {
        public static int EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN = 103;
        public static int EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT = 104;
        public static int EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN = 105;
        public static int EVENT_AUDIENCE_QUIT = 106;
        public static int EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER = 111;
        public static int EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE = 112;
        
        public static int ROLE_BROADCASTER = 1;
        public static int ROLE_AUDIENCE = 2;
        public static int WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS = 60 * 1000;
        private static Timer timer = new Timer();

        class User { // Holds user information
            int uid; // user ID
            int role; // user role
            boolean isOnline; // whether the user is in a channel
            long lastClientSeq; // clientSeq of the last event handled by your server

            public User(int uid, int role, boolean isOnline, long clientSeq) {
                this.uid = uid;
                this.role = role;
                this.isOnline = isOnline;
                this.lastClientSeq = clientSeq;
            }
        };

        // Channel list
        private static HashMap<String, Channel> channels = new HashMap<>();;

        class Channel { // Holds the list of users in each channel
            HashMap<Integer, User> users = new HashMap<>();
        };

        // Process Agora Notifications  callbacks to update user registry
        public void HandleNcsEvent(String channelName, int uid, int eventType, long clientSeq) {
            // Check the eventType to process events that notify of users joining or
            // leaving a channel or a change in the user role
            if (eventType != EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN &&
                eventType != EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT &&
                eventType != EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN &&
                eventType != EVENT_AUDIENCE_QUIT &&
                eventType != EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER &&
                eventType != EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE) {
                
                return;
            }

            // Determine whether a user is online
            boolean isOnlineInNotice = IsUserOnlineInNotice(eventType);
            // Get the user role from eventType
            int roleInNotice = GetUserRoleInNotice(eventType);

            Channel channel = channels.get(channelName);
            if (channel == null) {
                // If a channel does not exist, create a channel and add it to the list
                channel = new Channel();
                channels.put(channelName, channel);
                System.out.println("New channel " + channelName + " created");
            }

            User user = channel.users.get(uid);
            // Get whether a user has left a channel
            boolean isQuit = !isOnlineInNotice && (user == null || user.isOnline);
            if (user == null) {
                // Create a new user and add it to the user list of the corresponding channel
                user = new User(uid, roleInNotice, isOnlineInNotice, clientSeq);
                channel.users.put(uid, user);

                if (isOnlineInNotice) {
                    System.out.println("New User " + uid + " joined channel " + channelName);
                } else {
                    // Set a timer for deleting a user's data after the user leaves a channel
                    DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(channelName, uid, clientSeq);
                }
            } else if (clientSeq > user.lastClientSeq) {
                /*
                * If the data for a user already exists, compare the clientSeq
                * of the latest notification with that of the last notification
                * callback handled by your server. If the latest value is greater,
                * update the user data; otherwise, ignore the notification callback.
                */
                user.role = roleInNotice;
                user.isOnline = isOnlineInNotice;
                user.lastClientSeq = clientSeq;

                if (isQuit) {
                    // Mark the status of a user as offline, and delete the user after one minute
                    System.out.println("User " + uid + " quit channel " + channelName);
                    DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(channelName, uid, clientSeq);
                }
            }
        }

        // Set a timer for deleting the data of an offline user
        private void DelayedRemoveUserFromChannel(final String channelName, final int uid, final long clientSeq) {
            timer.schedule(new TimerTask() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    Channel channel = channels.get(channelName);
                    if (channel == null) return;
                    User user = channel.users.get(uid);
                    if (user == null) return;

                    // If the value in the clientSeq field changes, do not delete data
                    if (user.lastClientSeq != clientSeq) return;

                    if (!user.isOnline) {
                        // Delete user data only when the user is offline
                        channel.users.remove(uid);
                        System.out.println("Removed user " + uid + " from channel " + channelName);
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("User " + uid + " is online while delayed removing, cancelled");
                    }

                    // If there are no users left in the channel, delete the channel
                    if (channel.users.isEmpty()) {
                        channels.remove(channelName);
                        System.out.println("Removed channel " + channelName);
                    }
                }
            }, WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS);
        }

        // Determine whether a user is online.
        private static boolean IsUserOnlineInNotice(int eventType) {
            return eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_AUDIENCE_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_AUDIENCE;
        }

        // Get the user role.
        private static int GetUserRoleInNotice(int eventType) {
            if (eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_JOIN ||
                eventType == EVENT_BROADCASTER_QUIT ||
                eventType == EVENT_CHANGE_ROLE_TO_BROADCASTER) {
            return ROLE_BROADCASTER;
            } else {
                return ROLE_AUDIENCE;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Instantiate the `UserRegistry` class

    Add the following code to the `Handlers` class after `public class Handlers ` :

    ```java
      public static UserRegistry userRegistry = new UserRegistry();
    ```


1. To update the user registry when you receive a <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> callback, add the following code to the `handle` method in the `NcsHandler` class after `os.close();`:

    ```java
    // Maintain user registry
    userRegistry.HandleNcsEvent(channelName, uid, eventType, clientSeq);
    ```

When adopting the solutions recommended by <Vg k="COMPANY" /> to maintain user online status, you need to recognize the following:

* The solutions only guarantee eventual consistency of user status.
* To improve accuracy, notification callbacks specific to one channel must be handled in a single process.
