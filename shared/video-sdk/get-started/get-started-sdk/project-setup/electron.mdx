Create a new folder for your Electron project. Add the following files to the project root folder:

* `package.json`: Used to install and manage project dependencies.
* `index.html`: Specifies the user interface of the app.
* `main.js`: The main process file.
* `renderer.js`: Rendering process file, used to interact with <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

        1. Add the following code to `package.json`:

            * macOS

                ```json
                {
                    "name": "electron-demo-app",
                    "version": "0.1.0",
                    "author": "your name",
                    "description": "My Electron app",
                    "main": "main.js",
                    "scripts": {
                        "start": "electron ."
                    },
                    "agora_electron": {
                        "platform": "darwin",
                        "prebuilt": true
                    },
                    "dependencies": { "agora-electron-sdk": "latest" },
                    "devDependencies": {"electron": "latest" }
                }
                ```
            
            * Windows

                ```json
                {
                    "name": "electron-demo-app",
                    "version": "0.1.0",
                    "author": "your name",
                    "description": "My Electron app",
                    "main": "main.js",
                    "scripts": {
                        "start": "electron ."
                    },
                    "agora_electron": {
                        "platform": "win32",
                        "prebuilt": true,
                        "arch": "ia32"
                    },
                    "dependencies": { "agora-electron-sdk": "latest" },
                    "devDependencies": {"electron": "latest" }
                }
                ```

            The specific meaning of the fields is as follows:

            * `agora-electron-sdk`: The version number of Agora Electron SDK. Set to `latest` means getting the latest version of the SDK. Other versions can be viewed in agora-electron-sdk.
            * `electron`: Electron version number, supports version 5.0.0 and above (including the latest version). If you use a macOS device equipped with an M1 chip, the Electron version number needs to be set to 11.0.0 or above.
            * `platform`: (Optional) The default is selected according to the system, macOS is darwin, Windows is win32.
            * `prebuilt`: (Optional) The default setting trueis to prevent the incompatibility between the Electron or Node.js version and the SDK.
            * `arch`: (Optional) Selected by system by default.

            <Admonition title="Note" style="info">Different versions of Electron have different environment requirements. If you see errors due to a mismatched environment when running the project, refer to the official Electron documentation to choose the appropriate Electron and Node.js versions.</Admonition>

        1. Open Terminal in the project root directory and run the following commands to install the dependencies:

            ```bash
            // macOS
            npm install

            // Windows
            npm install -D --arch=ia32 electron
            npm install
            ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab2" label="Manual integration">
    In addition to using npm integration, you can also enter Electron-SDK to manually compile the latest SDK and integrate it into the application.

  </TabItem>
