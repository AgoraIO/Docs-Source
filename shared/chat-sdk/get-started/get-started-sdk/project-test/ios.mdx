<div class="alert note">You can log in to the app by either entering the required fields in the user interface as stated below, or modifying the fields in the <a href="#sign-in"><code>ViewController.swift</code></a> file.</div>

To validate the peer-to-peer messaging you have just integrated into your app using Agora Chat, perform the following operations:

1. Log in  
On your simulator or physical device, enter the user ID (`lxm`) and Agora token of the sender in the **User Id** and **Token** box respectively, and click **Login**.

2. Send a message  
Fill in the user ID of the receiver (`lxm2`) in the **Remote User Id** box, type in the message ("Hello") to send in the **Input text message** box, and click **Send**.

3. Log out  
Click **Logout** to log out of the sender account.

4. Receive the message  
After signing out, log in with the user ID and Agora token of the receiver (`lxm2`) and receive the message "Hello" sent in step 2.
