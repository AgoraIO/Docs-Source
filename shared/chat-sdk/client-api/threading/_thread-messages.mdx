Threads enable users to create a separate conversation from a specific message within a chat group to keep the main chat uncluttered.

This page shows how to use the Chat SDK to send, receive, recall, and retrieve thread messages in your app.

## Understand the tech

<Understand />

- Send a thread message
- Receive a thread message
- Recall a thread message
- Retrieve thread messages

The following figure shows the workflow of how clients send and receive peer-to-peer messages.

![Thread Messages](/images/chat/thread-messages.png)

As shown in the figure, the workflow of peer-to-peer messaging is as follows:

1. Clients retrieve a token from your app server.
2. Client A and Client B log in to Chat.
3. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to the Chat server and the server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives the message, the SDK triggers an event. Client B listens for the event and gets the message.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have initialized the Chat SDK. For details, see <Link to="/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link>.
- You understand the call frequency limit of the Chat APIs supported by different pricing plans as described in [Limitations](/agora-chat/reference/limitations).

<div class="alert info">The thread feature is supported by all types of [Pricing Plans](/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details) and is enabled by default once you have enabled Chat in <a href="https://console.agora.io/">Agora Console</a>.</div>


## Implementation

This section describes how to call the APIs provided by the Chat SDK to implement thread features.
