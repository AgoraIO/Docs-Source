## Add the required dependencies

In the project’s `go.mod` or builds file, add the following lines to include the required SDK dependencies.

```bash
# Replace /path/to/go_rtc_sdk with the actual path of the SDK you downloaded in Step 1
replace github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 => /path/to/go_rtc_sdk
# Replace version_number with the actual SDK version number, which you can find in the release notes, e.g., v2.1.0
require github.com/AgoraIO-Extensions/Agora-Golang-Server-SDK/v2 version_number
```
