## Sample project

The complete <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_MARKETPLACE_BASE_URL}}/FaceUnity/android">Android <Vg k="RTEE_FU"/> sample project</Link> is available on GitHub.

#### Run the sample project

Take the following steps to set up and run the sample project:

1. To clone the Github repository, execute the following command in a terminal window:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/AgoraMarketPlace.git
    ```

1. Visit the [<Vg k="RTEE_FU" /> extension page](https://console.agora.io/marketplace/extension/introduce?serviceName=faceunity-ar-en), click **Contact Us**, and fill in the details to obtain an exclusive certificate file from <Vg k="COMPANY" />. 

    Your certificate is bound to the package name you provide. You can find and modify the package name under `applicationId` in the `build.gradle` file of the project. For example, `io.agora.rte.extension.faceunity`. You receive the `authpack.java` certificate file that corresponds to your package name. Copy the file to the path corresponding to the package name. For example, `app/src/main/java/io/agora/rte/extension/faceunity/example/`.

1. Download the [FaceUnity resource package](https://download.agora.io/marketplace/release/FaceUnity_v8.4.1_Resources.zip). Unzip the package and save all files in the `FaceUnity/android/app/src/main/assets/` folder.

1. From the Extensions Marketplace download the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}/marketplace/extension/introduce?serviceName=faceunity-ar-en"> FaceUnity AR Filter</Link> package for Android. Unzip the package, and save the `.aar` files to the `FaceUnity/android/app/libs` folder.

1. Open the `AgoraMarketplace/FaceUnity/android` project from the downloaded repository in Android Studio. 

1. Open the `FaceUnity/android/app/src/main/java/io/Agora/rte/extension/FaceUnity/example/Config.java` file, and replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>` with your App ID and the `mToken` value with a valid token. To get an App ID, see [Getting Started with Agora](../../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id).


   ``` java
   package io.agora.rte.extension.faceunity.example;

   public interface Config {
       String mAppId = "<YOUR_APP_ID>";
       String mToken = null;
   }
   ```

1. Sync the Android project files with Gradle.

1. Connect an Android device (not an emulator) and run the project.
