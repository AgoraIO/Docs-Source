There are no methods available in the react-native SDK to generate authentication tokens. An easy workaround for this is to implement a token generator using `Node.js` libraries and host it on a server. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> can make an HTTP get request to this server and fetch the token.

This section will show you how to implement a token generator using Node.js.
