This section shows how to implement managing messages.

### Retrieve conversations

Call `LoadAllConversations` to retrieve all the conversations on the local device:

```csharp
List<Conversation>list = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.LoadAllConversations();
```

### Retrieve messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code sample to retrieve the messages in the specified conversation:

```csharp
// Get the specified conversation on the local device.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
// Call LoadMessages to retrieve messages by specifying the `startMsgId` and `pageSize`.
conv.LoadMessages(startMsgId, pagesize, callback:new ValueCallBack<List<Message>>(
  onSuccess: (list) => {
     Debug.Log($"{list.Count} Messages retrieved.");
  },
  onError:(code, desc) => {
     Debug.Log($"Fails to retrieve the message, errCode={code}, errDesc={desc}");
  }
));
```

### Retrieve the count of unread messages in the specified conversation

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of unread messages:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
int unread = conv.UnReadCount;
```

### Retrieve the count of unread messages in all conversations

Refer to the following code example to retrieve the count of all unread messages:

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetUnreadMessageCount();
```

### Mark unread messages as read

Refer to the following code example to mark the specified messages as read:

```csharp
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
// Mark all the messages in the current conversation as read.
conv.MarkAllMessageAsRead();
// Mark the specified message as read.
conv.MarkMessageAsRead(msgId);
// Mark all unread messages as read.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.MarkAllConversationsAsRead();
```

### Delete conversations and historical messages

You can delete conversations on both the local device and the server.

To delete them on the local device, call `DeleteConversation` and `DeleteMessage`:

```csharp
// Call DeleteConversation to delete the specified conversation. 
// `true` indicates to keep the historical messages while deleting the conversation. To remove the historical messages as well, set it as `false`.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversation(conversationId, true);
// Delete the specified message in the current conversaiton.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
conv.DeleteMessage(msgId);
```

To delete conversations on the server, call `DeleteConversationFromServer`:

```csharp
// Delete a conversation on the server. If you want to keep the historical messages, pass “false” to the third parameter.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.DeleteConversationFromServer(conversationId, type, true, new CallBack(
    onSuccess: () => {
    },
    onError: (code, desc) => {
    }
));
```

### Delete all messages in a local conversation

You can call `DeleteAllMessages` to delete all messages sent and received in a local conversation:

```csharp
// conversationId: The conversation ID, which is the user ID of the peer user in one-to-one chat, group ID in group chat, and chat room ID in room chat.
// conversationType: The conversation type, which is `Chat` for one-to-one chat, `Group` for group chat, and `Room` for room chat.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversionId, conversationType);

if (conv.DeleteAllMessages()){
    //Succeeded in deleting messages
}
else{
    //Failed to delete messages
}
```

### Delete messages in a local conversation by time period

You can call `DeleteMessages` to delete messages sent and received in a certain period in a local conversation.

```csharp
// conversationId: The conversation ID, which is the user ID of the peer user in one-to-one chat, group ID in group chat, and chat room ID in room chat.
// conversationType: The conversation type, which is `Chat` for one-to-one chat, `Group` for group chat, and `Room` for room chat.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversionId, conversationType);

if (conv.DeleteMessages(startTime, endTime)) {
    //Succeeded in deleting messages
}
else {
    //Failed to delete messages
}
```

### Search for messages using keywords

Call `SearchMsgFromDB` to search for messages by keywords, timestamp, and message sender:

```csharp
List<Message> list = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.SearchMsgFromDB(keywords, timeStamp, maxCount, from, MessageSearchDirection.UP);
```

### Import messages

Call `ImportMessages` to import multiple messages to the specified conversation.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.ImportMessages(messages, new CallBack(
  onSuccess: () => {
  },
  onError: (code, desc) =>
  {
  }
));
```

### Insert messages

If you want to insert a message to the current conversation without actually sending the message, construct the message body and call `InsertMessage`. This can be used to send notification messages such as "XXX recalls a message", "XXX joins the chat group", and "Typing ...".

```csharp
// Insert the message to the current conversation.
Conversation conv = SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetConversation(conversationId, convType);
conv.InsertMessage(message);
```
