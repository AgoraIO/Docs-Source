App developers spent a lot of time selecting, integrating, and testing different combinations of SDKs in order to ensure call quality and effects. Every step slowed down the process of app delivery. Now, the Extensions Marketplace does all the heavy lifting for you! It helps developers shorten the integration time and enables them to concentrate on business logic and user experience.

The Extensions Marketplace increases your productivity and your revenue. Kick back and relax, Agora enables you to make more money with less work. 

## Understand extensions

Extensions are packages that you load into your app using Agora SDKs. They access the media transmission pipeline in the SDK and modify how audio or video data is processed in the pipeline.

Agora provides the following for you to work with extensions:

- [Extensions Marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/): The virtual marketplace for you to discover extensions that you can add to your app.
- Extension APIs: A set of APIs provided by the Agora SDK that you call to enable and configure the features of an extension.

## Platform support
The Agora Extensions Marketplace provides support for multiple platforms. An extension is used together with the Agora SDK corresponding to the platform. See the table below:

| Platform                                         | Required SDK           | Required SDK version          | SDK advantages                                            |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows | Agora SDK v4.0.0 Beta | v4.0.0-beta.1 and later | See [SDK v4.0.0 Beta Benefits and Features](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-call-4.x-beta/product_video_ng?platform=Android) |

## Work with extensions

The workflow of using an extension from the Extensions Marketplace is as follows:

1. [Activate an extension](./get_extension) in Agora Console.
2. Implement the extension in your app
   Each extension has its own implementation guides. Implementation guides are provided by the vendor, validated by Agora, and published with the extension on Agora Console.

## Advantages

Using extensions from the Agora Extensions Marketplace has a number of advantages.

### Easier and faster integration

Extensions provide an easy and fast way to add fun features into your app. Instead of writing lines of code on your own, you just need to call several APIs.

### Unlimited extensibility

There is no upper limit on the number of extensions you can add into Agora SDKs. You can extend and customize the functionality of Agora SDKs as much as you want.

### Consistent experience

Agora Console provides a consistent way for you to manage different extensions. All the information you need is presented in the detail page of the extension. You do not have to jump from one website to another.

## Pricing

The pricing plan is proposed by extension vendors and varies according to extensions. You can see the pricing details when activating the extension on Agora Console.
