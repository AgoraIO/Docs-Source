This document tracks important changes and improvements to the <Vpd k="NAME" />. 

## Releases

### 2025.10.1

Released on October 1, 2025.

This is the first release of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME" />, a cloud-based service that transcodes, mixes, and composites real-time audio and video streams on the server side before publishing them back to RTC channels.

#### Main features

- **Low energy consumption for client devices**  
Offload stream processing to the server before publishing to the RTC channel. This reduces CPU/GPU load on audience devices, especially those with limited performance.

- **Low bitrate streaming for poor network conditions**  
Improve video fluency and reliability under weak downlink conditions by mixing audio, combining images, and transcoding into low-bitrate streams. Ideal for audiences subscribing to multiple hosts or single HD streams.

- **Cross-platform compatibility**  
Support for standard H.264 and VP8 encoding ensures consistent playback across platforms. Host source streams from Native platforms can be converted to VP8 for optimized Web viewing.

- **Automated stream processing workflow**  
Automatically subscribe to specified user streams in RTC channels based on UID configuration. The service handles transcoding, audio mixing, and video compositing, then republishes processed streams back to the channel.

- **Reduced bandwidth and simplified integration**  
Viewers no longer need to subscribe to multiple host streams individually. This reduces downstream bandwidth usage and lowers development complexity with fewer API calls and streamlined workflows.
