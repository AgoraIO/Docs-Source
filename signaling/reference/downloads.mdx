To manually install <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />:

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">


## Through the Agora website

1. Download the Agora RTM Web SDK from https://download.agora.io/rtmsdk/release/Agora_RTM_SDK_for_Web_v1.5.0.zip. In the SDK folder, find the JS file in the libs folder, and save it to your project directory.

1. Open the HTML file in your project directory, and add the following code to refer to the JS file:

    ```javascript
    <script src="path to the JS file"></script>
    ```
1. (Optional) To enable smart completions and type checking, take the following steps:

1. Go to `libs/agora-rtm-sdk.d.ts` in the SDK folder, and save the TS file to your project directory.

1. Add the following line to the beginning of the JS or TS file (you should replace path to the TS file with the path to agora-rtm-sdk.d.ts).

    ```javascript
    /// <reference path="path to the TS file" />
    ```

## Through npm

1. In `package.json`, add agora-rtm-sdk and its version number to the dependencies field:
    ```javascript
    {
        "name": "web",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "index.js",
        "scripts": {
        "test": "echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1"
    },
        "dependencies": {
        "agora-rtm-sdk": "latest"
    },
        "author": "",
        "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

1. Import the AgoraRTM module in the JS or TS file:
1. import AgoraRTM from 'agora-rtm-sdk'

</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="android">


## Automatically integrate the SDK with JitPack

1. Add the address of Jitpack in the build.gradle file under the root directory of your project.

    ```
    allprojects {
            repositories {
                ...
                maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
            }
        }
    ```

1. Add the com.github.agorabuilder:rtm-sdk dependency in the /app/build.gradle file under your project (for X.Y.Z, please fill in the current SDK version number). You can visit JitPack.io to see the latest version number.
    ```
    dependencies: {
        ...
        implementation 'com.github.agorabuilder:rtm-sdk:X.Y.Z'
    }
    ```

##  Manually copy the SDK files

To manually install <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> from a download:

1. Extract the files from: https://download.agora.io/rtmsdk/release/Agora_RTM_SDK_for_Android_v1_5_0.zip to a local directory, `<unzipped_package>`.

2. Copy the following file or subfolder from the libs folder of the downloaded SDK to the corresponding directory of your project.:

    | File or folder           | Path in your project     |
    |--------------------------|--------------------------|
    | Files                    |                          |
    | `agora-rtm_sdk.jar`      | `/app/libs/`             |
    | `/arm64-v8a/libagora-rtm-sdk-jni.so` | `~/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/ |
    | `/armeabi-v7a/libagora-rtm-sdk-jni.so` | `~/app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/ |
    | `/x86/libagora-rtm-jni.so` | `~/app/src/main/jniLibs/x86/ |
    | `/x86_64/libagora-rtm-sdk-jni.so` | `~/app/src/main/jniLibs/x86_64/ |

## Automatically integrate the SDK with CocoaPods

To manually install <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />:

1. [Ensure that you have installed **CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2.  In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3.  Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes.

    ``` bash
    target 'Your App' do
        use_frameworks!
        pod 'AgoraRtm_iOS'
    end
    ```
1. Replace `Your App` with the target name of your project.

1. Go back to Terminal, and run the pod update command to update the local libraries.

4.  Run the `pod install` command to install <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5.  Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

## Manually add the SDK files

v1.4.4 or later :

The iOS apps integrated with the RTM SDK v1.4.4 cannot be published on the App Store due to review issues. If you want to publish your app on the App Store, you must use other versions of the SDK.

1. Download https://download.agora.io/rtmsdk/release/Agora_RTM_SDK_for_iOS_v1_5_0.zip, and extract the files.
1. Copy `AgoraRtmKit.xcframework` from the SDK to your project.
1. Open Xcode, and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.
1. Click **+ > Add Other… > Add Files** to add the corresponding library. Ensure that the Embed attribute of the dynamic library is **Embed & Sign**.
Once the dynamic library is added, the project automatically links to other system libraries.

The SDK uses the XCFramework. **If you are using a build tool that does not support XCFramework integration**, Agora provides the following scripts to help you integrate:

- Use the change_to_all_arch.sh script to convert the XCFramework to the universal framework.
- If you need to publish an iOS app on the App Store, use the remove_simulator_arch.sh script to remove the simulator before packaging the app.

The steps to execute these scripts are as follows:

1. Copy the above script files to your the project, and execute the following code to generate AgoraRtmKit.framework:

    ``` bash
      sh change_to_all_arch.sh "<AgoraRtmKit.xcframework path>"
      sh remove_simulator_arch.sh "<AgoraRtmKit.framework path>"
    ```

2. In Xcode, go to the **TARGETS > Project Name > Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries** menu, and click + to add the `AgoraRtmKit.xcframework`. Ensure that the **Embed** attribute of the dynamic library is **Embed & Sign**.

Earlier than v1.4.4 :

1. Copy the AgoraRtmKit.framework file in the libs folder to the project folder.

1. In Xcode, go to the **TARGETS > Project Name > Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries** menu, and click + to add the following frameworks and libraries. To add the **AgoraRtmKit.framework** file, remember to click **Add Other...** after clicking +.

    - AgoraRtmKit.framework
    - libc++.tbd
    - libresolv.tbd
    - SystemConfiguration.framework
    - CoreTelephony.framework
