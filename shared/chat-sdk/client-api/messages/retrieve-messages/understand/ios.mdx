The Chat SDK uses `IAgoraChatManager` to retrieve historical messages from the server. The following are the core methods:

- `getConversationsFromServer`: Retrieves a list of conversations stored on the server.
- `fetchMessagesFromServerBy`: Retrieves historical messages of a conversation from the server according to `AgoraChatFetchServerMessagesOption`, the parameter configuration class for retrieving historical messages.
- `pinConversation`: Pins a conversation.
- `getPinnedConversationsFromServerWithCursor`: Retrieves a list of pinned conversations.
- `removeMessagesFromServerWithTimeStamp`/`removeMessagesFromServerMessageIds`: Deletes historical messages from the server unidirectionally.
- `deleteServerConversation`: Deletes conversations and their historical messages from the server.

The Chat SDK provides the following methods for tagging conversations:

- `addConversationMark`: Tags a conversation.
- `removeConversationMark`: Removes tag of a conversation.
- `getConversationsFromServer`: Queries conversation from the server by the conversation tag.
- Query the local conversations by the conversation tag: Call the `getAllConversations` method to obtain all local conversations and then perform conversation filtering yourself.
- Get all tags of a local conversation: Call `getConversationWithConvId` to get a local conversation, and then use `marks` of the returned object to view all tags associated with a conversation.
