## Implementation

In a complete call invitation process, the call invitation states of the caller and the callee are defined by `LocalInvitation` and `RemoteInvitation,` respectively.

### Send a call invitation

The steps to send a call invitation are as follows:

1.  The caller creates the `LocalInvitation` by calling `createLocalInvitation`; at the same time, the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` begins.

2.  The caller sends a call invitation by calling `send`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` begins as the callee receives the `RemoteInvitationReceived` callback, and then the caller receives the `LocalInvitationReceivedByPeer` callback.

The sample code for sending a call invitation is as follows:
    ```javascript
    // Create LocalInvitation
    localInvitation = Client.createLocalInvitation(calleeId);
    // Send call invitation
    localInvitation.send();
    ```

### Cancel a call invitation

The caller cancels the call invitation by calling `cancelLocalInvitation`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the callee receives the `RemoteInvitationCanceled` callback. And then the lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `LocalInvitationCanceled` callback.

The sample code for canceling a call invitation is as follows:
    ```javascript
    // Cancel call invitation
    cancelCall() {
        localInvitation.cancel();
      }
    ```

### Accept a call invitation

The callee gets `RemoteInvitation` from `RemoteInvitationReceived` and accepts the call invitation by calling `accept`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `RemoteInvitationAccepted` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `LocalInvitationAccepted` callback.

The sample code for accepting a call invitation is as follows:
    ```javascript
    // Accept call invitation
    acceptCall() {
        remoteInvitation.accept();
      }
    ```

### Refuse a call invitation

The callee gets `RemoteInvitation` from `RemoteInvitationReceived` and refuses the call invitation by calling `refuse`. The lifecycle of the `RemoteInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `RemoteInvitationRefused` callback. The lifecycle of the `LocalInvitation` ends as the caller receives the `LocalInvitationRefused` callback.

The sample code for refusing a call invitation is as follows:

    ```javascript
    // Decline call invitation
    refuseCall() {
        remoteInvitation.refuse();
      }
    ```
