To enable <Vg k="NCS" />:

1. In [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/projects), select the project for which you want to enable for <Vg k="NCS" /> and click **Config**.

1. Under **Real-time engagement core**, find **Notification Center Service**, and press **Config**.

1. In **Notification Center Service Configuration**, fill in the following information:
    * **Product Name**: Select the product for which you wish to enable notifications.
    * **Event**: Select the channel events that you want to subscribe to.

        If the events that you want to subscribe to have high queries per second (QPS), such as events `105` and `106`, ensure your server has sufficient processing capacity.

    * **Receive Server URL**: The `HTTPS` public address of your server that receives the notifications. For example, `https:// 1111-123-456-789-99.ap.ngrok.io/ncsNotify`.

        * To enhance security, Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> no longer supports `HTTP` addresses.
        * To reduce the delay in notification delivery, best practice is to activate `HTTP` persistent connection (also called `HTTP` keep-alive) on your server with the following settings:

            * `MaxKeepAliveRequests`: 100 or more
            * `KeepAliveTimeout`: 10 seconds or more

    * **URL Region**: Select the region where your server that receives the notifications is located. Agora connects to the nearest Agora node server based on your specified location.

    * **Secret**: The secret used for signature verification. For further information on how to use the secret for signature verification, see [Add signature verification](#add-signature-verification).
    
    * **Enable IP WhiteList**: If your server is behind a firewall, ensure that you have called the [IP address query API](#ip-address-query-api) to get the IP addresses of the Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> server and added them to the firewall's allowed IP list, and check the box here.

1. Press **Add**. Agora performs a health test for your configuration as follows:

    1. The <Vg k="NCS" /> health test generates test events that correspond to your subscribed events, and then sends test event callbacks to your server. In test event callbacks, the channelName is `test_webhook`, and the uid is `12121212`.

    1. After receiving each test event callback, your server must respond within 10 seconds with a status code of `200`. The response body must be in JSON format.

    1. When the <Vg k="NCS" /> health test succeeds, read the prompt and press **Save <Vg k="NCS" /> Configuration**. After your configuration is approved, the Status of Notification Center Service shows **Enabled**.

        If the <Vg k="NCS" /> health test fails, follow the prompts on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to troubleshoot the error. Common errors include the following:

        * Request timeout (590): Your server does not return the status code 200 within 10 seconds. Check whether your server responds to the request properly. If your server responds to the request properly, contact Agora Technical Support to check if the network connection between the Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> server and your server is working.

        * Domain name unreachable (591): The domain name is invalid and cannot be resolved to the target IP address. Check whether your server is properly deployed.

        * Certificate error (592): The Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> server fails to verify the SSL certificates returned by your server. Check if the SSL certificates of your server are valid. If your server is behind a firewall, check whether you have added all IP addresses of the Agora <Vg k="NCS" /> server to the firewall's allowed IP list.

        * Other response errors: Your server returns a response with a status code other than 200. See the prompt on the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> for the specific status code and error messages.
