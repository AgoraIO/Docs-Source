3. **Configure the project**:

    Open `DocsAppConfig.swift` and replace:

    * `appId` - with your app ID from [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
    * `channelName` - with the name of a channel you want to join.
    * `rtcToken` - with a valid temporary token for the `channelName`.

1.  **Run the <Vpl k="NAME" /> reference app**:

    If this is the first time you run the project, grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

    <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
    If you use an iOS simulator, you see the remote video only. You cannot see the local video stream because of [Apple simulator hardware restrictions](https://help.apple.com/simulator/mac/current/#/devb0244142d).
    </PlatformWrapper>

1. **Join a Channel**:
    <ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
      Select an option and click **Join** to start a session. When you join as a **Host**, the local video is published and played in the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>. When you join as **Audience**, the remote stream is subscribed and played.
    </ProductWrapper>

    <ProductWrapper product="video-calling">
      Click **Join** to start a call. You see yourself on the test device and talk to the web demo app using
      your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.
    </ProductWrapper>
