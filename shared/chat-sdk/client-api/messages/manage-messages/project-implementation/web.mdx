### Pin a conversation

Refer to the following code example to pin a conversation:

```javaScript
connection.pinConversation({conversationId:'conversationId', conversationType: 'singleChat', isPinned: true})
```

### Retrieve the pinned conversations from the server with pagination

The Limit parameter specifies the number of conversations each API call can return, from a range of 1-50. Thus, end users can pin up to 50 conversations. This API sorts all the conversations based on the following order:

1. Pinned conversations with recently received messages. The more recent the messages are, the higher the conversation is sorted/ranked so that it appears on the top of the UI.
1. Pinned conversation without any messages, that is, empty conversations.
1. Unpinned conversations.

The Agora Chat servers store the pinned/unpinned status of active conversations for 7 days, regardless of the package subscription.

Refer to the following code example to get a list of pinned conversations from the server with pagination:

```javaScript
connection.getServerPinnedConversations({pageSize:50, cursor: ''})
```
