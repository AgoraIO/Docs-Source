Agora Cloud Proxy is a feature of Agora's Voice and Video SDKs. It ensures reliable audio and video connectivity for end users when they connect from restricted network environments.

The following figure illustrates how Agora Cloud Proxy works:

![](/images/video-sdk/cloud-proxy-tech.svg)

1. Before connecting to Agora SD-RTN™, the Agora SDK sends a request to the cloud proxy service.
2. When the request succeeds, the cloud proxy service sends back the proxy information.
3. The Agora SDK sends signaling and media data to the cloud proxy service, which then forwards the data to Agora SD-RTN™.
4. Agora SD-RTN™ sends signaling and media data to the cloud proxy service, which then forwards the data to the Agora SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the cloud proxy modes in the SDK, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. You have integrated the SDK and prepared the development environment. 
2. Contact [Agora support](mailto:support@agora.io) and provide the following information to request <Vg k="CP" /> service:
    - App ID
    - <Vg k="CP" /> service usage area
    - Concurrency scale
    - Network operator and other relevant information

## Implementation

To enable Force UDP or Force TCP cloud proxy mode, do the following:

<ProjectImplement/>

4. Test the audio and video call functionality.

#### Considerations

- Agora recommends that you enable cloud proxy before connecting to the channel or after disconnecting from the channel.
- Force UDP cloud proxy mode does not support pushing streams to the CDN or relaying streams across channels.
