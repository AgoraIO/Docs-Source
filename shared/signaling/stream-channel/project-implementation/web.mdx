1. **Setup an event listener**

    Keep track of the users who join and leave topics, and events in the topic. In this implementation, we use the
  event listener in [signalingManager](/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk#handle-events).

1. **Join and leave a channel**

    To create a new stream channel, call `createStreamChannel`. When you join the channel, you configure the features
    you will use. For example, [Presence](/en/signaling/reference/api#presence), [Storage](/en/signaling/reference/api#storage), and [Lock](/en/signaling/reference/api#lock). You use the authentication
    token for the current UID to join the channel. To join a channel:

      ```javascript
        const streamChannelJoinAndLeave = async function (
          isStreamChannelJoined,
          streamChannelName
        ) {
          if (config.rtcToken === null) {
            console.log(
              "please create a rtc token from the console and add the token to the RtcToken variable in 'src/signaling_manager/config.json'"
            );
            return;
          }
          streamChannel = await signalingManager.getSignalingEngine().createStreamChannel(streamChannelName); // creates stream channel

          if (isStreamChannelJoined === false) {
            await streamChannel
              .join({
                token: config.rtcToken,
                withPresence: true,
              })
              .then((response) => {
                console.log(response);
              });
          } else {
            streamChannel.leave().then((response) => {
              console.log(response);
              messageCallback("left channel: " + streamChannelName);
              streamChannel = null;
            });
          }
        };
      ```

1. **Join and leave a topic**

     A topic is a data stream management mechanism in stream channels. Users join, leave, subscribe, and
    unsubscribe to topics. You join a topic to publish and recieve messages sent to all users in the topic.
  You subscribe to listen to messages sent by publishers only. When a user joins or leaves a topic, <Vg k="MESS"/>
  triggers an topic event notification. Users in the channel receive the notifications in real time. You use topic events
  to track changes in topic status. To join a topic:

    ```javascript
     const topicJoinAndLeave = async function (isTopicJoined, topicName) {
        if (config.rtcToken === null) {
          console.log(
            "please create a rtc token from the console and add the token to the RtcToken variable in '<samples-root>/src/signaling_manager/config.json'"
          );
          return;
        }

        if (isTopicJoined === false) {
          await streamChannel.joinTopic(topicName).then((response) => {
            messageCallback("Joined the topic: " + response.topicName);
          });
        } else {
          streamChannel.leaveTopic(topicName).then((response) => {
            console.log(response);
            messageCallback("left topic: " + response.topicName);
          });
        }
      };
    ```

    There is no limit to the number of subscribers and publishers in each topic. However, there are limitations to
  the [number of topics and messages a user can subscribe to](/en/signaling/reference/limitations).

1. **Send messages to a topic**

   Messages are transmitted through the topic. After your user has joined a topic in a channel, you
  publish messages to the topic. Publishers and subscribers receive the messages. To send a message:

    ```javascript
    const sendTopicMessage = function (message, topicName) {
      if (message === "" || topicName === "") {
        console.log(
          "Make sure you specified a message and a topic to send messages"
        );
        return;
      }
      streamChannel.publishTopicMessage(topicName, message).then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
        messageCallback("Topic: " + topicName + ",  Message:" + message);
      });
    };
    ```
