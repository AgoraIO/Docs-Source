## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the overall technical architecture of Flexible Classroom:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

The source code of Flexible Classroom contains the following packages:

- `agora-classroom-sdk`: The Agora Classroom SDK, which contains the following modules:
   - `/src/infra/stores`: The UI stores implement the business logic for the UI components.
   - `/src/ui-kit/capabilities`:
      - `containers`: This folder contains all the business components. A business component is implemented by combining the UI components with the UI stores.
      - `/scenarios`: This folder contains the code for arranging the layout of business components in different scenarios.
- `agora-chat-widget`: The chat widget implemented by the Easemob IM SDK.
- `agora-plugin-gallery`: This package contains the code for plugins in Flexible Classroom, including the screen sharing plugin, Pop-up Quiz, Poll, and Countdown Timer.
- `agora-scenario-ui-kit`: This package contains all the UI function components.
- `agora-widget-gallery`: This package contains the chat widget implemented by the Easemob IM SDK and the chat widget implemented by the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />

## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate Flexible Classroom into your Web project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of Flexible Classroom and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole Flexible Classroom through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agora-classroom-sdk) or CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Flexible Classroom, you need to integrate Flexible Classroom by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Desktop) on GitHub.

### Use the default UI of Flexible Classroom

If you are satisfied with the default UI of Flexible Classroom and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole Flexible Classroom through npm or CDN.

#### Through npm

1. To install the SDK, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install agora-classroom-sdk
   ```

2. To import the `AgoraEduSDK` module, add the following code in the Javascript code in your project.

   ```
   import {AgoraEduSDK} from 'agora-classroom-sdk'
   ```

3. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.

#### Through CDN

1. Add the following code to the HTML file in your project:

   ```html
   <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.6.1.bundle.js"></script>
   ```

2. To launch a classroom, call [Classroom SDK.setConfig](../reference/classroom-sdk#setconfig) and [Classroom SDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch) in the JavaScript code of the project.


#### Sample code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.6.1.bundle.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <style>
        #root {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        AgoraEduSDK.config({
            appId: 'Your App ID',
            region: 'NA'
        });
        AgoraEduSDK.launch(document.querySelector('#root'), {
            userUuid: 'user id',
            userName: 'user name',
            roomUuid: 'room id',
            roleType: 1,
            roomType: 0,
            roomName: 'room name',
            pretest: true,
            rtmToken: 'rtm token', // In a test environment, you can use a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token; in a production or security environment, Agora strongly recommends that you use a server-generated <Vg k="MESS" /> token.
            language: 'en',
            duration: 60 * 30,
            recordUrl: 'https://solutions-apaas.agora.io/apaas/record/dev/2.3.3/record_page.html',
            courseWareList: [],
            listener: (evt, args) => {
            },
        }).then(() => {
            console.log('start launch');
        }).catch((e) => {
            console.error('fail to launch', e);
        });
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what is <Vg k="MESS" /> token, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purpose, and how to generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Flexible Classroom, you need to integrate Flexible Classroom by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:

<div class="alert info">Make sure you have <a href="../get-started">set up the development environment</a>.</div>

1. To clone the CloudClass-Desktop repository and check out the latest release branch, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Desktop.git
   ```

2. To switch the branch, run the following command. Remember to replace `{VERSION}` with a specified version number:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/`{VERSION}`
   ```

   For example, if you want to switch to the branch of v2.6.0, just run the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/2.6.0
   ```

   Agora recommends switching the branch of the latest release. The following image shows how to see the latest release branch in the GitHub repository:

   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1658916187924)

3. After pulling the code to your local device, you are free to edit the code according to your needs. You can refer to the [Customize the Classroom UI guide](../develop/customize-ui).

4. After finishing the development, follow these steps to debug:

   1. To install dependencies, run the following command:

      ```bash
      yarn install
      ```

      ```bash
      yarn bootstrap
      ```

   2. To run the project in development mode, use the following commands:

      ```bash
      yarn dev
      ```

5. After finishing the development, pack the SDK JS file with the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn pack:classroom:sdk
   ```
