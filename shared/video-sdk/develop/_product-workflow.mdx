To use <Vg k="VSDK" /> for audio and video communication, you implement a simple workflow in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a new or an existing channel using an app ID and an authentication token. If a channel of the given name exists within the context of the app ID, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel. If the named channel does not exist, a new channel is created that other users may join. Once the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel, it subscribes to one or more of the audio and video streams published in the channel. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> also publishes its own audio and video streams that other users in the channel subscribe to. Each user publishes streams that share their captured camera, microphone, and screen data.

The basics of joining and leaving a channel are presented in the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk"><Vg k="GET_STARTED"/></Link> project for <Vpd k="NAME"/>. This document explains the common workflows you need to handle in your app.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the typical workflow you integrate into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in order to publish and subscribe to audio and video streams.

This page shows you how to add the following features to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-native">
* **Screen Sharing**

    Enables users in a channel to share what is on their screen with other users in the channel. This technology is useful in several online communication use-cases such as:

    * Sharing a local image or web page for discussion.
    * Showing slides or notes in an online student teacher interaction.
    * Running a third party app for online collaboration or troubleshooting.

</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
* **Switch media input devices**

    A user may plug in, or switch to an alternate input device during a call. The Agora Web SDK provides APIs for managing media devices. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> receives notification of any device changes enabling you to dynamically switch the audio and video media input devices.
</PlatformWrapper>

* **Volume control**

    Users in a channel often need to adjust the volume for local and remote audio. For example, they may want to increase the input volume from remote users and decrease the local audio recording volume. You use <Vg k="VSDK" /> to enable <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> users to adjust recording and playback volumes. <Vg k="VSDK" /> also provides methods to mute local audio, audio from a particular remote user, or audio from all remote users. <Vg k="VSDK" /> provides several methods to manage local and remote audio volumes. These methods enable the user to control:

        * **Recording signal volume**: The volume of the signal recorded by the local user.
    <PlatformWrapper platform="android">
        * **Playback signal volume**: The playback audio level, after audio mixing, for all remote users, or for a specific remote user.
        * **In-ear monitoring volume**: The volume of their own voice, users hear through wired earphones.
    </PlatformWrapper>
    <PlatformWrapper platform="ios">
        * **Playback signal volume**: The playback audio level, after audio mixing, for all remote users, or for a specific remote user.
        * **In-ear monitoring volume**: The volume of their own voice, users hear through wired earphones.
    </PlatformWrapper>
        * **Audio mixing volume**: The mixing volume for local playback and for sending to other users.
        * **Muting audio streams**: Stop or resume playing a specified remote or local audio.
    <PlatformWrapper platform="web">
        * **Muting video streams**: Stop or resume playing a specified remote or local video.
    </PlatformWrapper>
