  Manage cloud recording using the RESTful API
---

Agora Cloud Recording is a component provided by Agora to record and save voice calls, video calls, and interactive streaming. You can send HTTP requests from your business server to the Agora server to manage Cloud Recording tasks on the server side.

To monitor the status of your cloud recording, Agora provides the [message notification service](../develop/receive-notifications). After enabling this service, you receive [events related to cloud recording](../develop/receive-notifications#event-types) through a webhook.

Since Agora dynamically adjusts the IP addresses of the message notification server, best practice is to regularly [query the IP addresses](#get-ncs-ip) and update the firewall whitelist configuration to continue receiving cloud recording notifications.

#### Base URL

`https://api.sd-rtn.com`


## Authentication

When sending an HTTP request, use Basic HTTP authentication and fill in the `Authorization `field in the HTTP request header with the generated credentials. For details on generating the `Authorization` field, see [Authenticate REST calls](../reference/restful-authentication).

## Endpoints
The RESTful API includes the following set of endpoints for managing the cloud recording functionality:

- [`acquire`](#acquire): Request a resource ID for cloud recording.
- [`start`](#start): Call this method within two seconds after getting the resource ID to start cloud recording. During recording, call `query`, `update`, and `updateLayout` methods as needed.
- [`query`](#query): Check the status of cloud recording.
- [`update`](#update): Update recording settings.
- [`updateLayout`](#updatelayout): Update the video mixing layout.
- [`stop`](#stop): To end a recording, call `stop` to leave the channel and stop the recording.

### `acquire`

Get a cloud recording resource ID.

`POST /v1/apps/{appid}/cloud_recording/acquire`

Before starting cloud recording, call the `acquire` method to get a resource ID. One resource ID can be used for only one recording session.

**Note**: To ensure success when starting cloud recording, proceed as follows:
- Call `acquire` and `start` requests in pairs.
- [`start`](#start) cloud recording within two seconds of receiving the resource ID from each `acquire` request. Batch fetching of resource IDs followed by batch `start` requests may lead to request failure.
- The resource ID is valid for five minutes and should be used as soon as possible.

#### Request body

```json
{
  "cname": "httpClient463224",
  "uid": "527841",
  "clientRequest": {
    "scene": 0,
    "resourceExpiredHour": 24
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | header | String | false | `application/json`. |
| `appid` | path | String | true | The [App ID](..overview/core-concepts#app-id) for your project.<li>For web page recording mode, simply enter the App ID for which the cloud recording service is enabled.</li><li>For individual and composite recording modes, use the same App ID as for the channel to be recorded. Ensure that the cloud recording service has been enabled for this App ID.</li> |
| body | body | JSON Object | true | [acquire-request](#acquire-request) |


#### 200 Response

```json
{
  "cname": "string",
  "uid": "string",
  "resourceId": "string"
}
```

#### Response

| status | Description | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| 200 OK | If the returned HTTP status code is `200`, the request is successful. If you set the `startParameter` object in the request body and its value is invalid, it will not affect the success of the` acquire` request, but you will receive an error in the subsequent `start` request. | [acquire-response](#acquire-response) |
| Not 200 | If the HTTP status code is not `200`, see [the response status code](../reference/common-errors#status-codes) for troubleshooting. | [Response status code](../reference/common-errors#status-codes) |


### `start`

Start cloud recording.

`POST /v1/apps/{appid}/cloud_recording/resourceid/{resourceid}/mode/{mode}/start`

After receiving a cloud recording resource ID using the [`acquire`](#acquire) method, call the `start` method to start cloud recording.

<Admonition type="info">
After calling `start`, [best practice](../develop/integration-best-practices) is to check that the recording service has started successfully.

### `updateLayout`

Update the mixing layout of cloud recording.

`POST /v1/apps/{appid}/cloud_recording/resourceid/{resourceid}/sid/{sid}/mode/{mode}/updateLayout`

After starting composite recording, call this method to update the mixing layout.

Each call to this method overrides the original layout settings. For example, if you set the `backgroundColor` field to `"#FF0000"` (red) when starting a recording and call the `updateLayout` method to update the mixing layout without setting the `backgroundColor` field again, the background color will change to black (the default value).

<Admonition type="info">

- The `updateLayout` request is only valid within a session. If the recording was started incorrectly, or if the recording has ended, the `updateLayout` call returns `404`.

- If you need to call the `updateLayout` method successively to update the recording settings, repeat the call after receiving the previous `updateLayout` response to avoid unexpected results.

### `get-ncs-ip`

Query the IP addresses of the message notification server.

`GET /v1/ncs/ip`

Query the IP address or IP address list of the message notification server.

After you enable the message notification service, the Agora message notification service can notify your server of events that occur during a cloud recording with HTTPS requests. Agora dynamically adjusts the IP addresses of the message notification server every 24 hours. Query the IP addresses using this method. After the query, add the IP address (or IP address list) to the whitelist.

<Admonition type="info">
Best practice is to query the IP addresses at least once every 24 hours and automatically update the firewall configuration to avoid interruption in the reception of notifications.
</Admonition>

```json

  "data": {
    "service": {
      "hosts": [

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cname` | String | true | Channel name:<br/> - For individual recording and composite recording modes, this field is used to set the name of the channel to be recorded. <br/>- For web page recording mode, this field is used to differentiate the recording process. The string length cannot exceed 1024 bytes. <br/>**Note**: A unique recording instance can be located through `appid`, `cname`, and `uid`. Therefore, if you intend to record the same channel multiple times, use the same `appId` and `cname`, while differentiating them with different `uid`s. |
| `uid` | String | true | The string contains the UID used by the cloud recording service within the channel to identify the recording service, for example, `"527841"`. The string must meet the following conditions:<br/>- The value is in the range from 1 to (2<sup>32</sup>-1), and cannot be set to `0`. <br/>- It must not duplicate any UID within the current channel. <br/>- The field value within the quotation marks is an integer UID, and all users in the channel should use integer UIDs. |
| `clientRequest` | Object | false | See the following. |
| » `scene` | Number | false | Use cases for cloud recording resources:<br/> - `0`: (default) Real-time audio and video recording. <br/>- `1`: Web page recording. <br/>- `2`: Individual recording mode, with postponed transcoding or audio mixing enabled.<br/>    - Postponed transcoding: The recording service will transcode the recorded files into the MP4 format within 24 hours after the recording ends (in special cases, it may take more than 48 hours), and then upload the MP4 files to your third-party cloud storage. This scene is only applicable to the individual recording mode.<br/>    - Postponed audio mixing: The recording service will merge and transcode the recorded files of all UIDs in the specified channel into a single MP3/M4A/AAC file within 24 hours after the recording ends (in special cases, it may take more than 48 hours), and then upload the file to your specified third-party cloud storage. This scene is only applicable to the individual audio non-transcoding recording mode.<br/>    > - When `scene` is set to `2`, you need to set the `appsCollection`field in the `start` method at the same time.<br/>    > - In scenarios involving postponed transcoding and audio mixing, the recorded files are cached on the Agora edge servers for up to 24 hours. If your business is sensitive to information security and to ensure data compliance, please carefully consider whether to use postponed transcoding and audio mixing functions. Contact Agora technical support if you need assistance. |
| » `resourceExpiredHour` | Number | false | The validity period for calling the cloud recording RESTful API. Start calculating after you successfully initiate the cloud recording service and obtain the `sid` (Recording ID). The calculation unit is hours. The value range is [1,720]. The default value is 72. <br/><br/>**Note**: After the timeout, you will not be able to call the `query`, `update`, `updateLayout`, and `stop` methods. |
| » `startParameter` | [client-request](#client-request) | false | Setting this field can improve availability and optimize load balancing. <br/><br/>**Note**: When populating the `startParameter` object, make sure the values are valid and consistent with the `clientRequest` object in the subsequent `start` request body; otherwise, the `start` request will receive an error response. |
| » `excludeResourceIds` | Array[string] | false | The `resourceId` of another or several other recording tasks. This field is used to exclude specified recording resources so that newly initiated recording tasks can use resources from a new region, enabling cross-regional multi-stream recording. See [Multi-channel task assurance](../develop/integration-best-practices#multi-channel-task-assurance). |
| » `region` | String | false | Specify regions that the cloud recording service can access. By default, the cloud recording service accesses the region where the server you initiated the request is located. Once you specify the access region through `region`, the cloud recording service will not access servers outside the specified region. The region can be set to:<br/>- `"CN"`: Mainland China<br/> - `"AP"`: Asia excluding Mainland China<br/> - `"EU"`: Europe<br/> - `"NA"`: North America<br/>**Note**: When calling the `start` method, the `region` of the third-party cloud storage must be consistent with this field. In scenarios of postponed transcoding and audio mixing, Agora recommends not setting the `region` field. Otherwise, due to the data compliance risks arising from the dynamic adjustment of Agora edge servers and the caching of recording files in scenarios of postponed transcoding and audio mixing, the Agora recording service may fail to function properly. |

| `streamMode` | String | false | Output mode of media stream. See [Media streaming output modes](../reference/stream-mode). <br/>- `"default"`: Default mode. Recording with audio transcoding will separately generate an M3U8 audio index file and a video index file. <br/>- `"standard"`: Standard mode. Agora recommends using this mode. Recording with audio transcoding will separately generate an M3U8 audio index file, a video index file, and a merged audio and video index file. If VP8 encoding is used on the Web client, a merged MPD audio-video index file will be generated. <br/>- `"original"`: Original encoding mode. It is applicable to [individual non-transcoding audio recording](../develop/individual-nontranscoding). This field only takes effect when subscribing to audio only (`streamTypes` is 0).

| `videoWidth` | Number | true | The output video width (pixel). The product of `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` should be less than or equal to 1920 × 1080. For recommended values, see [How can I set the page recording output resolution in mobile web page mode?](/help/integration-issues/mobile_video_profile). |
| `videoHeight` | Number | true | The height of the output video (pixel). The product of `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` should be less than or equal to 1920 × 1080. For recommended values, see [How can I set the page recording output resolution in mobile web page mode](/help/integration-issues/mobile_video_profile). |
| `maxRecordingHour` | Number | true | The maximum duration of web page recording (hours). The web page recording will automatically stop after exceeding this value. The value range is [1,720]. <br/>> The recommended value should not exceed the value you set in the `acquire` method for `resourceExpiredHour`.<br/><p/><b>Billing related</b>: The charge will continue until the web page recording stops, so you need to set a reasonable value according to the actual business situation or stop the page recording voluntarily. |
| `videoBitrate` | Number | false | The bitrate of the output video (Kbps). For different output video resolutions, the default value of `videoBitrate` is different: <br/>- Output video resolution is greater than or equal to 1280 × 720, and the default value is 2000. <br/>- Output video resolution is less than 1280 × 720, and the default value is 1500. |

| `mobile` | Boolean | false | Whether to enable the mobile web mode:<br/>- `true`: Enables the mode. After enabling, the recording service uses the mobile web rendering mode to record the current page. <br/>- `false`: (default) Disables the mode. |
| `maxVideoDuration` | Number | false | Maximum length of MP4 slice file generated by web page recording, in minutes During the web page recording process, the recording service will create a new MP4 slice file when the current MP4 file duration exceeds the `maxVideoDuration` approximately. The value range is [30,240]. The default value is 120. |
| `onhold` | Boolean | false | Whether to pause page recording when starting a web page recording task. <br/>- `true`: Pauses the web page recording that has been started. Immediately pause the recording after starting the web page recording task. The recording service will open and render the page to be recorded, but will not generate slice files. <br/>- `false`: (Default) Starts a web page recording task and performs web page recording. <br/>We suggest using the `onhold` field according to the following process: <br/>1. Set `onhold` to `true` when calling the `start` method, which will start and pause the web page recording, and you need to determine the appropriate time to start the web page recording on your own. <br/>2. Call `update` and set `onhold` to `false`, continue with the web page recording. If you need to pause or resume the web page recording by continuously calling the `update` method, please make the call after receiving the response from the previous `update`, otherwise it may cause inconsistent results with your expectations. |
| `readyTimeout` | Number | false | Set the page load timeout in seconds. See [Page Load Timeout Detection](../develop/webpage-load-timeout). The value range is [0,60]. The default value is 0. <br/>- Set to `0` or not set, which means the web page loading status is not detected. <br/>-An integer between [1,60], representing the page load timeout. |
