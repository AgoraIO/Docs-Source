## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the overall technical architecture of <Vg k="FC"/>:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1653557375318)

<Vg k="FC"/> contains the following libraries:

- `AgoraClassroomSDK`: The glue code that connects `AgoraEduContext`, `AgoraEduUI`, and `AgoraEduCore`. `AgoraClassroomSDK` is an open-sourced project and is released on GitHub and CocoaPods.
- `AgoraEduUI`: This library contains the code for the UI; it also includes all the texts and resource files used by <Vg k="FC"/>. `AgoraEduCore` provides this library with the functionality and data in <Vg k="FC"/> through `AgoraEduContext`. `AgoraEduUI` is an open-source project and is released on GitHub and CocoaPods.
- `AgoraEduContext`: This library defines context protocols and the data structure. `AgoraEduContext` is an open-source project and is released on GitHub and CocoaPods.
- `AgoraEduCore`: This library provides the capabilities and data in <Vg k="FC"/> and follows the protocols defined in ` AgoraEduContext`. `AgoraEduCore` is a closed-source library and is released on CocoaPods as a binary package.
- `Widget`: This library provides independent plugins that include both interfaces and functions. `AgoraClassroomSDK` injects these plugins into <Vg k="FC"/>. Widgets can communicate with each other.

The following figure shows the structure of <Vg k="FC"/>.

## Integrate <Vg k="FC"/> through CocoaPods

To use the default UI of <Vg k="FC"/>, take the following steps to add remote dependencies and integrate the whole <Vg k="FC"/> through CocoaPods:

1. Open your project with Xcode and add the following code to the project's `Podfile`:

    ```swift
    # 3rd-party libs
    pod 'Protobuf', '3.17.0'
    pod 'CocoaLumberjack', '3.6.1'
    pod 'AliyunOSSiOS', '2.10.8'
    pod 'Armin', '1.1.0'
    pod 'SSZipArchive', '2.4.2'
    pod 'SwifterSwift', '5.2.0'
    pod 'Masonry', '1.1.0'
    pod 'SDWebImage', '5.12.0'

    # agora service libs
    pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS/RtcBasic', '3.6.2'
    pod 'AgoraMediaPlayer_iOS', '1.3.0'
    pod 'AgoraRtm_iOS', '1.4.8'
    pod 'Agora_Chat_iOS', '1.0.6'
    pod 'Whiteboard', '2.16.39'

    # agora flexible classroom open source libs
    pod 'AgoraClassroomSDK_iOS', '2.8.0'
    pod 'AgoraEduUI', '2.8.0'
    pod 'AgoraWidgets', '2.8.0'

    # agora flexible classroom close source libs
    pod 'AgoraUIBaseViews', '2.8.0'
    pod 'AgoraEduCore', '2.8.0'
    pod 'AgoraWidget', '2.8.0'
    ```

    The following diagram provides an example:

2. Navigate into the project directory in the terminal and run `pod install` to install the dependencies as the following picture shows:

    <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1650596467294" />

3. Import the header files using the matching code for the programming language of your project:

    - For Swift projects:
        ```swift
        // Swift
        import AgoraClassroomSDK_iOS
        ```

    - For Objective-C projects:
        ```objc
        // Objective-C
        import <AgoraClassroomSDK_iOS/AgoraClassroomSDK.h>
        ```

4. To launch the classroom, call [AgoraClassroomSDK.launch](../reference/classroom-sdk#launch). Sample code:

    - For Swift projects:
        ```swift
        // Swift
        let appId = ""  // Your app ID
        let rtmToken = ""  // Your signaling token
        let userUuid = ""  // Your user ID

        let launchConfig = AgoraEduLaunchConfig(userName: "User name",  // The user name
                                                userUuid: userUuid,  // The user ID
                                                userRole: .student,  // The user role
                                                roomName: "Room name",  // The room name
                                                roomUuid: "Room ID",  // The room ID
                                                roomType: 4,  // The room type, 0: One-to-one interactive teaching, 2: Big class, 4: Online interactive small class
                                                token: rtmToken,  // In a test environment, you can use a temporary signaling token; in a production or a security environment, Agora strongly recommends using a server-generated signaling token instead.
                                                appId: appId,
                                                startTime: nil,  // The starting time of the class
                                                duration: NSNumber(value: 7200),  // The class duration
                                                region: region.eduType,  // The area
                                                mediaOptions: nil,  // Media stream related settings
                                                userProperties: nil)  // User properties defined by the developer

        AgoraClassroomSDK.setDelegate(self)
        AgoraClassroomSDK.launch(launchConfig, success: launchSuccessBlock, failure: failureBlock)
        ```

    - For Objective-C projects:
        ```objc
        // Objective-C
        AgoraEduMediaEncryptionConfig *config = [[AgoraEduMediaEncryptionConfig alloc] initWithMode:0 key:nil];

        AgoraEduMediaOptions *media = [[AgoraEduMediaOptions alloc] initWithEncryptionConfig:config videoEncoderConfig:nil latencyLevel:2 videoState:1 audioState:1];

        AgoraEduLaunchConfig *launchConfig =
        [[AgoraEduLaunchConfig alloc] initWithUserName:@"User name"  // The user name
                                              userUuid:userUuid  // The user ID
                                              userRole:AgoraEduLaunchConfig.student  // The user role
                                              roomName:@"Room name"  // The room name
                                              roomUuid:@"Room ID"  //The room ID
                                              roomType:4  // The room type, 0: One-to-one interactive teaching, 2: Big class, 4: Online interactive small class
                                                 token:@"Your signaling Token"  // In a test environment, you can use a temporary signaling token; in a production or security environment, Agora strongly recommends using a server-generated signaling token instead.
                                                 appId:@"The app ID"
                                             startTime:nil  // The starting time of the class
                                              duration:[NSNumber numberWithInt:7200]  // The class duration
                                                region:0  // The area
                                          mediaOptions:media  // Media stream-related settings
                                        userProperties:nil];  // User properties defined by the developer

        [AgoraClassroomSDK launch:launchConfig success:^{
           NSLog(@"success");
        } failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull err) {
           NSLog(@"failure");
        }];
        ```

    The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what <Vg k="MESS" /> token is, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purpose, and how to generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.

## Considerations

- `AgoraEduCore` is a binary Swift framework. Since Appleâ€˜s support for binary Swift frameworks is not strong enough, Agora adds an OC wrapper to avoid compatibility issues. If you use `import AgoraEduCore` to import `AgoraEduCore`, you may encounter an error saying that the Swift version is not compatible. Use the following ways to solve this error:

    1. Make project language-specific changes:
        - For Objective-C projects:
            1. Use `#import <AgoraEduCorePuppet/AgoraEduCoreWrapper.h>` to import `AgoraEduCore`.
            1. Add a user-defined setting in the build settings:
                1. Set `Key` as SWIFT_VERSION.
                1. Set `Value` as your required Swift version.

        - For Swift projects: Use `import AgoraEduCorePuppet` to import `AgoraEduCore`.

    1. Replace the `AgoraEduCore` class with the `AgoraEduCorePuppet` class.
