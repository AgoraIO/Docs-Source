### Known issues

<KnownIssues />

### v4.4.0

v4.4.0 was released on August 29, 2024.

#### Compatibility changes

1. **Changes to API usage**

    Starting from this release, the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine
    .html#api_createagorartcengine">Get</Link> and <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine
    .html#api_irtcengine_release">Release</Link> methods are used for creation and destruction of engine instances, replacing the previous
    `createAgoraRtcEngine` and `release` methods. This change simplifies instance management. Details are as follows:

        - Creating an engine instance: Call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine
        .html#api_createagorartcengine">Get</Link> to create an `IRtcEngine` instance and return a pointer to
        `AgoraUERtcEngine`. You can directly call methods under <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine
        .html#class_irtcengine">IRtcEngine</Link> using this pointer.

            ```cpp
            // Example of joining a channel using joinChannel
            AgoraUERtcEngine::Get()->joinChannel(TCHAR_TO_UTF8(*Token), TCHAR_TO_UTF8(*ChannelName), 0, ChannelMediaOptions);
            ```

        - Destroying an engine instance: After calling <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_createagorartcengine">Get</Link> to create an `IRtcEngine` instance, call <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_UE_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_release">Release</Link> to destroy the engine instance and release related resources.

            ```cpp
            AgoraUERtcEngine::Release();
            ```

#### New features

1. **Voice AI tuner**

   This version introduces the voice AI tuner feature, which can enhance the sound quality and tone, similar to a
   physical sound card. You can enable the voice AI tuner feature by calling the `enableVoiceAITuner` method. Pass in
   the sound effect types supported in the `VOICE_AI_TUNER_TYPE` enum to achieve effects like deep voice, cute voice,
   husky singing voice, and so on.

1. **Privacy manifest file (iOS)**

   To meet Apple's safety compliance requirements for app publication, the SDK now includes a privacy manifest file, `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, detailing the SDK's API calls that access or use user data, along with a description of the types of data collected.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Note">If you need to publish an app with SDK versions prior to v4.4.0 to the Apple App Store, add the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file to your Xcode project.</Admonition>

1. **Multi-camera capture (Android)**

   This release introduces additional functionalities for Android camera capture:

   1. Support for capturing and publishing video streams from the third and fourth cameras:

      - `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_THIRD` (11) and `VIDEO_SOURCE_CAMERA_FOURTH` (12) in `VIDEO_SOURCE_TYPE` add support for Android, specifically for the third and fourth camera sources. This change allows you to specify up to four camera streams when initiating camera capture by calling `startCameraCapture`.
      - `publishThirdCameraTrack` and `publishFourthCameraTrack` in `ChannelMediaOptions` add support for Android. Set these parameters to `true` when joining a channel with `joinChannel`[2/2] to publish video streams captured from the third and fourth cameras.

   1. Support for specifying cameras by camera ID:

      A new parameter `cameraId` is added to `CameraCapturerConfiguration`. For devices with multiple cameras, where `cameraDirection` cannot identify or access all available cameras, you can obtain the camera ID through Android's native system APIs and specify the desired camera by calling `startCameraCapture` with the specific `cameraId`.

1. **Select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming**

   This release introduces the `selectMultiAudioTrack` method that allows you to select different audio tracks for local playback and streaming to remote users. For example, in scenarios like online karaoke, the host can choose to play the original sound locally and publish the accompaniment in the channel. Before using this function, open the media file through the `openWithMediaSource` method and enable this function by setting the `enableMultiAudioTrack` parameter in `MediaSource`.

1. **Update video screenshot and upload**

   To facilitate the integration of third-party video moderation services from Agora Extensions Marketplace, this version has the following changes:

   - The `CONTENT_INSPECT_IMAGE_MODERATION` enumeration is added in `CONTENT_INSPECT_TYPE`, which means using video moderation extensions from Agora Extensions Marketplace to take video screenshots and upload them.
   - An optional parameter `serverConfig` is added in `ContentInspectConfig`, which is for server-side configuration related to video screenshot and upload via extensions from Agora Extensions Marketplace. By configuring this parameter, you can integrate multiple third-party moderation extensions and achieve flexible control over extension switches and other features. For more details, please contact [technical support](mailto:support@agora.io).

   Additionally, this version introduces the `enableContentInspectEx` method, which supports simultaneous screenshot and upload of multiple video streams.

1. **ID3D11Texture2D rendering (Windows)**

   As of this release, the SDK supports video formats of type ID3D11Texture2D, improving the rendering effect of video frames in game scenarios. You can set `format` to `VIDEO_TEXTURE_ID3D11TEXTURE2D` when pushing external raw video frames to the SDK by calling `pushVideoFrame`. By setting the `textureSliceIndex` property, you can determine the ID3D11Texture2D texture object to use.

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user ID. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can prevent repeated application of tokens every time users join a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Generate wildcard tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow#generate-wildcard-tokens).

   <Admonition type="info" title="Note">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</Admonition>

1. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannel` and `preloadChannelWithUserAccount` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shorten the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear and see the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to prevent repeated application of tokens every time you join a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Generate wildcard tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow#generate-wildcard-tokens).

1. **Publishing video streams from different sources** (Windows, macOS)

   This release adds the following members in `ChannelMediaOptions` to allow you to publish video streams captured from the third and fourth camera or screen:

   - `publishThirdCameraTrack`: Publishing the video stream captured from the third camera.
   - `publishFourthCameraTrack`: Publishing the video stream captured from the fourth camera.
   - `publishThirdScreenTrack`: Publishing the video stream captured from the third screen.
   - `publishFourthScreenTrack`: Publishing the video stream captured from the fourth screen.

   <Admonition type="info" title="Note">For one <code>RtcConnection</code>, Agora supports publishing multiple audio streams and one video stream at the same time.</Admonition>

#### Improvements

1. **Header file management simplification**

    To reference other header files, you can add them uniformly to `AgoraHeaderBase.h`, simplifying the management of header files in the project and facilitating future maintenance.

1. **Channel media relay**

   The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

#### Issues fixed

In Unreal Engine 5.3 and 5.4, adding the following code to the `/Source/xxx.Target.cs` file in your project to solve iOS memory allocation issues may lead to missing iOS compilation symbols. To address this issue, this version adds three function definitions (`StdMalloc`, `StdRealloc`, and `StdFree`) related to the standard library in the `UnrealMemory.cpp` file, ensuring proper handling of memory management needs when using the standard memory allocator (iOS).

```csharp
if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.IOS)
{
    bOverrideBuildEnvironment = true;
    GlobalDefinitions.Add("FORCE_ANSI_ALLOCATOR=1");
}
```
