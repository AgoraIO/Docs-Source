In addition to the Voice/Video SDK integrated into the app client, Agora provides RESTful APIs for channel management, with which you can manage users in the channel and query channel statistics at the app server.

This page provides detailed help for the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

### Domain

All requests are sent to the domain name: `api.agora.io`.

### Data format

The `Content-Type` field in all HTTP request headers is `application/json`. All requests and responses are in JSON format. All request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.

### Authentication

The Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs only support HTTPS. Before sending HTTP requests, you must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the **Customer ID** and **Customer Secret** provided by Agora, and pass the credential to the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [RESTful authentication](/video-calling/reference/restful-authentication).

### Call frequency limit

For each Agora account (not each App ID), the call frequency of each online channel statistics query API is no more than 20 queries per second, and the call frequency of each other API is no more than 10 queries per second. If you are frequency limited when calling the APIs, please see [How can I avoid being frequency limited when calling Agora Server RESTful APIs](/help/integration-issues/restful_api_call_frequency/) to optimize API call frequency.

### Response status codes

For response status codes that can be returned when calling the channel management RESTful API, refer to [Error codes](response-status-code).
