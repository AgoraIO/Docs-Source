After joining an Chat channel, a user can update information such as the nickname, avatar, age, and mobile phone number as needed. These are known as user attributes.

This page shows how to use the Chat SDK to implement managing user attributes.

<div class="alert note"><ul><li>User attributes are stored on the Chat server. If you have security concerns, Agora recommends that you manage user attributes yourself.</li><li>To ensure information security, app users can only modify their own user attributes. Only app admins can modify the user attributes of other users.</li></ul></div>

## Understand the tech

<Understand />

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have integrated the Chat SDK, initialized the SDK and implemented the functionality of registering accounts and login. For details, see <Link to="/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-sdk?platform={{platform.PATH}}">Get Started with Chat</Link>.
- Have a thorough understanding of the API call frequency limit, the maximum size of all the attributes of a specified user, and the maximum size of all user attribtues in an app. For details, see [Known limitations](../reference/limitations).

## Implementation

This section shows how to manage user attributes and contacts with the methods provided by the Chat SDK.

<ProjectImplement />

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
## Reference

This section includes reference information that you may need to know during the implementation.

- For detailed information on user attributes, refer to the following API Reference:
  - [AgoraChatUserInfo](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/API%20Reference/im_oc/interface_agora_chat_user_info.html)
  - [fetchUserInfoById](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/API%20Reference/im_ts/modules/Contact.html)
</PlatformWrapper>

## Next steps

This section introduces extra functions you can implement in your app using user attributes and contact management.
