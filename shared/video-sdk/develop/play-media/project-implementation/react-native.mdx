### Implement the user interface

In a real-word application, you provide several buttons to enable a user to open, play, pause and stop playing files in the media player. In this page, you use a single button to demonstrate the basic media player functions.

To add the button, in `App.tsx`:

1. Add the following component to the `return` statement of the `App` component before `<ScrollView`:
    ```typescript
    <MediaPlayerButton />
    ```

1. The `MediaPlayerButton` component displays a suitable caption depending on the state of the media player. To define this component, add the following code to the `App` component:

    ```typescript
    const MediaPlayerButton = () => {
        var caption = '';

        if (!isUrlOpened) {
            caption = 'Open media file';
        } else if (isPaused) {
            caption = 'Resume playing media';
        } else if (isPlaying) {
            caption = 'Pause playing media';
        } else {
            caption = 'Play media file';
        }

        return (
            <Text onPress={playMedia} style={styles.button}>
                {caption}
            </Text>
        );
    };
    ```

### Handle the system logic

To setup your project to use the media player APIs, take the following steps:

1. **Import the relevant <Vg k="COMPANY" /> classes**

    Add the following to the list of `import` statements in `App.tsx`:

    ```typescript
    import {
        IMediaPlayer,
        VideoSourceType,
        MediaPlayerState,
        ChannelMediaOptions,
    } from 'react-native-agora-rtc-ng';
    ```

1. **Declare the variables you need**

    Take the following steps:
    
    1. To specify the path to the media file, add the following declaration to `App.tsx` after `const uid = 0;`:

        ```typescript
        const mediaLocation = 'https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Custom-VideoSource-Web/assets/sample.mp4';
        ```
    
    1. To create and manage an instance of `IMediaPlayer` and configure the UI elements, add the following declarations to the `App` component after `const [message, setMessage] = useState('');`:

        ```typescript
        const mediaPlayerRef = useRef<IMediaPlayer>(); // Media player instance
        const [isUrlOpened, setIsUrlOpened] = useState(false); // Media file has been opened
        const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); // Media file is playing
        const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false); // Player is paused
        var duration = 0; // Total duration of the media file
        ```

### Implement media player functions

To implement playing and publishing media files in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, take the following steps:

1.  **Open, play and pause media files**

    When a user presses the button for the first time, you create an instance of the media player and open the media file. When the user presses the button again, you play the media file. On subsequent button presses, you pause or resume playing the media file alternately. To do this, add the following method to the `App` component:

    ```typescript
    const playMedia = () => {
        if (!isJoined) {
            return;
        }

        if (!isUrlOpened) {
            initializeMediaPlayer();
            // Open the media file
            mediaPlayerRef.current?.open(mediaLocation, 0);
        } else if (isPaused) {
            // Resume playing
            mediaPlayerRef.current?.resume();
            setIsPaused(false);
            showMessage('Media file playing');
        } else if (isPlaying) {
            // Pause media player
            mediaPlayerRef.current?.pause();
            setIsPaused(true);
            showMessage('Media player paused');
        } else {
            // Play the loaded media file
            mediaPlayerRef.current?.play();
            setIsPlaying(true);
            updateChannelPublishOptions(true);
            showMessage('Media file playing');
        }
    };
    ```

1.  **Initialize the media player and manage callbacks**

    During initialization, you create an instance of `IMediaPlayer` and register a `IMediaPlayerSourceObserver` to receive media player callbacks. When the player state changes, you take appropriate actions to update the UI in `onPlayerStateChanged`. You use the `onPositionChanged` callback to update the play progress in the UI. To do this, add the following code to the `App` component:

    ```typescript
    const initializeMediaPlayer = () => {
        mediaPlayerRef.current = agoraEngineRef.current?.createMediaPlayer();

        mediaPlayerRef.current?.registerPlayerSourceObserver({
            onPlayerSourceStateChanged: (
            state: MediaPlayerState,
        ) => {
            if (state === MediaPlayerState.PlayerStateOpenCompleted) {
                // Media file opened successfully
                duration = mediaPlayerRef.current?.getDuration()!;
                setIsUrlOpened(true);
            } else if (
                state === MediaPlayerState.PlayerStatePlaybackAllLoopsCompleted
            ) {
                // Media file finished playing
                setIsPlaying(false);
                // Restore camera and microphone streams
                updateChannelPublishOptions(false);
                showMessage('Media file finished playing');
            }
        },
        onPositionChanged: position => {
            // Use position and duration to
            // update your play progressBar here.
        },
        });
    };
    ```

1.  **Configure <Vg k="ENGINE" /> to publish the media player stream**

    You use `ChannelMediaOptions` and the `updateChannelMediaOptions` method to specify the type of stream to publish. To switch between publishing media player and camera and microphone streams, add the following method to the `App` component:

    ```typescript
    const updateChannelPublishOptions = (publishMediaPlayer: boolean) => {
        var channelOptions = new ChannelMediaOptions();
        channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerAudioTrack = publishMediaPlayer;
        channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerVideoTrack = publishMediaPlayer;
        channelOptions.publishAudioTrack = !publishMediaPlayer;
        channelOptions.publishCameraTrack = !publishMediaPlayer;
        if (publishMediaPlayer) {
            channelOptions.publishMediaPlayerId =
                mediaPlayerRef.current?.getMediaPlayerId();
        }

        agoraEngineRef.current?.updateChannelMediaOptions(channelOptions);
    };
    ```

1.  **Display media player preview locally**

    To show the media player preview locally, you create an `RtcSurfaceView` component, set its `sourceType` to `VideoSourceMediaPlayer` and specify the media player ID. To enable switching between displaying media player output and the camera stream, do the following:
    
    1. **Replace** the first `RtcSurfaceView` component block in the `return` statement of `App` with the following:

        ```typescript
        <LocalPreview />
        ```
    1. To define the `LocalPreview` component, add the following method to `App`:

        ```typescript
        const LocalPreview = () => {
            if (!isPlaying) {
                return <RtcSurfaceView canvas={{uid: 0}} style={styles.videoView} />;
            } else {
                return (
                    <RtcSurfaceView
                    style={styles.videoView}
                    canvas={{
                        uid: mediaPlayerRef.current?.getMediaPlayerId(),
                        sourceType: VideoSourceType.VideoSourceMediaPlayer,
                        }}
                    />
                );
            }
        };
        ```

</PlatformWrapper>
