Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. In <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, this key level of security is implemented in the form of token authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they can access <Vpd k="NAME"/>. A token is a dynamic key that is generated from a given set of inputs. All <Vg k="COMPANY" /> [core products](https://www.agora.io/en/products/) are protected using token security.

In order to build a seamless authentication process for your users, you need to integrate token generation into your [identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) system. This guide helps you integrate <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token generation libraries into your authentication system. The integration of <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token generation and authentication in your security infrastructure provides an additional level of security while allowing you to retain control of the overall authentication process.

## Understand the tech

When a user attempts to connect to an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> channel from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> requests a token from your authentication system. Your authentication system uses <Vg k="COMPANY" /> libraries to generate a token specific to the channel, then sends it to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token to <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> with the request to join a channel. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and adds the user to the channel. The following diagram shows the authentication call flow between your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, your authentication system and <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />:

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have an authentication server project in which you wish to integrate token generation.


## Project setup

Open the project in which you wish to integrate token generation.

## Integrate token generation into your authentication system

When a user sends an authentication request to your server, the server must check the userâ€™s credentials against your internal security and business logic. If everything is in order, the server returns an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> authentication token to the <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then uses this token to join a channel.

This section shows you how to integrate <Vg k="COMPANY" /> token generation into your authentication system code.

## Test your implementation

To test the validity of tokens you generate through your integrated authentication system, take the following steps:
