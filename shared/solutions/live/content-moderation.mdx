Currently, cloud-based screenshots only support the integration with third-party moderation service providers to achieve video moderation functionality. You need to select a third-party service provider and implement the moderation logic yourself. 


**Pricing for Cloud-based Screenshots**
The moderation part will be subject to the billing policies of the third-party moderation service provider.


>*The Cloud-based Screenshots solution does not consume bandwidth, and we recommend you to use this solution when the network environment is unstable or bandwidth conditions cannot be guaranteed.*



#### Raw Video Data

This solution directly sends the raw video data obtained by the Agora Cloud Marketplace video plugin to the cloud marketplace partners for moderation. The moderation results are then sent to the address you've set up in the form of HTTP requests. By default, the moderation results are only called back when inappropriate or illegal content is detected.
