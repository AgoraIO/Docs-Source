### Import the required Agora libraries

    <ImportLibrary />

### Declare the required variables

    <SetDeclarations/>

### Use a probe test to check network health

    <ProbeTest />

### Implement best practice for app initiation

    Use the following <Vg k="ASDK" /> features when you set up an instance of the <Vg k="ENGINE" />:

    * _Enable and configure logging_: For optimization and debugging.
    <PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
    * _Set an audio profile and audio scenario_: Setting an audio profile is optional and only required if you have special requirements such as streaming  music.
    </PlatformWrapper>    
    * _Start a network probe test_: A quick test at startup to gauge network quality.

    <SetupEngine />

### Test the user's hardware

    The echo test checks that the user's hardware is working properly.

    <TestHardware />

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="react-js">
### Receive state change notifications and quality statistics

    Use the following callbacks monitor and ensure channel quality:

    <HandleEvents />

### Set the latency level

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming">
    For ultra low-latency applications, set the appropriate audience latency level when joining a channel. Ultra-low latency is a feature of <Vg k="ILS" /> and its use is subject to special [pricing](../reference/pricing#unit-pricing).
    </ProductWrapper>
    <ProductWrapper product="broadcast-streaming">
    For low-latency applications, set the appropriate audience latency level when joining a channel. Low latency is a feature of <Vg k="BS" /> and its use is subject to special [pricing](../reference/pricing#unit-pricing).
    </ProductWrapper>
