- A Premium or Enterprise <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Support package

#### Configuration steps

   In the **SAML Configuration** section on the [SSO Management](https://console.agora.io/settings/m_sso) page in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, enter the following information from Okta Console:

1. Manage access

   You can manage access for your team members manually using SAML, which is enabled when you apply for Okta
   integration in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, or automatically, if you additionally enable SCIM. Manual management means that adding, managing, and removing a team member's access must be done in both, Okta and <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. Automatic management means that SCIM automatically adds, manages, and removes members' access to <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> when you make changes in Okta.

   **Note**: Once enabled, SAML is applicable for both, existing and newly created <Vg k="COMPANY" /> accounts for team members. For new accounts, however, log in as the admin in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and create an account *before* it is configured in Okta. SCIM is applicable only for new accounts.

   - Manual management with SAML

     1. In <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, add team members and choose their teams. For details, see [Manage members and teams](#manage-members-and-teams).
     1. In Okta Console, go to **Directory** > **People**. Ensure that the email address of each team member is the same as that in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.
     1. Go to **Applications** > **Applications** > **Agora integration**.
     1. On the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** and select **Assign to People**.
     1. Enter the team members that need to sign in to <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> and click **Assign** for each. Click **Done**.

   - Automated management with SCIM

     1. In <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, enable **SCIM API Basic Auth** on the **SSO Management** page. A set of username and password is generated, along with the SCIM connector base URL.
        ![scim-enabled](/images/common/scim-enabled.png)

        - Under **Supported provisioning actions**, tick all the checkboxes.

After enabling and configuring Okta integration, the [Big Bang feature](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/reference/glossary.htm) is enabled by default. This means that login
to <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> with email and password is no longer available and your team members can log in only through Okta.
