7. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your development device as you move the slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap the **Mute** checkbox while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app.
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your development device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in the `ProductWorkflowManager.cs` file, locate `ChangeVolume` and replace the `AdjustRecordingSignalVolume` call with one of the following:

        ```csharp
        agoraEngine.AdjustPlaybackSignalVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.AdjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUid,volume);
        agoraEngine.AdjustAudioMixingVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.AdjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.AdjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(volume);
        agoraEngine.SetInEarMonitoringVolume(volume);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.


    1. To test other mute methods, in `ProductWorkflowManager.cs` file, locate `muteRemoteAudio` and replace the `MuteRemoteAudioStream` call with one of the following:

        ```csharp
        agoraEngine.MuteAllRemoteAudioStreams(value);
        agoraEngine.MuteLocalAudioStream(value);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `Mute` checkbox to test the effect of these mute methods.
