### Declare the variable to hold a <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance

    You use these objects to communicate with <Vg k="SIG" />.

    <EngineInstance />

### Define configuration parameters

    Best practice is to keep these parameter values separate from your code. For example, in the <Vg k="SIG" /> reference app, you use the following `JSON` configuration file.

    <DeclareVariables />

### Configure a <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> instance

    Your code reads the parameters from the configuration file, initializes the SignalingEngine instance and adds the event listeners.

    <ConfigureEngine/>

### Handle and respond to  <Vg k="SIG" /> events
    <a id="handle-events"></a>

    <RespondToEvents/>
    
### Login to <Vg k="SIG" />

    Each token is specific to a user ID. If `uid` and `token` do not match, your user cannot log in to <Vg k="SIG" />.

    <Login/>    

### Subscribe to a channel

    To start receiving messages and event notifications from a channel, you call `subscribe`.

    <Subscribe/>

### Send a message

    Messages are published directly to a channel.

    <Publish/>

    You setup the event handlers for messages received from other users during <Vg k="MESS_ENGINE" /> initiation.

### Unsubscribe from a channel

    When you no longer need to receive channel notifications, call `unsubscribe`.

    <Unsubscribe/>

### Logout of <Vg k="SIG" />

    Had enough of the conversation? Just logout.

    <Logout/>

You have just implemented the <Vg k="SIG" /> messaging channel workflow. Yes, it's as easy as that.
