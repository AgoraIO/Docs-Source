A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You use webhooks to notify your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> or back-end system when certain <Vpd k="PRODUCT" /> events occur. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> enables you to subscribe to events and receive notifications about them across multiple product lines.

## Understand the tech

Using <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> you subscribe to specific events for your project and configure the URL of the webhooks to receive these events. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> sends notifications of your events to your webhook every time they occur. Your server authenticates the notification and returns `200 Ok` to confirm reception. You use the information in the JSON payload of each notification to give the best user experience to your users.

<ProductWrapper notAllowed="media-gateway">
The following figure illustrates the workflow when <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> is enabled for the specific <Vpd k="NAME" /> events you subscribe to:

</ProductWrapper>

1. A user commits an action that creates an event.
1. <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> sends an HTTPS POST request to your webhook.
1. Your server validates the request signature, then sends a response to <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> within 10 seconds. The response body must be in JSON.

If <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> receives `200 OK` within 10 seconds of sending the initial notification, the callback is considered successful. If these conditions are not met, <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> immediately resends the notification. The interval between notification attempts gradually increases. <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> stops sending notifications after three retries.

## Prerequisites

To set up and use <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, you must have:

- A [valid Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-account).
- An [active Agora project](../reference/manage-agora-account#create-an-agora-project).
- A computer with Internet access.
    
    If your network access is restricted by a firewall, call the [IP address query API](#ip-address-query-api) to retrieve the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> IP addresses , then configure the firewall to allow these IP addresses.

## Handle notifications for specific events

In order to handle notifications for the events you subscribe to, you need to:
- [Create your webhook](#create-your-webhook)
- [Enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />](#enable-notifications)
- [Verify <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> signatures](#add-signature-verification)
<ProductWrapper product="video-calling, voice-calling, interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
- [Handle redundant notifications and abnormal user activity](#handle-redundant-notifications-and-abnormal-user-activity)
- [Implement online user status tracking](#implement-online-user-status-tracking)
 
</ProductWrapper>

### Create your webhook

Once <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> is enabled, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends notification callbacks as `HTTPS POST` requests to your webhook when events that you are subscribed to occur. The data format of the requests is JSON, the character encoding is `UTF-8`, and the signature algorithm is `HMAC/SHA1` or `HMAC/SHA256`.

For <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, a webhook is an endpoint on an `HTTP` server that handles these requests. In a production environment you write this in your web infrastructure, for development purposes best practice is to create a simple local server and use a service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to supply a public URL that you register with  <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> when you enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />.

To do this, take the following steps:

1. **Set up Go**

    Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).

2. **Create a Go project for your server**

    Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

    ```sh
    mkdir agora-webhook-server
    cd agora-webhook-server
    ```

    In the project directory, create a new file `main.go`. Open the file in your preferred text editor and add the following code:

    ```go
    package main
    
    import (
      "encoding/json"
      "fmt"
      "io"
      "log"
      "net/http"
    )

    type WebhookRequest struct {
        NoticeID   string `json:"noticeId"`
        ProductID  int64  `json:"productId"`
        EventType  int    `json:"eventType"`
        Payload    Payload `json:"payload"`
    }

    type Payload struct {
        ClientSeq   int64  `json:"clientSeq"`
        UID         int    `json:"uid"`
        ChannelName string `json:"channelName"`
    }

    func rootHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        response := `<h1>Agora Notifications demo</h1>`
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        w.Write([]byte(response))
    }

    func ncsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        agoraSignature := r.Header.Get("Agora-Signature")
        fmt.Println("Agora-Signature:", agoraSignature)

        body, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Unable to read request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }

        var req WebhookRequest
        if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &req); err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Invalid JSON", http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }

        fmt.Printf("Event code: %d Uid: %d Channel: %s ClientSeq: %d\n",
            req.EventType, req.Payload.UID, req.Payload.ChannelName, req.Payload.ClientSeq)

        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        w.Write([]byte("Ok"))
    }

    func main() {
        http.HandleFunc("/", rootHandler)
        http.HandleFunc("/ncsNotify", ncsHandler)

        port := ":8080"
        fmt.Printf("Notifications webhook server started on port %s\n", port)
        if err := http.ListenAndServe(port, nil); err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Failed to start server: %v", err)
        }
    }
    ```

1. **Run your Go server**


    Run the server using the following command:
    
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

1. **Create a public URL for your server**

    In this example you use `ngrok` to create a public URL for your server.

    1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). If you have `Chocolatey`, use the following command:

        ```bash
        choco install ngrok
        ```
    
    1. Add an `authtoken` to ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok config add-authtoken <authToken>
        ```

        To obtain an `authToken`, [sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) with ngrok.

    1. Start a tunnel to your local server using the following command:

        ```bash
        ngrok http 127.0.0.1:8080
        ```
        You see a **Forwarding** URL and a **Web Interface** URL in the console. Open the web interface URL in your browser.

1. **Test the server**

    Open a web browser and navigate to the public URL provided by `ngrok` to see the root handler response.

    Use curl, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or another tool to send a `POST` request to `https://<ngrok_url>/ncsNotify` with the required `JSON` payload.

    Example using `curl`:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST <ngrok_url>/ncsNotify \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Agora-Signature: your_signature" \
    -d '{
      "noticeId": "some_notice_id",
      "productId": 12345,
      "eventType": 1,
      "payload": {
        "clientSeq": 67890,
        "uid": 123,
        "channelName": "test_channel"
      }
    }'
    ```
    
    Make sure you replace `ngrok_url` with the forwarding url.

    Once the HTTP request is successful, you see the following `JSON` payload in your browser:

    ```json
    {
      "noticeId": "some_notice_id",
      "productId": 12345,
      "eventType": 1,
      "payload": {
        "clientSeq": 67890,
        "uid": 123,
        "channelName": "test_channel"
      }
    }
    ```

### IP address query API

If your server that receives notification callbacks is behind a firewall, call the IP address query API to retrieve the IP addresses of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> and configure your firewall to trust all these IP addresses.

Agora occasionally adjusts the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> IP addresses. Best practice is to call this endpoint at least every 24 hours and automatically update the firewall configuration.

#### Prototype

* Method: `GET`
* Endpoint: `https://api.agora.io/v2/ncs/ip`

#### Request header

Authorization: You must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the Customer ID and Customer Secret provided by Agora, and then pass the credential to the Authorization field in the HTTP request header. 

#### Request body

This API has no body parameters.

#### Response body

When the request succeeds, the response body looks like the following:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "service": {
            "hosts": [
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                },
                {
                    "primaryIP": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Each primary IP field shows an IP address of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> server. When you receive a response, you need to note the primary IP fields and add all these IP addresses to your firewall's allowed IP list.

### Considerations

* <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> does not guarantee that notification callbacks arrive at your server in the same order as events occur. Implement a strategy to handle messages arriving out of order.
* For improved reliability of <Vg k="NCS_LONG" />, your server may receive more than one notification callback for a single event. Your server must be able to handle repeated messages.

  <Admonition type="info" title="Tip">
  To implement a strategy to ensure that you log only one callback event and ignore duplicate events, use a combination of the `noticeId` and `notifyMs` fields in the response body. 
  </Admonition>
