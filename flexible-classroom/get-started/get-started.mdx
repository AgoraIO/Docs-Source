This page explains how to  quickly launch a flexible classroom.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to join a flexible classroom.

When an app client requests to join a flexible classroom, the app client and your app server interact with the Agora server in the following steps:

GRE

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server to apply for an <Vg k="SIG" /> token.
2. Your app server generates an <Vg k="SIG" /> token using the Agora [App ID](/flexible-classroom/reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](/flexible-classroom/reference/manage-agora-account/#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. For details, see [Generate an <Vg k="SIG" /> Token]( /flexible-classroom/develop/authentication-workflow/).
3. Your app client calls an API to join a flexible classroom with the following parameters:
    - The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. A string generated by your security system. Must be the same as the user ID that you use for generating an <Vg k="SIG" /> token.
    - The room ID: A string for identifying a classroom. When your app user joins a flexible classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
    - The <Vg k="SIG" /> token: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when your app user joins a flexible classroom.
