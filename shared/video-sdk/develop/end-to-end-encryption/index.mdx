To enhance data security, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> provides media stream encryption and end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption encrypts the media stream on the sending device and decrypts it on the receiving device, ensuring that third parties cannot access the data during transmission.

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
The end-to-end encryption is based on the [WebRTC Encoded Transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-encoded-transform/) standard. However, since WebRTC Encoded Transform is still maturing and may have compatibility or performance issues, there are some restrictions on its use:

- Only VP8 video and Opus audio are supported.
- It supports publishing and receiving audio and video streams between Web clients only, with no cross-platform compatibility or bypass streaming services.
- The SEI information transmission feature cannot be enabled due to conflicts with browser components.

## Understand the tech

The end-to-end encryption technology is based on the following key concepts:

- **WebRTC Encoded Transform**: A technology for encoding transformations in WebRTC. It provides a read and write interface for encoded WebRTC data, enabling developers to convert encoding formats, adjust bit rates, or apply filters.

- **WebRTC Encoded Transform processing pipeline**: A sequence of operations used to process WebRTC encoded data.

- **RTCRtpSender and RTCRtpReceiver**: Standard WebRTC components. `RTCRtpSender` handles sending encoded data, while `RTCRtpReceiver` is responsible for receiving it. Together, they form the WebRTC Encoded Transform processing pipeline.

- **RTCRtpTransceiver**: A WebRTC API for managing both audio and video streams. `RTCRtpSender` and `RTCRtpReceiver` are accessible through the `.sender` and `.receiver` properties of the `RTCRtpTransceiver` object.

For each audio or video track, the Web SDK offers the `getRTCRtpTransceiver` method to retrieve the `RTCRtpTransceiver`. After obtaining `RTCRtpSender` and `RTCRtpReceiver` from `RTCRtpTransceiver`, set up the WebRTC Encoded Transform processing pipeline to encrypt and decrypt audio or video data.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have implemented the [SDK quickstart](../get-started/get-started-sdk) in your project. 
- A supported browser:
    - Chrome (desktop and mobile): version 87 or later
    - Safari (desktop and mobile): version 15.4 or later
- Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable end-to-end encryption.
