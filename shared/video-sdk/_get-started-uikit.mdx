<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vg k="vUIK" /> makes it easy to add <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/> to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in minutes. <Vg k="vUIK" /> is an Open Source project that includes best practices for business logic, as well as a pre-built video UI. Every piece is customizable, so the developer has full control over how the video call looks and feels.

This page outlines the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency <Vpd k="NAME"/> functionality into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> with a customizable UI.

## Understand the tech

<Vg k="vUIK" /> simplifies the implementation of <Vpd k="NAME"/> by handling common calling logic such as remote user status, and displaying it in a pre-built customizable UI. <Vg k="vUIK" /> contains the following components:

![Image](/images/video-sdk/video-call-uikit.png)

To use <Vg k="UIK" />, you implement the following steps in your app:

1.  **Create an instance of the viewer**

    Declare and initialize an instance of the <Vg k="UIK" /> viewer.

2.  **Join a channel**

    When you execute the `join` command, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to [<Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />](../overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn), and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.

    Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

<PrerequisitesGetStarted />

## Project setup

To integrate <Vpd k="NAME"/> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> using <Vg k="UIK" />, do the following:

<ProjectSetup />

## Implement a client for <Vpd k="NAME"/>

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented <Vpd k="NAME"/> in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. <Link target="_blank" to = "../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token">Generate a temporary token</Link> in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

1. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.
