This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic <Vpd k="NAME"/> app using the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

To start a <Vpd k="NAME" /> session, implement the following steps in your app:

- **Initialize the <Vg k="ENGINE" />**: Before calling other APIs, create and initialize an <Vg k="ENGINE" /> instance.

- **Join a channel**: Call methods to create and join a channel.

    <ProductWrapper product="interactive-live-streaming, broadcast-streaming">
    - **Join as a host**: A live streaming event has one or more hosts. A host publishes <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> to the channel. Hosts can also subscribe to streams from other hosts.

    - **Join as audience**: Audience members can only subscribe to streams published by hosts.

- **Send and receive <Vpd k="MEDIA" />**: All users can publish streams to the channel and subscribe to <Vpd k="MEDIA" /> streams published by other users in the channel.
