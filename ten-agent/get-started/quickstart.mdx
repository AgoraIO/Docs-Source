This quickstart guide walks you through setting up and running the <Vpd k="NAME"/> to experiment with different AI models, speech services, and communication tools. Using the interactive <Vpd k="NAME" /> playground you can test and configure AI agents to:

- Experiment with different AI models, TTS/STT systems, and real-time communication
- Test agent behavior in a controlled environment
- Configure extensions and modules through a visual interface

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Agora credentials from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />** 

    - [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project)
    - [App Certificate](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) 

- **API keys for your chosen services**
    - LLM service like OpenAI or Google Gemini
    - STT service such as Azure 
    - TTS service like ElevenLabs or Azure TTS

- **Development environment**  
    Install one of the following:

    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended)
    - [Node.js(LTS) v18](https://nodejs.org/en)

- **System requirements**

    - CPU: Dual-core processor or higher
    - Memory: 4 GB RAM minimum

## Set up the project

Start by getting the code and configuring the basic environment with your credentials.

### Clone the repository

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework.git
```

### Configure environment

1. Switch to the project directory and create a `.env` file from the template:

    ```sh 
    cd ten-framework/ai_agents
    cp ./.env.example ./.env
    ```

1. Open `.env` and add your Agora credentials:

    ```bash title=".env"
    AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
    AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_certificate_here
    ```

1. Add API keys and other configuration parameters to the `.env` file for the LLM, STT, and TTS extensions you want to test. Following are some commonly used parameters:

    ```bash
    # Extension: gemini_llm
    # Gemini API key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=

    # Extension: openai_chatgpt
    # OpenAI API key
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_API_KEY=
    OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

    # Extension: agora_rtc
    # Azure STT key and region
    AZURE_STT_KEY=
    AZURE_STT_REGION=

    # Extension: azure_tts
    # Azure TTS key and region
    AZURE_TTS_KEY=
    AZURE_TTS_REGION=

    # Extension: elevenlabs_tts
    # ElevenLabs TTS key
    ELEVENLABS_TTS_KEY=
    ```

    <Admonition type="info">
    You can also configure these API keys later through the playground interface.

### Start Docker containers

Run the `docker` command to compose containers:

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up -d
```

## Build and run 

Follow these steps to build and run <Vpd k="NAME" />:

1. Enter the development container

    ```bash 
    docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash
    ```

1. Build the agent

    Use the following command to build the agent:

    ```bash 
    task use
    ```

1. Start the web server


    ```bash 
    task run
    ```

### Configure your agent

The playground interface allows you to test different configurations and see results in real-time. Each graph type supports specific extensions and capabilities - Voice Agent for speech interactions, Realtime Agent for low-latency communication.

To get started:

1. Open the playground at `http://localhost:3000`

1. Configure your agent:

    1. Select a graph type (Voice Agent or Realtime Agent) from the dropdown.

    1. Click the module configuration button. Select extension modules such as STT, TTS, and LLM from the panel. The system saves settings to `property.json` when you click **Save changes**. For further details, see [Configure modules](../config/modules).

    1. Click the settings button to configure extensions with required API keys and parameters. For further details, see [Configure properties](../config/properties).

    1. To configure STT and TTS languages, see [Configure languages](../config/change-language).

### Modify the code directly
You can edit the configuration files directly if you prefer manual control. Open `agents/property.json`, locate the graph you want to modify, and update any values.
After saving your changes, refresh the playground page and reconnect to the agent. Your changes take effect immediately.
