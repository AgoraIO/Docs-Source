### 3. Integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" />

Refer to the following steps to integrate the <Vg k="SIG_SDK" /> into the sample project:

1.  Download the [<Vg k="SIG" />](https://github.com/AgoraIO/RTM) repository on Github, and locate the `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Android` folder.

2.  Download the latest version of [Real time Messaging SDK (Android Java)](../reference/downloads.html) and extract the files.

3.  Copy the `*.jar` file in the SDK folder into the `libs` directory of the project folder, and copy the `x86_64`, `x86`, `arm64-v8a`, and `armeabi-v7a` folders to `Agora-RTM-Tutorial-Android\app\src\main\jniLibs`.

### 4. Run the sample project

Refer to the following steps to run the sample project:

1.  Open `app` with Android Studio. Android automatically syncs the project with gradle.

2.  After successful syncing, enter your App ID in **app &gt; res &gt; values &gt; strings_config.xml**.

    ``` xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>
            <string translatable="false" name="agora_app_id">Your App ID</string>
    </resources>
    ```

3.  Compile and run the sample project. Enter any string as the user ID (such as `userA`) and click **Login** to log into <Vg k="SIG" />.

    You need to specify the user ID yourself. The user ID supports the following character set:

    -   All lowercase English letters: a to z

    -   All uppercase English letters: A to Z

    -   All numeric characters: 0 to 9

    -   The space character.

    -   Punctuation characters and other symbols, including: "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "&lt;", "=", ".", "&gt;", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "\|", "\~", ","
