To test the sample code, follow these steps:

1. Generate a <Vg k="SIG"/> token using the [Token Builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/):

   1. Select **Signaling** from the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> products dropdown.
   2. Enter your App ID and App Certificate from the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Leave the remaining fields blank.
   3. Click **Generate Token**.

2. Update the configuration:

   In `signaling.tsx`, replace the following values with your credentials:

   * `APP_ID`: Your App ID
   * `TOKEN`: The generated token
   * `CHANNEL_ID`: Your channel name
   * `USER_ID`: A unique user ID

3. Run the app from your project root:

   * **Android**:

     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```

   * **iOS**:

     ```bash
     npm run ios
     ```

4. Log in on the first device:

   * Use this device as the receiver.
   * Enter your **User ID**, and click **Login**.
     On successful login, the <Vpl k="CLIENT"/> automatically subscribes to the specified channel.

5. Log in on a second device:

   * Use this device as the sender.
   * Enter a different **User ID**, and click **Login**.
   * Type a message and click **Send**.

6. Switch roles:

   * Use the first device as the sender and the second as the receiver.
   * Repeat the previous steps to test bidirectional messaging.
     Congratulations! You've successfully integrated <Vg k="SIG" /> into your project.
