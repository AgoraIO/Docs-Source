Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. <Vg k="COMPANY" />
uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access <Vg k="MESS" />. Each token is valid
for a limited period and works for a specific UID only. For example, you cannot use a token generated for UID
`john` for UID `doe`.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use
it to connect securely to <Vg k="MESS" /> as a specific user. You use this server for development
purposes. To see how to develop your own token generator and integrate it into your production IAM system, read
[Token generators](/signaling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with <Vg k="MESS"/>:

![token authentication flow](/images/signaling/authentication-workflow.svg)

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns
an authentication token that is valid for a specific user.

When a user attempts to connect to <Vg k="MESS" />, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />  retrieves a token from the
token server in your security infrastructure. Your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> then sends this token  to <Vg
k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> for authentication. <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> validates the token and reads the user and
project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:

-   The [App ID](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-id) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The [App certificate](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate) of your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> project

-   The UID of the user to be authenticated

-   The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

When the token is about to expire, <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> sends an event to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and you renew
the session with a new token.


## Prerequisites

To follow this page, you must have:

- Setup the [<Vg k="MESS"/> SDK sample project](/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk#project-setup).

- Created a [Railway](https://railway.app/) account verified through your GitHub account.

If you want to integrate a token generator directly into your security infrastructure, see [Token generators](/video-calling/develop/integrate-token-generation).

## Implement the authentication workflow

In the <Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>, the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> uses an authentication token obtained manually from <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to join a channel. In a production environment, your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1.  [Create and run a token server](#create-and-run-a-token-server)
2.  [Retrieve and use tokens from a token server](#authentication-using-the-sdk)

### Create and run a token server
