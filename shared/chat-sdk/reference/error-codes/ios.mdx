| 3 | `AgoraChatErrorDatabaseOperationFailed` | The database operation fails. |
| 4 | `AgoraChatErrorExceedServiceLimit` | The usage exceeds the service limit. For example, the total number of registered users or contacts exceeds the limit of the current [pricing plan](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=ios). |
| 8 | `AgoraChatAppActiveNumbersReachLimitation` | The app has reached its maximum number of daily active users (DAU) or monthly active users (MAU). |
| 100 | `AgoraChatErrorInvalidAppkey` |  The App Key is invalid. For how to get the App Key, see [Get the information of the Agora Chat project](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/get-started/enable?platform=android#get-chat-project-information). |
| 101 | `AgoraChatErrorInvalidUsername` | The user ID is invalid. For example, when you request to add a contact, the user ID is set to an empty string. |
| 102 | `AgoraChatErrorInvalidPassword` | The login password is empty or invalid. |
| 104 | `AgoraChatErrorUsernameTooLong` | The user ID is too long. Log in again with a valid user ID. |

| 108 | `AgoraChatErrorTokenExpire` | The token has expired. |
| 109 | `AgoraChatErrorTokeWillExpire` | The token has passed half of its validity period. |
| 110 | `AgoraChatErrorInvalidParam` | Invalid parameter. |
| 200 | `AgoraChatErrorUserAlreadyLoginSame` |  The user has already logged in. |
| 201 | `AgoraChatErrorUserNotLogin` | The user hasn't logged in. For example, the login session is either invalid or has expired when a user requests to send a message or perform operations to a chat group. |
| 202 | `AgoraChatErrorUserAuthenticationFailed` | The user authentication fails because the token is invalid or has expired. |
| 203 | `AgoraChatErrorUserAlreadyExist` | The user ID specified during user account registration already exists.  |

| 206 | `AgoraChatErrorUserLoginOnAnotherDevice` | The user has logged in on another device. If the multi-device service is not enabled, the user is forced to log out of the current device upon successful login on another device with the same account. |
| 207 | `AgoraChatErrorUserRemoved` | The user account is deleted on the <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>.|

| 210 | `AgoraChatErrorUserPermissionDenied` | The user has no permission to perform this operation. For example, a user that is banned attempts to send a message. |
| 213 | `AgoraChatErrorUserBindAnotherDevice`  | The user has logged in to another device. This error occurs when a user has logged in on one device and try to log in on another one with the same account, if the app is configured to persist the login state on the current device while preventing the login on another device in a single-device login scenario. This error code is deprecated. |
| 214 | `AgoraChatErrorUserLoginTooManyDevices` | The user has reached the maximum number of devices on which he or she can log in with the same user account. This error occurs on a device with auto login enabled in a multi-device login scenario if the app turns on the switch of login on another device never kicking the user off on a current login device when the maximum number of login devices is exceeded. For example, a user can log in on at most four devices. At first, the user stays logged in on four devices, A (with auto login enabled), B, C, D. Then, the user gets logged out on device A due to network disruption and logs in on device E manually. After the network is available, auto login is performed on device A and fails due to the limit of login devices, triggering this error. |
| 215 | `AgoraChatErrorUserMuted` | The user is muted and not allowed to send messages in a chat group or chat room. |

| 220 | `AgoraChatErrorUserDeviceChanged`  | The device on which a user attempts to log in is not the last one in a single-device login scenario. By default, if a user logs in on a another device, he or she will get kicked off from the current device in a single-device login scenario. This error occurs if the app turns on the switch of keeping the logged-in state on the current device if a user attempts to log in on another device. |
| 221 | `AgoraChatErrorUserNotOnRoster` | The user cannot send a message to another user that is not on the contact list. This error occurs if the switch of allowing message sending only between contacts is turned on. |
