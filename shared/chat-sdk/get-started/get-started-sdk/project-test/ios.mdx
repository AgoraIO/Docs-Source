To try sending and receiving text messages, follow the steps on two clients:

1. Enter a user ID (such as `Localuser` and `Remoteuser`) and a password (such as `123456`), and click `Register` on each client to create two Chat users.

2. Log into Chat as `Localuser`, type `Remoteuser` for `Peer username`, and send a text message.
