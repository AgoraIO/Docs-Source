<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
As of v4.5.0, both <Vpd k="SDK" /> and Signaling SDK (v2.2.0 and above) include the `aosl.dll` library. If you manually integrate <Vpd k="SDK" /> via CDN and also use Signaling SDK, delete the earlier version of the `aosl.dll` library to avoid conflicts. You can check the version by viewing the `aosl.dll` file properties.
