## Integration methods

You can use multiple methods to integrate Flexible Classroom into your Electron project. Depending on whether you need to customize the classroom UI, you can choose different integration methods:

- If you are satisfied with the default UI of Flexible Classroom and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole Flexible Classroom through CDN.
- If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Flexible Classroom, you need to integrate Flexible Classroom by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Desktop) on GitHub.

### Use the default UI of Flexible Classroom

If you are satisfied with the default UI of Flexible Classroom and do not want to change any of it, integrate the whole Flexible Classroom through CDN. To use this integration method, you must have an existing Electron project with the Electron version higher than 12.0.0.

1. Add the following code to the Electron entry file:

   ```javascript
   const electron = require('electron');
   app.allowRendererProcessReuse = false;
   ```

2. When creating a `BrowserWindow` object, pass in the following parameters:

   ```javascript
   mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
     ...
     webPreferences: {
       ...
       autoplayPolicy: "no-user-gesture-required",
       nodeIntegration: true,
       contextIsolation: false,
       webSecurity: false,
       webviewTag: true,
       enableRemoteModule: true,
       nativeWindowOpen: true,
       backgroundThrottling: false
     }
   });
   ```

3. Add the following dependencies and configurations to `package.json`:

   ```json
   "agora_electron": {
     "electron_version": "12.0.0",
     "prebuilt": true
   },
   "dependencies": {
     ...
     "agora-electron-sdk": "3.5.1-build.1116",
   }
   ```

4. Import the Agora Classroom SDK in the HTML file and launch a classroom:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <script src="https://download.agora.io/edu-apaas/release/edu_sdk@2.6.1.bundle.js"></script>
    </head>

    <body>
        <style>
            #root {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
        </style>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            AgoraEduSDK.config({
                appId: 'Your App ID',
                region: 'NA'
            });
            AgoraEduSDK.launch(document.querySelector('#root'), {
                userUuid: 'user id',
                userName: 'user name',
                roomUuid: 'room id',
                roleType: 1,
                roomType: 0,
                roomName: 'room name',
                pretest: true,
                rtmToken: 'rtm token', // In a test environment, you can use a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token; in a production or security environment, Agora strongly recommends that you use a server-generated <Vg k="MESS" /> token.
                language: 'en',
                duration: 60 * 30,
                recordUrl: 'https://solutions-apaas.agora.io/apaas/record/dev/2.3.3/record_page.html',
                courseWareList: [],
                listener: (evt, args) => {
                },
            }).then(() => {
                console.log('start launch');
            }).catch((e) => {
                console.error('fail to launch', e);
            });
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    The sample code requires passing in `rtmToken`. You can refer to [Generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-an-rtm-token) to learn what is <Vg k="MESS" /> token, how to get a temporary <Vg k="MESS" /> token for testing purpose, and how to generate an <Vg k="MESS" /> token from the server.

### Customize the classroom UI

If you want to customize the classroom UI based on the default UI of Flexible Classroom, you need to integrate Flexible Classroom by downloading the source code on GitHub. Refer to the following steps:

<div class="alert info">Make sure you have <a href="/cn/agora-class/agora_class_quickstart_electron?platform=Electron#dev-env">set up the development environment</a>.</div>

1. To clone the CloudClass-Desktop repository and check out the latest release branch, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Desktop.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd CloudClass-Desktop
   ```

2. To switch the branch, run the following command. Remember to replace `{VERSION}` with a specified version number:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/`{VERSION}`
   ```

   For example, if you want to switch to the branch of v2.6.0, just run the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/2.6.0
   ```

   Agora recommends switching the branch of the latest release. The following image shows how to see the latest release branch in the GitHub repository:

   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1658916187924)

3. To copy an environment variable configuration file, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example packages/agora-classroom-sdk/.env
   ```

4. After pulling the code to your local device, you are free to edit the code according to your needs. You can refer to the [Customize the Classroom UI guide](/en/agora-class/agora_class_custom_ui_web?platform=Electron).

5. After finishing the development, follow these steps to debug:

   1. To install dependencies, run the following command:

      ```bash
      yarn install
      ```

      ```bash
      yarn bootstrap
      ```

   2. To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

      ```bash
      yarn dev:electron
      ```

6. After finishing the development, pack the SDK or app with the following commands:

   - To pack the Electron macOS client:

      ```bash
      yarn build:demo
      yarn pack:electron:mac
      ```

   - To pack the Electron Windows client:

      ```bash
      yarn build:demo
      yarn pack:electron:win
      ```
