In addition to the Voice/Video SDK integrated into the app client, Agora provides RESTful APIs for channel management, with which you can manage users in the channel and query channel statistics at the app server.

This page provides detailed help for the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

## Basic information

This section provides basic information about the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

### Domain

All requests are sent to the domain name: `api.agora.io`. See [Ensure service reliability](#ensure-service-reliability) for alternate domain names.

### Data format

The `Content-Type` field in all HTTP request headers is `application/json`. All requests and responses are in JSON format. All request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.

### Authentication

The Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs only support HTTPS. Before sending HTTP requests, you must generate a Base64-encoded credential with the **Customer ID** and **Customer Secret** provided by Agora, and pass the credential to the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. See [HTTP authentication](/video-calling/reference/restful-authentication).

### Call frequency limit

For each Agora account (not each App ID), the call frequency of each <a href="#channelinfo">online channel statistics query</a > API is no more than 20 queries per second, and the call frequency of each other API is no more than 10 queries per second. If you are frequency limited when calling the APIs, please see [How can I avoid being frequency limited when calling Agora Server RESTful APIs](/help/integration-issues/restful_api_call_frequency/) to optimize API call frequency.

## Banning user privileges

To maximize the success of core APIs such as POST, PUT, and DELETE, the success rate and accuracy of the GET method may be compromised, especially when the network connection is poor due to abnormal fluctuations. In the response of the GET method, some request parameters may be missing.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">

When calling POST to create a rule (`time` is not set to 0), that you need to update or delete later, we recommend the following operations:

* Save the rule ID returned in the POST request on your server, and rely on this ID for subsequent update and delete operations.
* To ensure that you can still obtain the rule ID returned in POST during poor network connections, set the timeout for the POST request to 20 seconds or higher. Make sure that the timeout is set to no less than 5 seconds.
* In case the POST request times out or returns a `504` error, use the response of the GET method to obtain the rule ID. If the rule exists, it indicates that the POST request is successful, and you can save the rule ID on your server.

</Admonition>

### Creates a rule

Creates a rule of banning specified user privileges.

The user privileges (`privileges`) that can be banned include the following:

- `join_channel`: Joining a channel.

- `publish_audio`: Publishing audio.

- `publish_video`: Publishing video.

The banning rule works based on the following three fields: `cname`, `uid`, and `ip`.

 When you set `privileges` as `join_channel`, the rule works as follows:

 - If you set `ip`, but not `cname` or `uid`, then all users with this `ip` cannot join any channel in the app.
      
   Using `ip` as a filter field may incorrectly block users who should not be blocked, for example, in a scenario where multiple users share an IP address.

- If you set `cname`, but not `uid` or `ip`, then no one can join the channel specified by the `cname` field.

  Using `cname` as a filter field directly blocks the channel with the `cname`.

- If you set `uid`, but not `cname` or `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot join any channel in the app.

- If you set `cname` and `uid`, but not `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot join the channel specified by the `cname` field.

When you set `privileges` as `publish_audio` or `publish_video`, the rule works as follows:

- If you set `ip`, but not `cname` or `uid`, then the users with this `ip` cannot publish audio or video in any channel of the app.

- If you set `cname`, but not `uid` or `ip`, then no one can publish audio or video in the channel specified bythe `cname` field.

- If you set `uid`, but not `cname` or `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot publish audio or video inany channel of the app.

- If you set `cname` and `uid`, but not `ip`, then the user with the user ID cannot publish audio or video inthe channel specified by the `cname` field.

A user who is kicked out of a channel (that is when you set `privileges` as `join_channel`) receives one of the following callbacks based on their platform:

- Android: The `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- iOS/macOS: The `connectionChangedToState` callback reports `AgoraConnectionChangedBannedByServer(3)`.
- Web (3.x): The `Client.on("client-banned")` callback.
- Web (4.x): The `Client.on("connection-state-change")` callback.
- Windows:The  `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- Electron: The `AgoraRtcEngine.on("connectionStateChanged")` callback reports `3`.
- Unity: The `OnConnectionStateChangedHandler` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.
- React Native: The `ConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `BannedByServer(3)`.
- Flutter: The `ConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `BannedByServer(3)`.
- Cocos Creator: The `onConnectionStateChanged` callback reports `CONNECTION_CHANGED_BANNED_BY_SERVER(3)`.

### Gets the user list

Gets the list of all users in a specified channel.

The return list differs with the channel profile as follows:

- In `COMMUNICATION` profile, this API returns the list of all users in the channel.
- In `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile, this API returns the list of all hosts and audience members in the channel.

<div><ul><li>Users in a channel must use the same channel profile; otherwise, the query results may be inaccurate.</li>
<li>You can synchronize the online channel statistics either by calling this API or by calling the <a href="#userstatus">Gets the user status</a> API. Compared with the <a href="#userstatus">Gets the user status</a> API, this API requires a lower call frequency and has a higher query efficiency. Therefore, Agora recommends using this API to query online channel statistics.</li></ul></div>.

### Gets the channel list

Gets the list of all channels under a specified project.

This API gets the channel list by page. In the request URL, you can specify the page number and the number of channels shown on the page. A successful request returns the channel list of the specified page according to the set `page_size`.

<div class="alert note">If the number of users in a channel changes frequently, the query results may be inaccurate. The following situations may occur: <ul><li>A channel appears repeatedly in different pages.</li><li>A channel does not appear in any page.</li></ul></div>
