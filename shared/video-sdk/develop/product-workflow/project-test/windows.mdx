3. In **Solution Explorer**, open `AgoraImplementationDlg.cpp` and update `APP_ID`, `ChannelName` and `Token` with the values from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.


4. In Visual Studio, click **Local Window Debugger**. A moment later, you see the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> running on your development device.

    If this is the first time you run your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, grant camera and microphone permissions.

6. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your development device as you move the slider on the `Slider Control` to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap **Mute** while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your development device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `OnNMCustomdrawSlider2`, replace the `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` call with one of the following:

        ```cpp
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(value);
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUId,value);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(value);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(value);
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(value);
        agoraEngine.setInEarMonitoringVolume(value);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `OnBnClickedCheck1` replace the `muteRemoteAudioStream` call with one of the following:

        ```cpp
        agoraEngine.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isChecked);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(isChecked);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.

7. **Test Screen sharing**

     Press **Share Sharing**. You see your device screen shared in the web demo <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> and a preview on your development device. Press the same button again, you see screen sharing is stopped and the camera stream is restored in the web demo app.
