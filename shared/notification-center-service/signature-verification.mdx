## Signature Verification
To improve the communication security between the Agora NCS server and your server, Agora uses signatures for identity verification. The following steps show how to verify a signature:

1. When you configure the NCS on the Agora Console, Agora generates a Secret. You need to save it for signature verification.
2. When sending a notification callback to your server, the Agora NCS server generates two signature values by using the secret and the `HMAC/SHA1` and `HMAC/SHA256` algorithms, and then it adds the signature values to the `Agora-Signature` and `Agora-Signature-V2` fields of the HTTPS request header.
3. After receiving the notification callback, you can verify either `Agora-Signature` or `Agora-Signature`-V2. To verify Agora-Signature,use the secret, the raw request body, and the `HMAC/SHA1` algorithm; to verify `Agora-Signature-V2`, use the secret, the raw request body,and the `HMAC/SHA2` algorithm.

You can refer to the following signature verification code samples:

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# !-*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 import (
 import (
# Get the raw request body of the message notification and calculate the
signature. The request_body in the following code is a binary byte array
before deserialization and not a dictionary after deserialization.
request_body = '{"eventType":10,"noticeId":"4eb720f0-8da7-11e9-a43e53f411c2761f","notifyMs":1560408533119,"payload":{"a":"1","b":2},"
productId":1}'
secret = 'secret'
signature = hmac.new(secret, request_body, hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()
print(signature) # 033c62f40f687675f17f0f41f91a40c71c0f134c
