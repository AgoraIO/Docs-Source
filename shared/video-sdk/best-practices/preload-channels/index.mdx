## Implementation

Follow these steps to implement chanel preloading:

1. Preload on the channel list page

    On the channel list page, preload the channels within the user's view area with the `preload` method.

        - If the total number of channels does not exceed 10, preload all channels.
        - If the total number of channels exceeds 10, preload only the first 10 channels. If the user scrolls the channel list, then when the scrolling stops preload the new channels in the user's view area.

    The `token` parameter of the `preload` method can use a [wildcard token](../get-started/authentication-workflow#generate-wildcard-tokens) to speed up the subsequent joining of the channel.

1. Interact with a single channel entry

    Implement preloading for different mouse interactions:
