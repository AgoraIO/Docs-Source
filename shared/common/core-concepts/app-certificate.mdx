### App Certificate

An App Certificate is a unique key generated by the <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to secure projects through token authentication. It is required, along with the App ID, to generate a token that proves authorization between your systems and <Vg k="COMPANY" />'s network. App Certificates are used to generate <Vpd k="NAME" /> authentication tokens.

Store the App Certificate securely in your backend systems. If your App Certificate is compromised or to meet security compliance requirements, you can invalidate certificates and create new ones through the <Vg k='CONSOLE' />.
