You can receive the alerts through e-mails or API callbacks and take action accordingly.

Alert Notifications provides the following features:

-   Predefined metrics that allow for easy alert creation.

-   Support for sending alerts to multiple contacts through multiple channels.

-   Automatic storage of the alert records for the last 7 days.

-   Data synchronization with [Call Inspector](call-inspector/call-search) and [Data Insights](./data-insight), so that you can easily dive into problem analysis.

## Getting started

To access the Alert Notifications page, do the following:

1.  Subscribe to a [pricing plan](../understand/pricing) to enable the **Alert Notifications** service.

2.  Log in to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), and click **<Vpd k="NAME"/>** &gt; **Alert Notifications** on the left navigation bar.

## Alert rules

An alert rule consists of three parts: associated product, rule settings, and notification type.

This section introduces how to create, enable, edit, and delete an alert rule. It also provides parameter descriptions for alert callbacks.

### Create an alert rule

To create an alert rule, do the following:

1.  On the top of the page, click **Alert rules**.

2.  In the upper-left corner, select a project from the dropdown menu.

3.  In the upper-right corner, click the **Create a rule** button, and fill in the following information in the pop-up window:

### Alert callback parameters

If you create an alert callback for an alert rule, Agora sends requests to the URL you provide when the rule is triggered. Currently, the alert callback function has the following limitations:

-   No authentication mechanism is supported, including HTTP authentication.

-   If a request fails, Agora resends the request up to a maximum of two times. The timeout period for each request is two seconds.

-   Agora sends a request whenever the alert rule is triggered.

-   The outbound IP address of the alert callback API may change. You can do one of the following:

-   (Recommended) Open port 80 for your security group.

-   If opening port 80 is not an available option to you, contact Agora to get the outbound IP address. Note that when Agora changes the IP address, you need to make changes accordingly.

Alert information is sent to you through HTTP POST methods in JSON format. The following sections provide parameter descriptions and request examples for your reference.
