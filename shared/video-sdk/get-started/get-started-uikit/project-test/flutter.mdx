3.  In `/lib/main.dart`, update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values for your temporary token.

1.  Connect a test device to your development device.

1.  In your IDE, click **Run app** or launch your app from the terminal using `flutter run`. A moment later you see the project installed on your device.

    If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT"/>.

6. Now, you can see yourself and the remote user on the test device and talk to the remote user using your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.
</ProductWrapper>

<ProductWrapper product={["interactive-live-streaming", "broadcast-streaming"]}>
6. Now, you can see yourself on the test device as you have successfully joined the channel as a **Host**.

8.  To join the channel as **Audience**, edit the `AgoraClient` object and add a `clientRole` in the `AgoraChannelData` class:

    ```dart
    final AgoraClient client = AgoraClient(
        agoraConnectionData: AgoraConnectionData(
            appId: appId,
            channelName: channelName,
            tempToken: token,
            uid: uid,
        ),
        agoraChannelData: AgoraChannelData(
            channelProfile: ChannelProfile.LiveBroadcasting,
            clientRole: ClientRole.Audience,
        ),
    );
    ```

9.  Relaunch the app. Now you have joined the channel as **Audience** and you see only the host stream.
