1. **Import the required modules**

   In `preload.js`, add the following before `createAgoraRtcEngine,`:

   ```javascript
   AreaCode,
   ```

2. **Implement the geofencing logic**

   To enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, set `areaCode` property in the `initialize` method to a <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region. In `preload.js`, replace `agoraEngine.initialize({appId: appID,});` with the following code:
   
   ```javascript
   // Your app will only connect to the Agora SD-RTN located in North America.
   agoraEngine.initialize(
    {
        appId: appID,
        areaCode: AreaCode.AreaCodeNa
    });
    ```
   If your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> fails to connect to the specified region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />, instead of connection to another <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region, <Vpd k="SDK" /> throws an error. If a firewall is deployed in your network environment, ensure that you:

    * Whitelist certain domains
    * Allow all IP addresses 
    * Open the firewall ports defined in <Link to="../reference/cloud-proxy-allowed-ips">Use Cloud Proxy</Link>.
