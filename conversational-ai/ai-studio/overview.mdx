  Build and manage intelligent conversational AI agents.
---

Convo AI Studio is a visual interface in the Agora Console that enables you to create, configure, and deploy conversational AI agents without writing code. You can build agent pipelines with your preferred LLM, ASR, and TTS providers, test agent behavior in real-time, and deploy to production environments with built-in telephony support.

Studio simplifies agent management by providing a centralized workspace to manage credentials, configure agent behavior, and monitor deployments. Whether you're building voice agents for customer support or creating outbound calling campaigns, Studio streamlines the development process from concept to production.

## Key benefits

- **Visual configuration management**: Switch between ASR, LLM, and TTS providers and customize key parameters through an intuitive interface without managing API calls directly.

- **Cloud-based storage**: Your pipeline configurations and credentials are securely stored in your Agora account and can be reused across multiple agents, eliminating the need to reconfigure settings for each deployment.

- **Simplified workflow**: Studio handles the complexity of integrating multiple AI services, allowing you to focus on agent behavior and user experience rather than API integration details.

## Key concepts

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a reusable agent configuration template that defines how your conversational AI agent processes interactions. Each pipeline specifies the ASR provider for speech recognition, the LLM provider for conversation logic, and the TTS provider for voice synthesis. You can configure key parameters for each provider through the Studio interface.

Studio provides templates to help you get started quickly. Once created, you can use a single pipeline to create multiple agent deployments across different Agora projects.

### Agents

An agent is a deployed instance created from a pipeline. When you deploy an agent, it uses the configuration defined in its source pipeline to handle conversations. You can deploy the same pipeline to multiple Agora projects, with each deployment operating independently.

### My Resources

My Resources is your centralized credential management system within Studio. Here you can securely store and manage API keys and region settings for your LLM, ASR, and TTS providers. Credentials saved in My Resources are stored in your Agora account and can be reused across all your pipelines, making it easy to update provider settings without reconfiguring individual agents.

## Convo AI Studio workflow

A typical workflow in Convo AI Studio follows these steps:

**Set up credentials**: Add your LLM, ASR, and TTS provider credentials to My Resources. This one-time setup allows you to reuse these credentials across all your pipelines.

**Create a pipeline**: Start from a template or create a custom pipeline by selecting your preferred providers and configuring key parameters such as voice characteristics, language models, and speech recognition settings.

**Test your pipeline**: Use the built-in test interface to interact with your pipeline and verify that ASR, LLM, and TTS components work correctly together. Review conversation transcripts to refine system prompts and greeting messages.

**Deploy your agent**: Deploy your pipeline to one or more Agora projects. Configure deployment settings including project selection and review billing estimates for ASR, LLM, TTS, and agent hosting.

**Connect your agent**: Integrate your deployed agent with applications using the Conversational AI Engine REST API. Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications about call events.

**Set up telephony** (optional): For voice calling use cases, import phone numbers from Twilio SIP trunk and create outbound calling campaigns with custom contact lists.

## Studio capabilities

Convo AI Studio provides comprehensive tools for building and managing conversational AI agents:

- **Pipeline management**: Create pipelines from templates, configure provider settings, and test agent behavior before deployment
- **Credential management**: Securely store and reuse API keys and region settings for all supported providers
- **Agent testing**: Test agent behavior in real-time with conversation transcripts and built-in debugging tools
- **Deployment management**: Deploy agents to multiple Agora projects and manage deployment status (active, paused)
- **API integration**: Trigger agent calls programmatically and receive webhook notifications for call events
- **Telephony integration**: Import phone numbers from Twilio SIP trunk and create outbound calling campaigns
- **Call history and analytics**: Track call outcomes, review transcripts, and analyze campaign performance

## Prerequisites

- An active Agora account with Console access
- An Agora project with Conversational AI enabled
- API credentials for your chosen providers (LLM, ASR, TTS)
- For telephony features: A Twilio account with Elastic SIP Trunk configured and phone numbers

## Who should use Studio

Convo AI Studio is designed for developers and technical users who want to configure and fine-tune conversational AI agents without managing API integrations directly. While Studio focuses on key configuration parameters rather than exposing all API-supported options, it provides enough flexibility to customize agent behavior for most use cases.

If you need access to advanced API parameters not available in Studio, you can use the Conversational AI Engine API for full programmatic control.
