3.  In Visual Studio, in `AgoraImplementation.h`, update `appId`, `channelName` and `token` with the values for your temporary token.

4. In Visual Studio, click **Local Windows Debugger**. A moment later, you see the app running on your development device.

    If this is the first time you run your app, grant camera and microphone permissions.

5. Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.

6. **Test volume control**

    1. Speak into your development device as you move the slider on the slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    1. Tap **Mute** while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app.
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your development device.

    1. To test other volume control methods, in `AgoraImplementationDlg.cpp`, replace the `adjustRecordingSignalVolume` call in `OnNMCustomdrawSlider2` with one of the following:

        ```cpp
        agoraEngine->adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(value);
        agoraEngine->adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUId,value);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingVolume(value);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(value);
        agoraEngine->adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(value);
        agoraEngine->setInEarMonitoringVolume(value);
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    1. To test other mute methods, in `AgoraImplementationDlg.cpp`, replace the `muteRemoteAudioStream` call in `OnBnClickedCheck1` with one of the following:

        ```cpp
        agoraEngine->muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isChecked);
        agoraEngine->muteLocalAudioStream(isChecked);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap the `CheckBox` to test the effect of these mute methods.
