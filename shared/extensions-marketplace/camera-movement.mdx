The <Vg k="RTEE_CM"/> extension enhances user experience by providing rhythmic and immersive interactions through dynamic camera movements.

## Applicable use-cases

<Vg k="RTEE_CM"/> can be flexibly used in the following use-cases:

- **Live entertainment broadcasts**: Highlight the host's unique style and expressions with various camera rhythm modes.
- **Meetings and education**: Use portrait lock mode to keep the focus on the key presenter with intelligent tracking and lens adjustments, enhancing professionalism and interactivity.

## Understand the tech

The <Vg k="RTEE_CM"/> extension includes the following functions:

| Function               | Description    |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Portrait lock mode     | Utilizes the face recognition technology to track and lock onto the portrait subject in real time, keeping them centered in the frame and preventing deviations that could impact the interactive experience. |
| Heartbeat mode         | An intelligent algorithm simulates the rhythm of a human heartbeat and integrates it into the video, making scene transitions more dynamic. |
| Portrait light and shadow mode | Displays a virtual image behind the host to create unique light and shadow effects, making the host's performance more striking.|
| Up and down rhythm     | Provides more freedom and flexibility for camera movements through different rhythmic modes, presenting diverse perspectives and offering a wider interactive space.|
| Left and right rhythm  | Provides more freedom and flexibility for camera movements through different rhythmic modes, presenting diverse perspectives and offering a wider interactive space. |
| Back and forth rhythm  | Provides more freedom and flexibility for camera movements through different rhythmic modes, presenting diverse perspectives and offering a wider interactive space. |

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure, you must have:

- Integrated the v4.2.x or v4.3.x of the Video SDK and implemented basic real-time audio and video functions in your app. See [SDK quickstart](/realtime-communication/get-started/get-started-sdk).

    <Admonition type="info" info="Note"><ul><li>When integrating through Maven Central, specify `io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:x.y.z` and replace `x.y.z` with the specific SDK version number.</li><li>The MetaKit extension uses the Face Capture extension ( `libagora_face_capture_extension.so`) and the Virtual Background extension (`libagora_segmentation_extension.so`). You can delete unnecessary extensions as needed to reduce the size of the app.</li></ul></Admonition>
