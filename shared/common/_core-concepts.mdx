Before you start writing your code, familiarize yourself with the core concepts that <Vg k="COMPANY" /> SDKs are built on.

## <Vg k="CONSOLE" />

[<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/) is the main dashboard where you manage your <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services. <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> provides an intuitive interface for developers to query and manage their <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account. After [registering an <Vg k="COMPANY" /> account](https://console.agora.io/en/signup), you use the console to perform the following tasks:

-   Manage the account

-   Create and configure <Vg k="COMPANY" /> projects and services

-   Get an App ID

-   Manage members and roles

-   Check call quality and usage

-   Check bills and make payments

-   Access product resources

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> also provides RESTful APIs that you use to implement features such as creating a project and fetching usage numbers programmatically.

## App ID

The App ID is a random string generated within [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/) when you create a new project. You can create multiple projects in your account; each project has a different App ID. This App ID enables your app users to communicate securely with each other. When you initialize <Vg k="ENGINE" /> in your app, you pass the App ID as an argument. The App ID is also used to create the authentication tokens that ensure secure communication in a channel. You [retrieve your App ID](https://console.agora.io/projects) using <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses this App ID to identify each app, provide billing and other statistical data services.

<div class="warning">

    For applications requiring high security in a production environment, you must choose a App ID + Token mechanism for [user authentication](../develop/authentication-workflow) when creating a new project. Without an authentication token, your environment is open to anyone with access to your App ID.

## App certificate

An App certificate is a string generated by <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to enable token authentication. It is required for generating an RTC or RTM authentication token. To get your app certificate from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />, see [Manage app certificates](../reference/manage-agora-account#get-the-app-certificate). To use your App certificate for setting up a token server, see [Create and run a token server.](../develop/authentication-workflow#create-and-run-a-token-server)

## Token

A token is a dynamic key that is used by the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> authentication server to check user permissions. You use <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> to generate a temporary token for testing purposes during the development process. In a production environment, you implement a token server in your security infrastructure to control access to your channels. For more information, see [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](../develop/authentication-workflow).

## Channel

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses the *channel name* to identify a channel. Users who specify the same *channel name* join a common channel and interact with each other. A channel is created when the first user joins. It ceases to exist when the last user leaves.

You create a channel by calling the methods for transmitting real-time data. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> uses different channels to transmit different types of data. The RTC channel transmits audio or video data, while the RTM channel transmits messaging or signaling data. The RTC and RTM channels are independent of each other.

Additional components provided by <Vg k="COMPANY" />, such as On-premise Recording and Cloud Recording, join the RTC channel and provide real-time recording, transmission acceleration, media playback, and content moderation.

## Channel profile

The SDK applies different optimization methods according to the selected channel profile. <Vg k="COMPANY" /> supports the following channel profiles:

| Channel profile    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COMMUNICATION      | This profile is suitable for one-on-one or group calls, where all users in the channel talk freely.                                                                                                                  |
| LIVE\_BROADCASTING | In a live streaming channel, users have two client roles: *host* and *audience*. The *host* sends and receives audio or video, while the *audience* only receives audio or video with the sending function disabled. |

## User ID

A user ID (UID) identifies a user in a channel. Each user in a channel should have a unique user ID. If you do not specify a user ID when the user joins a channel, a UID is automatically generated and assigned to the user.

## Stream

A stream is a sequence of digitally-encoded coherent signals that contains audio or video data. Users in a channel [publish](#publish) local streams and [subscribe](#subscribe) to remote streams from other users.

#### Publish

Publishing is the act of sending a user’s audio or video data to the channel. Usually, the published stream is created by the audio data sampled from a microphone or the video data captured by a camera. You can also publish media streams from other sources, such as an online music file or the user’s screen.
After successfully publishing a stream, the SDK continues sending media data to other users in the channel. By publishing the local stream and subscribing to remote streams, users communicate with each other in real-time.

#### Subscribe

Subscribing is the act of receiving media streams published by remote users to the channel. A user receives audio and video data from other users by subscribing to one or more of their streams. You either directly play the subscribed streams or process incoming data for other purposes such as recording or capturing screenshots.
