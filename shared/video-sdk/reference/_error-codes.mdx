When interacting with the Agora API, the <Vpd k="SDK" /> may return an error code. Receiving an error code indicates that the SDK has encountered an unrecoverable error that necessitates intervention from your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

This page provides descriptions for common error codes along with the associated reasons and their corresponding solutions. For error codes without predefined solutions, [contact technical support](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) for assistance.

The error codes listed in this section apply to Agora RTC v4.x SDK on the following platforms:

- Native platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows.
- Third-party frameworks (that is, third-party platforms based on native platform encapsulation): Electron, Unity, React Native, Flutter.
</PlatformWrapper>

During the operation of Agora SDK, error codes may be returned in the following ways:

<PlatformWrapper platform="web">
- For asynchronous methods, the SDK returns a Promise to notify the result of the asynchronous operation, and the SDK throws the appropriate error code when the Promise is rejected.
- When a synchronous method call fails, the SDK throws an error code directly.
  The SDK may also throw some network related error codes during internal operation.

The SDK's error object `AgoraRTCError` inherits from the browser's [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object. Print out the error code on the console via `AgoraRTCError.code` since directly printing the `AgoraRTCError` object will only show the error message.
</PlatformWrapper>

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="web">
- In the return value of a failed method call.
- Through the `onError` callback.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information">
- When the SDK returns an error code, it may return a negative number. This negative number corresponds to the positive integer in the error code. For example, if it returns `-2`, it corresponds to `2` in the error code.
- The API names in this article are based on the C++ API. The API names for other platforms may be different. Please refer to the API documentation for the corresponding platform.
