Agora Real-Time Speech-To-Text (STT) enables you to transcribe the voice stream of each host to provide live closed captions (CC) and transcription for improved accessibility. Using its advanced features, you can also remove silent audio segments to optimize transcription performance and reduce costs. The output text can be further processed as input for large language models, such as GPT. Real-Time STT serves as a gateway for real-time engagement to enter the AI arena.
