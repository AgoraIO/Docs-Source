### Test channel media Relay

1. In `main.js`, update `appID`, `channel` and `destChannelName`.

2. In `main.js`, set `uid` to a non-zero unsigned 32-bit integer.

3. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vpl k="CONSOLE" /> using `appID` and `channel`. Use it to update `token` in `main.js`.

4. Generate a third token in <Vpl k="CONSOLE" /> using `appID` and `destChannelName`. Use it to update `destChannelToken` in `main.js`.

5. In your browser, navigate to the [<Vg k="COMPANY"/> web demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/) and fill in `appID`, `channel`, and `token`, then click **Join*
*.

6. Repeat the previous step on a second device, but this time use `appID`, `destChannelName`, and `destChannelToken` to **Join** the channel.

7. Start the dev server:

    Execute the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Use the URL displayed in the terminal to open the <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> in your browser.

8 Select **Host**.

9. To connect to a channel, click **Join**.

    If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. You see the web browser demo app connected to `channel` shows the video from your development device.

10. Press **Start Channel Media Relay**. You see the video from the web browser demo app connected to `channel` relayed to the web browser demo app connected to `destChannelName`.

11. Press **Stop Channel Media Relay**. The media relaying is stopped.
