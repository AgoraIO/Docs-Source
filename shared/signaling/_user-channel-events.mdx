<div class="alert note">For the user events and channel events RESTful API, the number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.</div>

## <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

The <Vg k="MESS" /> RESTful API only supports HTTPS.
You can use either of the following methods to authenticate your HTTP request: 

- [Basic authentication](#basicauth)
- [Token authentication](#tokenauth)

### <a name="basicauth"></a>Basic authentication

For basic HTTP authentication, you need to put `api_key:api_secret` in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header. For more information on how to generate the `Authorization` filed, see [RESTful API authentication](restful-authentication).

### <a name="tokenauth"></a>Token authentication

For token authentication, you need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` field and the `x-agora-uid` field when sending your HTTP request: 

- The <Vg k="MESS" /> Token generated at your server. 
- The uid you use to generate the <Vg k="MESS" /> Token. 

For more information on how to generate the `x-agora-token` field and the `x-agora-uid` field, see [RESTful API authentication](restful-authentication).

## API sequence


- Get user events: Call the [Gets user events API](#get_user).
- Get channel events: Call the [Gets channel events API](#get_channel).


## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Request: See the examples in the following APIs.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.
- Base URL: `https://api.agora.io/dev/v2/project/<appid>`

> Note: <code>&lt;appid&gt;</code> is the [App ID](manage-agora-account) used by your project. All the request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.


## <a name="get_user"></a>Gets user events (GET)

This method gets the user events from the address specified by the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> server. Events you acquired from this API are removed from the Agora <Vg k="MESS" /> server. You cannot get the same event twice.

> - The number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.
> - The <Vg k="MESS" /> backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events. If the number of events exceeds 2,000, the latest event replaces the oldest event.
> - The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time.
> - Agora does not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographical regions (countries or continents), because Agora stores events by geographical regions.
> - If you have pulled events from one geographical region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different geographical region. This is because Agora only synchronize events within a geographical region and does not synchronize events across geographical regions.
