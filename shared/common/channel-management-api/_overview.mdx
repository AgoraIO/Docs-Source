In addition to the SDK that you integrate into the app client, Agora provides a set of simple, secure, and reliable server-side RESTful APIs to manage real-time audio and video channels.

This page provides detailed documentation for the Agora Channel Management RESTful APIs.

### Key features and scenarios

| Key features | Description | Typical application scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| Manage user privileges | Includes removing specified users from channels and preventing them from sending audio and video streams. | <ul><li>Unauthorized users appear in a live broadcast.</li> <li>Users disrupt the room during a live broadcast.</li> <li>The signaling message sent to the client is hijacked.</li> <li>The user is offline abnormally, which interferes with timely user list updates.</li></ul> |
| Query channel information | Query the list of online channels, users in a channel, and the status of a specified user. | In a scenario where the number of concurrent channels is not large, directly query the channel list to sync the channel status. In a scenario where real-time sync performance is not required, query and sync the user list and status in the channel. |

### Authorization

<Authorization/>

### Domain

All requests are sent to the following domain name: `api.agora.io`. For example, after implementing basic HTTP authentication, add the following code to send a simple request to obtain the total number of channels and the number of users in each channel:

```java
public class Base64Encoding {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        // Customer ID
        // Set the AGORA_CUSTOMER_KEY environment variable
        final String customerKey = System.getenv("AGORA_CUSTOMER_KEY");
        // Customer key
        // Set the AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET environment variable
        final String customerSecret = System.getenv("AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET");

        // App ID
        // Set the AGORA_APP_ID variable
        final String appid = System.getenv("AGORA_APP_ID");

        // Concatenate the customer ID and customer secret and encode them using base64
        String plainCredentials = customerKey + ":" + customerSecret;
        String base64Credentials = new String(Base64.getEncoder().encode(plainCredentials.getBytes()));
        // Create the authorization header
        String authorizationHeader = "Basic " + base64Credentials

        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        // Create an HTTP request object
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
               .uri(URI.create("http://api.sd-rtn.com/dev/v1/channel/" + appid))
               .GET()
               .header("Authorization", authorizationHeader)
               .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
               .build();
        // Send an HTTP request
        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request,
                HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

        System.out.println(response.body());
        // Add the subsequent processing logic for the response content
   }
}
```

Use the channel management RESTful API along with the [<Vg k="NCS_LONG" />](../core-functionality/receive-notifications) service for reliable and effective channel management and status synchronization.

### Call frequency limit

For each Agora account (not each App ID), the maximum call frequency of every online channel statistics query API is 20 queries per second. The maximum call frequency of every other API is 10 queries per second. If you are frequency limited when calling the APIs, see [How can I avoid being frequency limited when calling Agora Server RESTful APIs](/help/integration-issues/restful_api_call_frequency/) to optimize API call frequency.

### Response status codes

For a description of the response status codes, refer to [Response status codes](response-status-code).
