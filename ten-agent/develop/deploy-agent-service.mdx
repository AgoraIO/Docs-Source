  Deploy your customized agent by creating a release docker image.
---

After customizing your agent through the playground or by editing `property.json` directly, you can deploy it as a production service. This guide walks you through creating a release Docker image and running your agent service.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- Completed agent configuration
- Docker installed on your deployment machine
- Access to your `.env` file with required API keys

## Build the Docker image

Create a production-ready Docker image of your agent service using the provided Dockerfile in the project root.

### Standard build

Build the default agent configuration:

```bash
docker build -t ten-agent-server .
```

For Apple Silicon machines, specify the platform:

```bash
docker build -t ten-agent-server . --platform linux/amd64
```

### Custom agent builds

To build specific agent configurations like demo or experimental versions, use the optional `USE_AGENT` build argument:

```bash
docker build --build-arg USE_AGENT=agents/examples/demo -t ten-agent-server .
```

```bash
docker build --build-arg USE_AGENT=agents/examples/experimental -t ten-agent-server .
```

## Run the service

Launch your agent service container with the necessary configuration:

```shell
docker run -itd -p 8083:8080 --env-file .env --name ten-agent-server ten-agent-server
```

Your agent service is accessible on port 8083.

## Test the deployment

Verify your deployment is working correctly using the following methods.

### API testing

The service exposes REST APIs for agent interaction. Find the complete API reference at [TEN Agent Server Documentation](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/tree/main/ai_agents/server).

### Playground testing

Test your deployed service using the playground client:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_GRAPH_MODE=false AGENT_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8083 pnpm dev
```

<Admonition type="info">
- Set `AGENT_SERVER_URL` to your service location. Replace `localhost` with your server IP for remote deployments.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_GRAPH_MODE` to `false` since the production image doesn't include the development server.

## Deploy with playground UI
For a complete deployment including the playground interface, follow these additional steps.

### Build playground image
Navigate to the playground directory and build the UI image:

```bash
cd playground
docker build --build-arg EDIT_GRAPH_MODE=false -t ten-agent-playground .
```

### Run playground container

Launch the playground container configured to connect to your agent service:

```bash
docker run -itd -p 4000:3000 -e AGENT_SERVER_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8083 --name ten-agent-playground ten-agent-playground
```

<Admonition type="info">
- Use `host.docker.internal` when the agent service runs in another Docker container on the same machine.
- For remote deployments, replace with your server's IP address.
- Always set `EDIT_GRAPH_MODE` to `false` for production deployments.
