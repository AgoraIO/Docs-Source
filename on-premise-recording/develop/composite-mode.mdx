import Implementation from '@docs/shared/on-premise-recording/develop/composite-recording/index.mdx';

The On-Premise Recording SDK supports two recording modes:

- Individual recording mode: This is the default recording mode. The SDK generates one audio and/or video file for each UID. 
- Composite recording mode: Generates a single mixed audio and video file for all UIDs in a channel, or mixes the audio of all UIDs in the channel into an audio file and the video of all UIDs into a video file.

See [Differences between individual recording mode and composite recording mode](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/recording_mode) to decide which mode you should use.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, follow the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/) guide to integrate the Recording SDK and implement the basic recording functionality.

## Implement Composite Recording

The implementation steps for the individual recording mode and the composite recording mode are largely the same as those in the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/) guide. The main differences lie in the configuration parameters and the APIs used in each mode.

Refer to the following call sequence diagram to implement the composite recording mode in your app:

To implement the composite recording mode in your app, take the following steps:

## Considerations

The composite recording mode supports a specific set of APIs. Calling unsupported methods in the wrong mode has no effect. When using the composite recording mode, the following methods do not work:

    * `setRecorderConfigByUid`
    * `enableAndUpdateVideoWatermarksByUid`
    * `startSingleRecordingByUid`
    * `stopSingleRecordingByUid`
