3. In _main.js_, update `appID`, `channel` and `token` with your values.

4. Start the dev server

6. To connect to a channel, click *Join*.
    
    If this is the first time you run the project, you need to grant microphone and camera access to your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

7. Try excluding a region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.
    
    In `main.js`, replace `AgoraRTC.setArea({ areaCode:"NORTH_AMERICA" })` with the following code:
    ```java
    // Exclude Mainland China from the regions for connection
    AgoraRTC.setArea({
        areaCode:"GLOBAL",
        excludedArea:"CHINA"
        })
    // You can use [] to exclude more than one region.
    ```
Now, you can see yourself and remote user on the device screen. It means your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> has made a connection with the specified region <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />.
