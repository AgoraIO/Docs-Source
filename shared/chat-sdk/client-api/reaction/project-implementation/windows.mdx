### Add a reaction

Call `AddReaction` to add a reaction to the specified message. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `MessageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (reaction ID, user ID of the user that adds the reaction, and the addition operation).

For a reaction, a user can add only once, or the error 1301 is reported for repeated addition.

```csharp
// Adds a reaction to the specified message
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.AddReaction(msg_id, reaction, new CallBack(
     onSuccess: () =>
     {
         Debug.Log($"AddReaction success.");
     },
     onError: (code, desc) =>
     {
         Debug.Log($"AddReaction failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
     }
));

// Listens for the reaction changes.
class ReactionManagerDelegate : IReactionManagerDelegate
{
    public void MessageReactionDidChange(List<MessageReactionChange> list)
    {
        if (list.Count == 0) return;
        foreach(var it in list)
        {
            // Add the iteration logic here.
        }
    }
}

// Adds a listener for the reaction.
ReactionManagerDelegate reactionManagerDelegate = new ReactionManagerDelegate();
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.AddReactionManagerDelegate(reactionManagerDelegate);
```

### Remove a reaction

Call `RemoveReaction` to remove the specified reaction. In a one-to-one conversation, the peer user receives the `MessageReactionDidChange` event. In a group conversation, other group members than the operator receive this event. This event contains the conversation ID, message ID, reaction list of the message, and reaction operation list (ID of the removed reaction, user ID of the user that removes the reaction, and the removal operation).

```csharp
// Removes the reaction.
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.RemoveReaction(msg_id, reaction, new CallBack(
     onSuccess: () =>
     {
         Debug.Log($"RemoveReaction success.");
     },
     onError: (code, desc) =>
     {
         Debug.Log($"RemoveReaction failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
     }
));

// Listens for the reaction changes.
class ReactionManagerDelegate : IReactionManagerDelegate
{
    public void MessageReactionDidChange(List<MessageReactionChange> list)
    {
        if (list.Count == 0) return;
        foreach(var it in list)
        {
            // Add the iteration logic here.
        }
    }
}

// Adds a listener for the reaction.
ReactionManagerDelegate reactionManagerDelegate = new ReactionManagerDelegate();
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.AddReactionManagerDelegate(reactionManagerDelegate);
```

### Retrieve a list of reactions

Call `GetReactionList` to retrieve a list of reactions of messages from the server. This method also returns the basic information of the reactions, including the content of the reaction, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and a list of the first three user IDs that added or removed the reaction.
```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetReactionList(messageIdList, chatType, groupId, new ValueCallBack<Dictionary<string, List<MessageReaction>>>(
onSuccess: (dict) =>
{
    // Iterates through the returned reaction dictionary.
    foreach (var it in dict)
    {
        // Iterates each list of reaction in the dictionary.
        List<MessageReaction> rl = it.Value;
        foreach (var lit in rl)
        {
            // Handles each reaction.
        }
    }
},
onError: (code, desc) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"GetReactionList failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
}
));
```

### Retrieve the details of the reaction

Call `GetReactionDetail` to get the detailed information of the reaction from the server. The detailed information includes the reaction content, the number of users that added or removed the reaction, and the complete list of user IDs that added or removed the reaction.

```csharp
SDKClient.Instance.ChatManager.GetReactionDetail(msg_id, reaction, cursor, pageSize, new ValueCallBack<CursorResult<MessageReaction>>(
onSuccess: (ret) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"GetReactionDetail success");
    if (ret.Data.Count > 0)
    {
        MessageReaction mr = ret.Data[0];
        // Handles the retrieved reaction.
    }
},
onError: (code, desc) =>
{
    Debug($"GetReactionDetail failed, code:{code}, desc:{desc}");
}
));
```
