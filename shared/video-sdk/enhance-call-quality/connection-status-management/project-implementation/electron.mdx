When the connection status changes, <Vpd k="SDK" /> triggers the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback. This section describes how to use the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback to monitor changes in a channel's connection state.

In your project, open the file with the <Vg k="ENGINE" /> event handler, and add the `onConnectionStateChanged` callback to the `IRtcEngineEventHandler` instance initialization.

The `state` parameter in `onConnectionStateChanged` reports the current connection state. The `reason` parameter indicates why the connection state changed to help you troubleshoot your network. See [State description and troubleshooting](#state-description-and-troubleshooting).
