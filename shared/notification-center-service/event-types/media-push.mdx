   - The `Converter` contains the following fields:
      - `id`: String type field. The ID of the Converter. This is a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) generated by the Agora server to identify a created Converter.
      - `createTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s) when the Converter was created.
      - `updateTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s)  when the Converter configurationwas last updated.
      - `state`: String type field. The running status of the Converter. If `the state is `"running"`, the Converter is running properly, and streams are being pushed to the CDN.`
      - `rtmpUrl`: (Required) String type field. The CDN streaming address.
   - `lts`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurred on the Agora server.
   - `xRequestId`: String type field, which identifies the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) of this request. This is the same as the `X-Request-ID` field in the request header.
   - `fields`: String type field. For the field mask of JSON encoding, please refer to the[ Google protobuf FieldMask document](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#fieldmask) for details. This is used to specify a subset of the`converter` field to be returned. In this example, `fields` specifies a subset of the `id`, `createTs`, `updateTs`, and `state` fields in the converter field returned by the Agora server.


### Converter status changed

<Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> notifies your server of this event when you have created a Converter and the running state of the Converter changes.

The `eventType` is `3(ConverterStateChangedEvent)`. The following is an example `payload`:

```json
{
    "converter": {
        "id": "4c014467d647bb87b60b719f6fa57686",
        "createTs": 1603456600,
        "updateTs": 1603456600,
        "state": "running"
    },
    "lts": 1603456600,
    "fields": "id,createTs,updateTs,state"
}
```

   - `createTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s) when the Converter was created.
   - `updateTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s)  when the Converter configurationwas last updated.
   - `state`: String type field. The running status of the Converter.
      - `connecting`: The Converter is connecting to the Agora server.
      - `running`: The Converter is running properly, and streams are being pushed to the CDN.
      - `failed`: There is a failure in pushing streams to the CDN.
- `lts`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurred on the Agora server.
- `fields`: String type field.

### Converter destroyed

<Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> notifies your server of this event when a Converter is destroyed, and the streams being pushed to the CDN are stopped.

> For the destruction reason, see the` destroyReason` field.

The `eventType` is `4(ConverterDestroyedEvent)`. The following is an example `payload`:

```json
{
    "converter": {
        "id": "4c014467d647bb87b60b719f6fa57686",
        "name": "show68_vertical",
        "createTs": 1603456600,
        "updateTs": 1603456600
    },
    "lts": 1603456600,
    "destroyReason": "Delete Request",
    "fields": "id,name,createTs,updateTs"
}
```

- The `Converter` contains the following fields:
   - `id`: String type field. The ID of the Converter. This is a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) generated by the Agora server to identify a created Converter.
   - `name`: String type field. The name of the Converter.
   - `createTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s) when the Converter was created.
   - `updateTs`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (s)  when the Converter configurationwas last updated.
- `lts`: Number type field. The Unix timestamp (ms) when the event occurred on the Agora server.
- `destroyReason`: String type field, which shows the reason for the destruction of the Converter.
   - `Delete Request`: The Agora server receives your Delete request.
   - `Idle Timeout`: After the idle state exceeds the set idleTimeOut, all users of the corresponding media streams processed by the Converter leave the channel.
   - `Internal Error`: Errors related to the Agora server. For example, hardware failure.
- `fields`: String type field.
