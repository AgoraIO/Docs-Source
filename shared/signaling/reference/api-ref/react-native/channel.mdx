A channel is a management mechanism for data transmission in the RTM real-time network. Any user who subscribes to or joins a channel can receive messages and events transmitted in the channel within 100 milliseconds. RTM allows clients to subscribe to hundreds or even thousands of channels. Most RTM APIs perform sending, receiving, encryption, and other operations based on channels.

Based on Agora's capabilities, RTM channels are categorized into three types to match different application scenarios:

- Message Channel: Follows the industry-standard Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe) model. Channels do not need to be created in advance. You can send and receive messages in a channel by subscribing to it. There is no limit to the number of publishers and subscribers in a channel.
- User Channel: Enables point-to-point messaging based on the Pub/Sub model. Users do not need to subscribe to a channel. You can send a message by specifying the user ID, and receive messages by simply listening to the `message` event.
- Stream Channel: Follows a room-based observer pattern similar to that used in the industry. Users must create and join a channel before sending and receiving messages. Channels can contain multiple Topics, and messages are organized and managed through Topics.

### subscribe

#### Description

RTM provides capabilities for message, status, and event change notifications. By setting up event listeners, you can receive messages and events from the channels you have subscribed to. For how to add and configure event listeners, see the [Event Listener](configuration#event-listener) section.

By calling the `subscribe` method, the client can subscribe to a Message Channel and start receiving messages and event notifications from that channel. After the method is successfully called, users who subscribe to the channel and have enabled Presence event listening will receive a `presence` event of type `remoteJoinChannel`. See <a href="configuration#event-listener">Event Listener</a> for details.

### createStreamChannel

#### Description
