  TEN versioning requirements.
---

The TEN framework follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning specification.

## Package version information

Each TEN package must include a `version` field in its `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Dependency version requirements

<Admonition type="info">
If you don't specify a version requirement for a dependency, the system uses the latest version.

TEN packages are organized in the following directory structure:

```
└── ten_packages/
    ├── extension/
    ├── extension_group/
    ├── protocol/
    └── system/
```

These packages are distinguished by the `type` field in their `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "system" // "extension", "extension_group", "protocol"
}
```

Specify version requirements for dependencies in your package's `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime",
      "version": "1.0.1"
    },
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime_go",
      "version": "1.0.3"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "default_http_extension_cpp",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension_group",
      "name": "default_extension_group",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Version requirement syntax

A version requirements string can contain multiple requirements separated by commas. Each requirement supports these operators:

- `>`, `>=`, `=`: Specify a version range or exact version
- `~`: Specify a minimum version with limited flexibility
  - With major, minor, and patch specified: only patch-level changes are allowed
  - With only major and minor specified: only patch-level changes allowed
  - With only major specified: minor and patch-level changes allowed
- `^`: Allow SemVer-compatible updates
  - This operator is the default when no operator is specified
  - Updates are allowed as long as they don't change the leftmost non-zero number
  - Examples:
    - `^0.1.12` (same as `0.1.12`): can update to `0.1.13` but not `0.2.0`
    - `^1.0` (same as `1.0`): can update to `1.1` but not `2.0`

A versions specified as `0.0.x` is considered incompatible with any other version.
