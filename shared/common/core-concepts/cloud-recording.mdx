Agora <Vpd k="NAME" /> enables you to record video and voice calls or streams in the cloud for storage or on-demand viewing. <Vpd k="NAME" /> works with Realtime Communication.

This page introduces the key processes and concepts you need to know to use <Vpd k="NAME" />.

## General concepts
<Vg k="COMPANY" />  relies on the following fundamental concepts to enable seamless real-time communication:

<SD_RTN />
<AppId />
<AppCertificate />
<Token />
<Channel />
<UserId />
<Console />

## Cloud recording concepts

### Recording modes

Agora <Vpd k="NAME" /> supports three recording modes: 

- Individual recording
- Composite recording
- Web page recording

After the recording is complete, the recorded content is uploaded as a `TS` file to the third-party cloud storage you specified. An `M3U8` file is also generated to serve as an index for the corresponding `TS` file

The working principles of different recording modes and the types of files generated by <Vpd k="NAME" /> are as follows:

#### Individual recording

In individual recording, the recording service records the audio and video streams of each UID in the channel separately. After the recording is complete, the recording service generates the corresponding audio and video files for each UID.

For example, if there are 3 UIDs in the channel and each UID sends audio and video, then in the individual recording mode, 3 audio files and 3 video files are generated.

#### Composite recording 
In mixed recording, the recording service combines the audio and video of multiple UIDs in the channel into a single audio and video file.

For example, if there are 3 UIDs in the channel and each sends audio and video, the mixed recording mode generates one recording file that includes the audio and video of all UIDs.

#### Web page recording
In web page recording, the recording service combines the page content and audio of a specified web page into an audio and video file.

Web page recording is commonly used in the following use-cases:

- In online classrooms, to record the teacher and student audio and video along with courseware, whiteboard, and other visuals. 
- In video conferences, to capture participants' audio and video, as well as whiteboard, PPT, and other visuals.

### Transcoding and non-transcoding modes

In individual recording, audio transcoding and non-transcoding modes have different use cases and characteristics.

**Individual recording with transcoding**: This mode is used in use-cases where unified audio encoding parameters are needed to ensure consistent recording file formats and parameters for easier post-processing and playback. It is commonly used in cases requiring high compatibility and standardized output, such as wide player support and standardized storage.

**Individual recording without transcoding**: This mode is used when the original audio encoding parameters must be preserved to maintain the sound quality and performance. It is often used in use-cases with high demands for real-time performance and original sound quality, such as high-fidelity audio recording.

| Feature | Individual recording with transcoding | Individual recording without transcoding |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Transcoding  during audio encoding | Yes | Yes |
| Raw audio data | The sampling rate, number of channels, and bitrate are fixed at 48 kHz, mono, and 48 Kbps respectively. | The bitrate, sampling rate and number of channels are determined by the audio encoding parameters of the streaming end `AudioProfile`. |
| Audio encoding format	| LC-AAC | Determined by the configuration of the source end `AudioProfile` |
| Generated recording files | Each UID generates an audio file in `M3U8` format and multiple audio files in `TS` format. | Same as transcoding recording. If the user stops streaming using `muteLocalAudioStream` or `leaveChannel` audio recording stops immediately, and there is no 15 seconds of silent data. |
| Player compatibility | The recorded file can be played by any mainstream player that supports the HLS protocol. | The audio encoding format is determined by the configuration of the streaming end `AudioProfile`. Different audio encoding formats have different compatibility. |

### Delayed transcoding
Delayed transcoding is designed for audio-only recording use-cases. When you enable this mode, the recording service merges and transcodes the audio files of all users in the specified channel into an `MP3`, `M4A`, or `AAC` file within 24 hours after the recording ends (or up to 48 hours in special cases) and uploads it to the specified third-party cloud storage.

### Delayed audio mixing
Delayed audio mixing is used for individual audio recording use-cases. To obtain a mixed recording file of all users in the channel after recording, you enable the delayed audio mixing feature when starting individual audio recording without transcoding. Once enabled, the recording service merges and transcodes the audio files of all users in the specified channel into an `MP3`, `M4A`, or `AAC` file within 24 hours after the recording is complete (or up to 48 hours in special cases) and uploads it to the specified third-party cloud storage.

### Slicing
Slicing involves cutting audio and video data according to specific rules during the recording process to generate multiple recording files. After slicing, several slice files (such as `TS` or `WebM` files) are created, along with `M3U8` files that store the indexes of these slice files.
