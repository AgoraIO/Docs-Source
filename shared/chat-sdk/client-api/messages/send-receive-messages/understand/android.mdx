The Chat SDK uses the `ChatManager` class to send, receive, and withdraw messages.

The process of sending and receiving a message is as follows:

1. The message sender creates a text, file, or attachment message using the corresponding `create` method.
2. The message sender calls `sendMessage` to send the message.
3. The message recipient calls `addMessageListener` to listens for message events and receive the message in the `OnMessageReceived` callback.
