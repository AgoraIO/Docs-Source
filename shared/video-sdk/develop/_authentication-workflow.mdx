Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. {data.COMPANY} uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access {data.AGORA_BACKEND} to join {props.PRODUCT}. Each token is valid for a limited period and works only for a specific channel. For example, you cannot use the token generated for a channel called `AgoraChannel` to join the `AppTest` channel.

This page shows you how to quickly set up an authentication token server, retrieve a token from the server, and use it  to connect securely to a specific {props.PRODUCT} channel.

## Understand the tech

An authentication token is a dynamic key that is valid for a maximum of 24 hours. On request, a token server returns an authentication token that is valid to join a specific channel.

When users attempt to connect to an {data.COMPANY} channel from your {props.CLIENT}, your {props.CLIENT} retrieves a token from the token server in your security infrastructure. Your {props.CLIENT} then sends this token to {data.AGORA_BACKEND} for authentication. {data.AGORA_BACKEND} validates the token and reads the user and project information stored in the token. A token contains the following information:

- The {data.APP_ID_LINK} of your {data.COMPANY} project
- The {data.APP_CERTIFICATE_LINK} of your {data.COMPANY} project
- The channel name
- The user ID of the user to be authenticated (optional)
- The privilege of the user, either as a publisher or a subscriber
- The Unix timestamp showing when the token will expire

The following figure shows the call flow you need to implement to create step-up-authentication with {data.COMPANY} {props.PRODUCT}:

![token authentication flow](/images/others/authentication-logic.svg)


## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

- Implemented Get started with [{props.PRODUCT}](/get-started)

- Created a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate token authentication into your app, do the following:

- Open the [Get started](/understand/get-started)project you created.
- Log in to your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)account.

<ProjectSetup />


## Implement the authentication workflow

In the _Get Started_ project you implemented, the {props.CLIENT} uses an authentication token obtained manually from {data.CONSOLE} to join a channel. In a production environment, your {props.CLIENT} retrieves this token from a token server. This section shows you how to:

1. [Create and run a token server](#user-content-create-and-run-a-token-server)
2. [Retrieve and use tokens from a token server](#user-content-retrieve-and-use-tokens-from-a-token-server)


### Create and run a token server

This section shows you how to deploy a token server on Heroku.

1. [Click here and deploy a token server to Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service).
  Heroku retrieves the project code and necessary files from Github and takes you to a *Create New App* page. On this page, fill in the following information:

    1. `app-name`: A name for your token server, containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
    2. `APP_CERTIFICATE`: The {data.APP_CERTIFICATE_LINK} obtained from {data.COMPANY} Console
    3. `APP_ID`: The {data.APP_ID_LINK} obtained from {data.COMPANY} Console

2. Click *Deploy app*. Heroku configures and builds the token server.
  You see a message 'Your app was successfully deployed.'
3. Click *View*.
  Heroku opens the token server URL in your browser. The URL is of the form `<app-name>.herokuapp.com` where `<app-name>` is the name you chose for your token server.

  Don't worry if you see `404 page not found` in your browser. Follow the next steps and test your server.

4. Test your server
    1.Ping the server
      Load the following URL in a browser tab. Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your server.

      ```
      https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com/ping
      ```

      You see the following message in your browser

      ```json
      {"message":"pong"}
      ```

    2. Retrieve a token
      To retrieve an RTC token, send a request to the token server using a URL based on the [Token server GET request structure](#user-content-token-server-get-request-structure):

      ```
      /rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
      ```

      For example: `\https://my-token-server.herokuapp.com/rtc/MyChannel/1/uid/0/?expiry=300`

      Your token server returns the following JSON object to your browser:

      ```json
      {"rtcToken":"ThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleTokenThisIsAnExampleToken"}
      ```

To see how to create a token generator inside your IAM system, see [Integrate a token generator](`${props.PRODUCT}/develop/integrate-token-generation`).

### Retrieve and use tokens from a token server

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented {data.COMPANY} token authentication workflow in your app:

1. {data.TOKEN_GENERATE_LINK} in {data.CONSOLE}.
  Users communicate securely using channels in the same project. The _App ID_ you use to generate this token must be the same one you supplied to Heroku.

2. In your browser, navigate to the {data.DEMO_PAGE_LINK} and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click *Join*.

<ProjectTest />

Your {data.PLATFORM} {props.CLIENT} magically connects to the same channel you used in {data.DEMO_PAGE_LINK}. You don't have to hardcode a token in your app; each channel is secured with a specific token, and each token is refreshed automatically. That's pretty Cool!


## Reference

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.


### Source code for a token server

The token server RESTful web service used in this page is written in Golang using the Gin framework. Want to use the code in your authentication service? [Download](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/agora-token-service/releases/tag/v1.1.1) the token server source code and binaries for various platforms from Github.


### Token server GET request structure

A token server GET request has the following structure:

```html
/rtc/:channelName/:role/:tokentype/:uid/?expiry=expireTime
```

- `:channelName` is the name of the Agora Channel you wish to join
  A channel name may contain numbers with both upper and lower case letters. The name length must be less than 64 characters.

- `:role` is the user role
  Use `1` for Publisher, `2` for subscriber.

- `:tokentype` is the type of token
  {data.AGORA_BACKEND} supports both integer user Ids and string user accounts for token generation. To ensure smooth communication, all the users in a channel must use the same type of Id, that is, either the integer `uid`, or a string `userAccount`. Best practice is to use the `uid`.

- `:uid` is the user id
  User Id can be any 32-bit unsigned integer. It can be set to 0, if you do not need to authenticate the user.

- `expireTime` (optional) is the number of seconds after which the token will expire
  By default, a token expires after 24 hours unless a shorter life span is explicitly specified in the token request.
