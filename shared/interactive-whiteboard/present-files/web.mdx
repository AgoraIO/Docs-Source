## Insert Images

<Vg k="FAST" /> provides the [`insertImage`](../reference/uikit-sdk#insertimage) method for inserting and displaying an image in the main window of the whiteboard. You can call this method and pass in the URL of the image to display a specified image.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the image. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the image cannot be displayed properly.

- Make sure that the image is in PNG, JPG/JPEG, or WEBP format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement inserting an image in the [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Open the `main.js` file, and add the following after `mountFastboard(document.getElementById("app"));`:
    ``` javascript
        await app.insertImage(
            "https://web-cdn.agora.io/website-files/images/interactive-whiteboard-text-tab-1.png"
        );
    ```
2. Run the following command to run the project:
    ``` sh
        npm run dev
    ```
You can see the inserted image after the `index.html` page opens.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for `insertImage`. You need to implement the UI yourself.</div>

## Play audio and video

<Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the media player extension and provides the [`insertMedia`](../reference/uikit-sdk#insertmedia) method for playing audio and video files. You can simply call `insertMedia` and pass in the audio and video file name and URL to play the audio and video in a sub-window on the whiteboard.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Prepare the URL of the audio or video. Make sure that your app clients can access the URL; otherwise, the audio and video cannot be loaded properly.

- Make sure that the audio and video files are in MP3 or MP4 format.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement playing a video in the [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Open the `main.js` file, and add the following after `mountFastboard(document.getElementById("app"));`:
    ``` javascript
        await app.insertMedia(
            "test1.mp4",
            "https://beings.oss-cn-hxxxou.aliyuncs.com/test/aaa59xxxxxxxc695def4/1606277539701637%E7%9A%84%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC.mp4"
        );
    ```

2. Run the following command to run the project:

    ``` javascript
        npm run dev
    ```

You can see the sub-window named `test1.mp4` after the `index.html` page opens. Click the start button to play the video.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> does not provide a UI for insertMedia. You need to implement the UI yourself.</div>

## Present documents

<Vg k="FAST" /> integrates the docs viewer and slide extensions and provides the [`insertDocs`](../reference/uikit-sdk#insertdocs-12) method for presenting documents. You can simply call `insertDocs` and pass the parameters of a document to present the document in a paginated format in a sub-window on the whiteboard. The implementation workflow is as follows:

1. Call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#start-file-conversion) to convert the source document to a paginated set of images or web pages.

2. Call the [Query file conversion progress (GET) API](../develop/generate-token-rest#query-the-progress-of-a-file-conversion-task) to get the conversion result.

3. Call `insertDocs`, and pass the width, height, and URL of each image or web page in order in the scenes parameter.

When converting a source document to images or web pages, note the following:

- Ensure the format of the converted images or web pages is supported by <Vg k="FAST" />.

    <Vg k="FAST" /> supports inserting and displaying images or web pages in the following formats:

    - Static images in PNG, JPG/JPEG, and WEBP formats converted from PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF files. See [Static-file conversion service](../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#static-file-conversion).

    - HTML web pages converted from PPTX files. See [Dynamic-file conversion service](../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#dynamic-file-conversion).

- Ensure the converted images or web pages are accessible on the public network.

    In addition, if the server that stores the images or web pages has a different domain from that of your web application, you need to configure [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS); otherwise, your app clients might fail to access and load these images or web pages.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Integrate <Vg k="FAST" /> in your project, and join the room. See [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room).

- Complete file conversion, and generate a set of URLs for the converted images or web pages.

### Implementations

The following steps show how to implement presenting a three-page, animated PPTX file in the [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project:

1. Upload the PPTX source document to a third-party cloud storage service, and call the [Start file conversion (POST) API](../reference/whiteboard-api/file-conversion#start-file-conversion) to create a dynamic-file conversion task that converts the PPTX file to HTML web pages.

2. Call the [Query file conversion progress (GET) API](../develop/generate-token-rest#query-the-progress-of-a-file-conversion-task) to get the file conversion result.

3. Open the [Join the whiteboard room](../get-started/get-started-uikit#join-the-whiteboard-room) project, and add the following lines to the `main.js` file:
    ``` javascript
        // Pass the conversion result (the entire response body returned by the Query file conversion progress (GET) API) in the response parameter.
        var response = {
            "uuid": "01xxxx82",
            "type": "dynamic",
            "status": "Finished",
            "progress": {
                "totalPageSize": 3,
                "convertedPageSize": 3,
                "convertedPercentage": 100,
                "convertedFileList": [
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/1.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/1.png"
                    },
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/2.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/2.png"
                    },
                    {
                        "width": 1280,
                        "height": 720,
                        "conversionFileUrl": "pptx://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/3.slide",
                        "preview": "https://docs-test-ct.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dynamicConvert/01612xxx882/preview/3.png"
                    }
                ],
                "currentStep": "Packaging"
            }
        };

        // Call insertDocs to insert the doc.
        var btn = document.getElementById("addPPT");
        btn.onclick = async function addPPT() {
            await app.insertDocs("My PPT", response);
        };
    ```

4. Add the following code to the `index.html` file to load the button for displaying the document on the web page:
    ``` xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8" />
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
                <title>Vite App</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div
                        id="app"
                        style="width: 600px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid;"
                ></div>
                <!--Define the style of the button and add it to the web page-->
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                <div id="viewDocs" class="Prev" style="width: 50px; border: 1px solid; position: fixed; bottom: 430px; rightï¼š20px;">
                    Show My PPT
                </div>
            </div>
                <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
                </body>
            </html>
    ```
You can see the **Show My PPT** button when the `index.html` page opens. Click the button, and the SDK loads your document in a sub-window. Click the arrow to show your document page by page.

<div class = "alert info"><Vg k="FAST" /> also provides another insertDocs method for inserting and displaying documents. For details, see the <a href = "https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/whiteboard/fastboard_api_web?platform=Web#insertdocs-22">API reference</a>.</div>
