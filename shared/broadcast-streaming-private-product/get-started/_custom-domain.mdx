This page shows how to start Broadcast Streaming using a custom domain.

## Understand Broadcast Streaming modes <a name="mode"></a>
When using a custom domain, Broadcast Streaming provides two modes for you to build live streaming experiences:

|                     | Push CDN mode                                                | Pull CDN mode                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| How it works        | You push streams to the Broadcast Streaming servers, and the Broadcast Streaming servers deliver the content to your audience. | The Broadcast Streaming servers pull streams from your origin server and deliver the content to your audience. |
| Applicable use-case | No origin server is required                                 | An origin sever is required                                  |
| How to configure it | Go to Agora Console. See [Configure Push CDN mode](#push).                  | <li>If you use a relatively fixed domain name, add it on Agora Console. See [Configure Pull CDN mode](#pull). </li><li>If you needs more flexibility, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) and provide a URL address, so that Agora can send a request to get your domain name before pulling streams.</li> |

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
- [Enable Broadcast Streaming](enable-broadcast-streaming) in Agora Console.
- Decide an [Broadcast Streaming mode](#mode) according to your business use-case.

## Configure Broadcast Streaming modes

To configure your Broadcast Streaming mode, follow these steps:
1. Configure either Push CDN mode or Pull CDN mode in Agora Console.
2. Finish CNAME configuration.

### Configure Push CDN mode

Follow these steps to configure Push CDN mode:

4. Add a stream-pushing domain:
   1. Click **Add**.
   2. Fill in your domain name for stream pushing, and select a region from the dropdown menu.
   3. Click **Create**.
   By default, support for RTMPS is disabled, and the certificate and authentication information is blank. To edit these settings, click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637576898777" /> icon.
3. Add a playback domain:
   1. Click **Add**.
   1. Fill in your domain name for stream playback, and select a region from the dropdown menu.
   3. Click **Create**.
   By default, support for HTTPS and cross-domain configuration is disabled, and the certificate and authentication information is blank. To edit these settings, click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637576898777" /> icon.
3. (Optional) Add an SSL certificate:
   1. Click **Add**.
   1. Create a name for the certificate.
   2. Upload your certificate (`.pem` or `.crt`) and key (`.key`) files.
   2. Click **Save**.
4. (Optional) Configure the Agora Message Notification service for Broadcast Streaming events:
   1. Turn on the switch.
   1. Fill in your callback address to receive the message notifications.
   2. Click **Save**.
   2. Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable the Agora Message Notification service.

### Configure Pull CDN mode

Follow these steps to configure Pull CDN mode:

1. Click the **Config** button for **Fusion CDN** to enter the configuration page.
  ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1649664610876)
2. Click **Pull CDN** on the top of the page.
3. Add the source domain:
   1. Turn on the switch
   2. Fill in the domain name of your origin server.
   3. Click **Save**.
4. Add a playback domain:
   1. Click **Add**.
   2. Fill in your domain name for stream playback, and select a region from the dropdown menu.
   3. Click **Create**.
   By default, support for HTTPS and cross-domain configuration is disabled, and the certificate and authentication information is blank. To edit these settings, click the <img src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1637576898777" /> icon.
4. (Optional) Add an SSL certificate:
   1. Click **Add**.
   2. Create a name for the certificate.
   3. Upload your certificate (`.pem` or `.crt`) and key (`.key`) files.
   4. Click **Save**.

   1. Turn on the switch.
   2. Fill in your callback address to receive the message notifications.
   3. Click **Save**.
   4. Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable the Agora Message Notification service.

### Finish CNAME configuration

Once you add a stream-pushing or playback domain name when configuring Push CDN mode or Pull CDN mode, Agora automatically assigns it a CNAME ("canonical name") suffixed with `.v1.agoramdn.com`. To use your custom domain name for live streaming, you need to add its CNAME to your domain's DNS settings, so that your domain name points to the CNAME. For details, refer to your DNS provider's instructions.

## Implement Broadcast Streaming
### Step 1: Construct the URL for pushing a live stream

Agora supports both sRTMP and RTMPS. For details, see [Construct the URL for pushing a live stream](../develop/url-construction#construct-the-url-for-pushing-a-live-stream).

### Step 2: Push the live stream

To push an RTMP/RTMPS stream, you can choose one of the following methods:

- Use streaming software, such as OBS. See [Streaming Software Configuration](../develop/streaming-software-configuration).
- Use the Media Push RESTful API to convert live streams within an Agora channel to an RTMP/RTMPS stream. See [Media Push RESTful API Reference](/media-push/develop/restful-api).

### Step 3: Construct the URL for playing the live stream

Agora supports RTMP, HTTP-FLV, and HLS. For details, see [Construct the URL for playing a live stream](../develop/url-construction#construct-the-url-for-pushing-a-live-stream).

<div class="alert note">To get a playback URL that supports HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

### Step 4: Play the live stream

Use the [Agora MediaPlayer Kit](https://docs-preprod.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/mediaplayer_special_quickstart_android) or your own player to play the live stream.

## Next steps

After implementing Broadcast Streaming, you can add the following live streaming functions through the Broadcast Streaming RESTful API:

- [Stream pushing/playing authentication](../restful-api/stream-authentication)
- [Transcoding](../restful-api/transcoding/standard)
- [Snapshot and content moderation](../restful-api/snapshot-moderation/custom)
- [Stream management](../restful-api/stream-management)
- Message notification (coming soon)
- Recording (coming soon)
