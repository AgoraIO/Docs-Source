This page explains how <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your monthly bill for <Vg k="SIG"/>.

## How <Vg k="SIG" /> usage is measured

<Vg k="SIG" /> is priced based on the following metrics:

- **Message volume**: The total number of messages sent and received by all users in a calendar month.
- **Storage utilization**: The average amount of data, measured in GB, stored on Agora's servers over the billing cycle.
- **Peak Concurrent Users (PCU)**: The maximum number of simultaneous users connected to your Signaling service at any point during the billing cycle.

The following are key terms you need to understand pricing:

- **Overage**: Usage that exceeds the limits included in your fixed-rate plan is billed at the standard consumption rates.
- **Normalization**: The process of standardizing billing calculations to 30-day months (720 hours), regardless of the actual number of calendar days, to ensure consistent month-to-month billing.

### Billing examples

Refer to the following examples to understand how <Vg k="COMPANY" /> calculates your bill:

<details>
<summary>Example 1: Billing calculation for the Pro package</summary>

The Pro package has a fixed monthly fee of $399, which includes:

- Up to 2,500 peak concurrent users (PCU)
- Up to 150 million monthly messages
- Up to 10GB average storage utilization. See [Example 3: Storage cost calculation](#storage-cost) for details on how storage use is calculated.

If your usage stays within these thresholds, your monthly bill is the base subscription fee of $399 with no additional charges.

If you exceed these limits, additional usage is charged at the following overage rates:

| Resource              | Billing Unit            | Rate   |
|:----------------------|:------------------------|-------:|
| Peak Concurrent Users | 1,000 PCU               | $30.00 |
| Message Volume        | 1 Million messages      | $3.00  |
| Storage               | 1 GB                    | $15.00 |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 2: Billing calculation for the Enterprise Package (Pay-as-you-go)</summary>

The Enterprise Package follows a pure consumption-based model where you pay only
for what you use.

Example Scenario: Consider a customer with the following monthly usage:

- 20,000 peak concurrent users
- 800 million messages sent
- 3.93 GB average storage utilization. See [Example 3: Storage cost calculation](#storage-cost) for details on how storage use is calculated.

Detailed Billing Calculation:

1. Peak Concurrent Users (PCU)
    - PCU Usage: 20,000 users (highest recorded in the month)
    - PCU Rate: $30.00 per 1,000 PCU
    - PCU Cost = (20,000 ÷ 1,000) × $30.00 = $600.00

2. Message Volume
    - Total Messages: 800 million
    - Message Rate: $3.00 per million messages
    - Message Cost = 800 × $3.00 = $2,400.00

3. Storage Utilization
    - Average Monthly Storage: 3.93 GB
    - Storage Rate: $15.00 per GB per month
    - Storage Cost = 3.93 GB × $15.00 = $58.95

4. Total Monthly Invoice
    - Total Monthly Cost = PCU Cost + Message Cost + Storage Cost
        - = $600.00 + $2,400.00 + $58.95
        - = $3,058.95
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 3: Storage cost calculation</summary>
<a id="storage-cost"></a>

Storage is billed based on the average monthly utilization, calculated from hourly measurements.

Storage Calculation Process:
- **Hourly measurement**: Agora captures storage utilization every hour.
- **Monthly normalization**: For billing consistency, all months are normalized to 30 days (720 hours).

**Example**: For usage in March (a 31-day month):
- Week 1: 2 GB baseline storage
- Weeks 2-3: 6 GB during high usage period
- Week 4+: 2 GB returning to baseline

**Calculation**:
- Week 1 (7 days): 2 GB × (7 days × 24 hours) = 336 GB-hours
- Weeks 2-3 (14 days): 6 GB × (14 days × 24 hours) = 2,016 GB-hours
- Week 4+ (10 days): 2 GB × (10 days × 24 hours) = 480 GB-hours

Total GB-hours: 336 + 2,016 + 480 = 2,832 GB-hours

Normalized Monthly Average: 2,832 GB-hours ÷ 720 hours (Normalization) = 3.93 GB.

Normalization is the process of standardizing billing calculations to 30-day months (720 hours) regardless of actual calendar days which is 31 in this example.

Storage Cost = 3.93 GB × $15.00 per GB = $58.95
