<Vpd k="NAME" /> lets you intercept remote video frames during real-time interaction to review live broadcast content and ensure compliance with regulations.

This article shows you how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement the screenshot feature in your project.

## Understand the tech

The <Vpd k="SDK" /> supports capturing screenshots of remote video in both individual and composite recording modes. You can also take screenshots without recording. The supported formats are:

- H.264/H.265 encoded frame: Returns video frame data in the original encoding format
- YUV frame: Returns video frame data in YUV format
- JPG frame: Returns video frame data in JPG format
- JPG file: Saves the screenshot as a JPG file in the specified directory

## Prerequisites

Before using layouts, complete the steps in the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/quickstart) guide to integrate the SDK and set up basic recording.
