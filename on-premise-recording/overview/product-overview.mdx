The Agora Local Server Recording SDK is a recording component developed by Agora for audio and video calls and live broadcasts. Through simple operation methods, it helps developers quickly and flexibly deploy recording services to record audio and video calls or live broadcasts and generate recording files in MP4 format.

With the recording function, you can save the content of voice chat, video chat and live broadcast, and provide it to more people for viewing at a convenient time. For example, users can watch course recordings at convenient times for review or make-up lessons after attending live online courses.

The SDK works with <Vg k="AUDIO" />, <Vg k="VIDEO" />, <Vg k="BS" /> and <Vg k="ILS" />, and is compatible with the Agora RTC Native and Framework SDK (version 1.7.0 or higher) and the Agora RTC Web SDK (version 1.12.0 or higher).
