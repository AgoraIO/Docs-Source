<Vg k="WHITE" /> rooms enable users to present ideas, share multi-media content, and collaborate on projects on a shared whiteboard from multiple devices simultaneously.

This article shows you the minimal code to join an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room and implement basic whiteboard features.

## Understand the tech
The following figure shows the workflow to join an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1620443996218)

When an app client requests to join an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room, the app client and your app server interact with the <Vg k="WHITE" /> server in the following steps：
1. The app server sends a request with the SDK token to the <Vg k="WHITE" /> server to create a whiteboard room.
2. The <Vg k="WHITE" /> server returns the room UUID to the app server when a room is created successfully.
3. The app server generates a room token using the returned room UUID and sends the room token and UUID to the app client.
4. The app client initializes a <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> instance with the App Identifier received from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />.
5. The app client calls a method to join the <Vg k="WHITE" /> room using the room UUID and room token.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you must have the following:

- A web browser that meets the minimum version requirements in [Supported platforms](../reference/supported-platforms).
- A valid [Agora account](../reference/manage-agora-account#sign-up-and-log-in).
- An Agora project with the <Vg k="WHITE" /> enabled. Get the app identifier and SDK token from the <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. See [Enable and configure <Vg k="WHITE" />](../develop/enable-whiteboard).

## Create a basic web application

Follow the steps to create a minimal web application that has the following structure:

```
agora_join_whiteboard_room/
├── index.html
└── joinWhiteboard.js
```

1. Create a new folder called `agora_join_whiteboard_room`.
2. In `agora_join_whiteboard_room`, create the following files:
   - `index.html`: The visual user interface.
   - `joinWhiteboard.js`: The programmable interface that uses `WhiteWebSdk` to implement the app logic.

3. In `index.html`, add the following code to include the app logic in the UI:

   ``` xml
   <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <script src="./joinWhiteboard.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="whiteboard" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh;"></div>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

After setting up the basic structure, you can now build the whiteboard functionality into the application.

## Create an <Vg k="WHITE" /> room from your app server

Before an app client requests to join a room, you need to call [/v5/rooms (POST)](../reference/whiteboard-api/room-management#create-a-room-post) on your app server to create a room.

You can use the following Node.js script as a request example:

```javascript
var request = require("request");
var options = {
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.netless.link/v5/rooms",
  "headers": {
  "token": "Your SDK Token",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "region": "us-sv"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "isRecord": false
  })
};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

If the request is successful, Agora's server for the <Vg k="WHITE" /> returns information about the created room, including the `uuid`, which is the unique identifier of the room. You need to pass in this parameter when an app client joins the room.

The following is a response example:

```json
{
    "uuid": "4a50xxxxxx796b", // The room UUID
    "teamUUID": "RMmLxxxxxx15aw",
    "appUUID": "i54xxxxxx1AQ",
    "isBan": false,
    "createdAt": "2021-01-18T06:56:29.432Z",
    "limit": 0
}
```

## Generate a room token
After creating a room and getting the `uuid` of the room, your app server needs to generate a room token and send it to the app client. When an app client joins a room, Agora's server uses the room token for authentication.

To generate a room token on your app server, you can:

- Use code. See [Generate a Token from your app server](../develop/generate-token-app-server). (Recommended)
- Call the <Vg k="WHITE" /> RESTful API. See [Generate a Room Token (POST)](../develop/generate-token-rest#generate-a-room-token-post).

You can use the following Node.js script as a request example:
```javascript
var request = require('request');
var options = {
  "method": "POST",
   // Replace <Room UUID> with the uuid of your room
  "url": "https://api.netless.link/v5/tokens/rooms/<Room UUID>",
  "headers": {
  "token": "Your SDK Token",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "region": "us-sv"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({"lifespan":3600000,"role":"admin"})

};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

If the request is successful, Agora's server returns a room token. The following is a response example:

```javascript
"NETLESSROOM_YWs9XXXXXXXXXXXZWNhNjk" // Room Token
```

## Join the <Vg k="WHITE" /> room from your app client

This section shows how to integrate the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" /> into your application and call the methods provided by the SDK to join the existing <Vg k="WHITE" /> room.

1. Import the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" />.
In `index.html`, add `<script src="https://sdk.netless.link/white-web-sdk/2.15.16.js"></script>` right below the `<head>` line to import the <Vg k="WHITE_SDK" />.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
         <script src="https://sdk.netless.link/white-web-sdk/2.15.16.js"></script>
         <script src="./joinWhiteboard.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
         <div id="whiteboard" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh;"></div>
    </body>
    </html>
   ```

2. Create a `WhiteWebSdk` instance and join the room. You need to pass in the following parameters:
 - `appIdentifier`: The App Identifier of the whiteboard project in <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. See [Get security credentials for your <Vg k="WHITE" /> project](../develop/enable-whiteboard#get-security-credentials-for-your-whiteboard-project).
 - `region`: The data center, which must be the same as the data center you chose when creating the room.

   Open `joinWhiteboard.js` and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   var whiteWebSdk = new WhiteWebSdk({
     // Pass in your App Identifier.
     appIdentifier: "Your App Identifier",
	 // Set the data center as Silicon Valley, US.
	 region: "us-sv",
   })

   var joinRoomParams = {
     uuid: "Your room UUID",
	 // The unique identifier of a user. If you use versions earlier than v2.15.0, do not add this line.
	 uid: "user uid",
     roomToken: "Your room token",
   };

   // Join the whiteboard room and display the whiteboard on the web page.
   whiteWebSdk.joinRoom(joinRoomParams).then(function(room) {
       room.bindHtmlElement(document.getElementById("whiteboard"));
   }).catch(function(err) {
       console.error(err);
   });
   ```

## Test your app

Open `index.html` in your browser. You should see a blank page. If the application runs successfully, you can use your mouse to write and draw on the page.
