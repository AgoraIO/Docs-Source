#### Default audio routing

The routing employed by the device itself, such as the speakers on a mobile device, is called the default audio routing of that device.

The SDK uses the following default audio routing in different use-cases:

- **Voice call**: Earpiece
- **Video call**: Speaker
- **Live voice call**: Speaker
- **Live video streaming**: Speaker
