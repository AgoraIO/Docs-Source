This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic <Vpd k="NAME"/> app using the <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vpd k="SDK"/>.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow you implement to integrate <Vpd k="NAME" /> into your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

{/*
Where: 

- **<Vg k="ASDK"/>**: An SDK developed by <Vg k="COMPANY"/> to enable developers to add real-time audio interaction to their projects.
- **Channel**: A channel is used to transmit data. Users in the same channel can interact in real time.
- **Host**: A host can publish audio in a channel. The host can also subscribe to audio published by other hosts.
- **Audience**: A user assigned the audience role may subscribe to audio within the channel. However, they are not authorized to publish content.

For more information, see [Core Concepts](../overview/core-concepts).
*/}

To start a session, you implement the following steps in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

- **Retrieve a token**: A token is a computer-generated string that authenticates a user when your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> joins a channel. In this guide, you retrieve your token from <Vg k="CONSOLE" />. To see how to create an authentication server for development purposes, see [Secure authentication with tokens](../get-started/authentication-workflow). 

- **Join a channel**: Call methods to create and join a channel; <Vpl k="CLIENT" />s that pass the same channel name join the same channel.

- **Send and receive audio**: All users can send to and receive audio streams from other users in the channel.

## Prerequisites
<Prerequisites />
- The following information from [<Vg k="CONSOLE"/>](https://console.agora.io/v2):
    - **App ID**: A unique string generated by Agora that identifies your project.
    - **A temporary token**: A dynamic key that authenticates a user when the client joins a channel. Note down the channel name you use to generate the token.
        
        <Admonition type="info" title="information">The maximum validity period of a temporary token is 24 hours.</Admonition>
    
    Please refer to [Agora account management](../get-started/manage-agora-account) for details.
