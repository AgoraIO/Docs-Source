Emojis are widely used in real-time chats because they allow users to express their feelings in a direct and vivid way. In Agora Chat, "reactions" allow users to quickly react to a message using emojis in one-to-one chats and chat groups. In group chats, reactions can also be used to cast a vote, for example, by calculating the number of different emojis attached to the message. 

The following illustration shows the implementation of adding a reaction to a message, how a conversation looks with reactions, and what retrieving a list of reactions (with related information) looks like.

This page shows how to use the Chat SDK to implement reactions in your project.

## Understand the tech

The SDK provides the following APIs to implement reaction functionalities:

<Understand />

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- The project integrates a version of the Chat SDK later than v1.0.3 and has implemented the <Link to="../get-started/get-started-sdk">basic real-time chat functionalities</Link>.
- You understand the API call frequency limit as described in [Limitations](../reference/limitations).

<div class="alert info">The reaction feature is supported by all types of [Pricing Plans](../reference/pricing-plan-details) and is enabled by default once you have enabled Chat in <a href="https://console.agora.io/">Agora Console</a>.</div>

## Implementation

This section introduces how to implement reaction functionalities in your project.

## Next steps

Reactions are also supported in the [Chat Starter Kit](../get-started/get-started-uikit), which contains a wider range of emojis. You can also use the Starter Kit to implement reactions in your project.
