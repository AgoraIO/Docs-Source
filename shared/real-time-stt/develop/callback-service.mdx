Agora provides the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> service (<Vg k="NCS" />), which sends notifications about <Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME" /> events. You can set up an HTTPS server to receive these notifications. When an event occurs, the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service notifies the <Vg k="NCS_LONG" /> service, which then sends an HTTPS request to your server.

## Callback information

After you enable <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/>, when a specified event occurs, the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> server sends an HTTP/HTTPS request as a callback. The request body provides the main information of the callback in a JSON object. The JSON object contains different fields for different events.

The structure of the message notification callback in version 7.x differs from that in versions 5.x and 6.x. Refer to the relevant section based on your implementation.

## v7.x

This section explains the structure of the message notification callback for version 7.x.

### Request body

The message notification callback request body includes the following fields:

| Field       | Type        | Description       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `sid`       | String      | The agent ID.     |
| `noticeId`  | String      | The notification ID. Uniquely identifies an event notification from the Agora service.      |
| `productId` | Number      | The service ID. `20` indicates speech-to-text service.         |
| `eventType` | Number      | The type of event. See [Event types](#event-types) for details. |
| `notifyMs`  | Number      | The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the Agora messaging server sends the notification.       |
| `payload`   | JSON object | Event-specific data. The structure of `payload` depends on the `eventType`. For details, see [Event types](#event-types). |

**Example**:

```json
{
    "sid": "agent_id",
    "noticeId": "e94f5b6fd69446ea9d75da90a59ca8a2",
    "productId": 20,
    "eventType": 101,
    "notifyMs": 1750235972193,
    "payload": {...}
}
```

### Event types

The Agora message notification service supports the following events for the speech-to-text service:

| `eventType` | `event_name`   | Description        |
| ----------- | -------------- | --- |
| `101`       | `agent joined` | The agent joins the channel. |
| `102`       | `agent left`   | The agent leaves the channel.   |

#### Event 101: Agent joined

The `eventType` value `101` indicates that an agent has joined a channel. The `payload` contains the following fields:

| Field      | Type     | Description            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `agent_id` | `String` | The task ID associated with the agent.  |
| `start_ts` | `Number` | The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the task started. |
| `channel`  | `String` | The name of the channel the agent joined.              |

**Example**:

```json
{
    "agent_id": "agent_id",
    "channel": "stt_ncs93369",
    "start_ts": 1750235971
}
```

#### Event 102: Agent left

The `eventType` value `102` indicates that an agent left the channel. The `payload` includes the following fields:

| Field      | Type     | Description  |
| ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| `agent_id` | `String` | The task ID associated with the agent.       |
| `start_ts` | `Number` | The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the task started.        |
| `stop_ts`  | `Number` | The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the task ended.          |
| `channel`  | `String` | The name of the channel the agent was in.    |
| `status`   | `String` | The status of the task:<br/>= `STOPPED`: The task ended normally or due to idle timeout.<br/>- `FAILED`: The task failed.       |
| `message`  | `String` | The reason the agent exited the channel:<br/>- `OK`: The agent exited normally.<br/>- `Idle for too long`: The task timed out due to inactivity.<br/>- `RTC connection error`: The agent exited due to a connection error.<br/>- `Fatal ASR error`: The task exited because of an ASR module error.<br/>- `Fatal Translation error`: The task exited due to a translation module error. |

## v5.x and v6.x

This section explains the structure of the message notification callback for SDK versions 5.x and 6.x.

- The following [Payload fields](#payload-fields) are common for all <Vpd k="NAME"/> events.
- The values of `eventType`, `serviceType`, and `details` depend on the event.

- `cname`: String. The name of the channel to be transcribed.
- `subBotUid`: String. The UID of the bot subscribing to the audio.
- `pubBotUid`: String. The UID of the bot publishing the text to the channel.
- `taskId`: String. The ID of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> task.
- `sequence`: Number. The serial number of the notification, starting from `0`. You can use this parameter to identify notifications that are random, lost, or re-sent.
- `serviceScene`: String, the current service scene.
    - `1`: <Vpd k="NAME"/> service.
- `sendts`: Number. The time (UTC) when the event happens. Unix timestamp in ms.

```


<Admonition type="caution" title="Best Practice">
Agora does not recommended that core applications rely heavily on <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/>. If your application currently depends heavily on NCS, contact support@agora.io to enable the redundant message notification function. This feature doubles the number of received notifications, thereby reducing the probability of message loss. However, after enabling this function, you must check the message SID to manage duplicate messages. Please note that message notifications still cannot guarantee a 100% arrival rate.
</Admonition>


## Reference

This section contains content that completes the information on this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

### What are the differences between the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service and the query method?

You can monitor the status of the <Vpd k="NAME"/> service either through the `query` method or by the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service, to take action when required. Both options have pros and cons.

#### The `query` method

You can periodically call the `query` method to monitor the status of <Vpd k="NAME"/>.

- Pros: Reliable, as the status is queried proactively.
- Cons:
    - Provides limited status information.
    - Requires an active query. You cannot query too often because of the Queries Per Second (QPS) limit, and thus it is not as real-time as the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service.

If the status reliability of <Vpd k="NAME"/> is a high priority, Agora strongly recommends using the `query` method.

#### <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service

You can use the <Vg k="NCS_LONG"/> service as a complementary option to monitor the service status. You need to configure an HTTP/HTTPS server to receive event notifications.

- Pros: Real-time
- Cons:
    - The server passively receives messages, and the messages may get lost.
    - The confirmation message of the message delivery may get lost, causing the message to be re-sent. In such a case, you need to deduplicate the notifications.
- The messages may not arrive in the correct order.
