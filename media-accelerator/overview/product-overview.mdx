Media Accelerator (MA) helps developers implement real-time audio and video stream transmission and intercommunication for IoT scenarios and devices.

Based on the real-time transmission of the SD-RTN™ (Software Defined Real-time Network), MA makes use of global network nodes, intelligent dynamic routing, and end-side poor network countermeasure algorithms to provide reliable video and audio stream transmission cloud services. Agora's technology provides high connectivity, low latency, and maximum stability while reducing the impact of network problems such as delay and packet loss on the quality and experience of audio and video transmission.
