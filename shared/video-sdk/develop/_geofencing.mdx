When a user joins a channel, <Vpd k="SDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. Agora geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for geofencing:

![Network Geofencing](/images/common/geofencing.png)

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) project.

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />, open the [<Vg k="GET_STARTED"/>](../get-started/get-started-sdk) <Vpd k="NAME"/> project you created previously.

## Implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vpd k="SDK" /> to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

1. [Generate a temporary token](../reference/manage-agora-account#generate-a-temporary-token) in <Vg k="CONSOLE" /> .

2. In your browser, navigate to the <Link target="_blank" to="{{Global.DEMO_BASIC_VIDEO_CALL_URL}}"><Vg k="COMPANY" /> web demo</Link> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click **Join**.

## Reference

This section contains information that completes the information in this page, or points you to documentation that explains other aspects to this product.

- When the user's location is different from the specified region, the public network spanning between the user's location and the specified region might have a poor quality, which can make the audio and video experience less than optimal.
- To specify multiple regions for the connection, you can perform bitwise operations on the area codes. To include a region, use the `|` operator, to exclude a region  use `^`.
