This page explains how Agora calculates your monthly bill for use of <Vpd k="NAME" />. If you have signed a contract with Agora, the billing terms and conditions within that contract take precedence.

## Cost structure
<Vg k="COMPANY" /> <Vpd k="NAME" /> usage incurs fees when transcoding and streaming media streams to <Vg k="VSDK" /> channels. The related fees are not included in the 10,000 free minutes per month policy.

<Vg k="COMPANY" /> charges fees depending on whether or not the media stream is transcoded before streaming.

### Streaming without transcoding

If the video stream is not transcoded before streaming, only the audio and video streaming fee is charged. 

*Video streaming fee (without transcoding) = Video streaming unit price (without transcoding) × Video streaming duration*

### Streaming with transcoding

- **Pure audio transcoding and streaming**: Audio streams require transcoding, which incurs both transcoding and streaming charges. The total cost is calculated as: 
    
    *Audio transcoding and streaming fees = audio unit price × duration*

- **Video transcoding and streaming**: If the video stream is transcoded and streamed, video transcoding fees is incurred. The total cost is calculated as: 
    
    *Video transcoding and streaming fees = video transcoding and streaming unit price × duration*

<Admonition type="info">
The audio stream in the channel is transcoded and pushed by default.
If a channel has both audio and video streams, the fee is calculated based on the video stream.
</Admonition>

### Unit price

The unit price for streaming with and without transcoding is as follows:

|Usage                                 | Unit price (US$) |
|:--------------------------------------|------------------:|
| Pure audio transcoding and streaming | 0.99/1000 min   |
| Video streaming with transcoding     | 5.99/1000 min   |
| Video streaming without transcoding  | 2.99/1000 min   |

### Streaming duration

For each streaming process, <Vg k="COMPANY" /> monitors when you start and stop streaming. It calculates the duration (in seconds) from the moment streaming begins to when it ends and charges a streaming fee based on that time.

<Admonition type="info">
The duration is displayed in seconds in the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> console and in minutes on the billing invoice. If the duration is less than one second or one minute, it is rounded up to one second or one minute, respectively.
</Admonition>

Depending on whether the video stream is pushed or not, the push duration is divided into the following categories:

- **Video streaming duration**: The duration during which the streaming server handles video. If there are both audio and video streams, the duration is calculated based on the video stream.
- **Audio streaming duration**: The time during which only the audio stream is transmitted by the streaming server.

## Billing examples

Consider the following use-cases to understand the pricing structure:

### Video streaming
Suppose that you use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service to push a video stream that does not require transcoding in a channel, and the push duration is 3000 minutes.

The cost of video streaming (without transcoding) = the unit price of video streaming (without transcoding) × the duration of video streaming = $2.99/thousand minutes × 3000 minutes = $8.97

### Pure audio transcoding and streaming
Suppose that you use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service to push a pure audio stream in a channel (transcoded by default), and the push duration is 2000 minutes.

The pure audio transcoding and streaming cost = audio transcoding and streaming unit price × audio transcoding and streaming duration = $0.99/thousand minutes × 2000 minutes = $1.98

### Video transcoding and streaming
Suppose that you use the <Vpd k="NAME" /> service to push a video stream with transcoding in a channel. The transcoded stream duration is 2000 minutes and the video resolution is 1920 × 1080.

The cost of video transcoding and streaming = unit price of video transcoding and streaming × duration of video transcoding and streaming = $5.99/thousand minutes × 2000 minutes = $11.98
