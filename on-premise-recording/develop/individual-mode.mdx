import Implementation from '@docs/shared/on-premise-recording/develop/individual-recording/index.mdx';

The On-Premise Recording SDK supports two recording modes:

- Individual recording mode: This is the default recording mode. The SDK generates one audio and/or video file for each UID.
- Composite recording mode: Generates a single mixed audio and video file for all UIDs in a channel, or mixes the audio of all UIDs in the channel into an audio file and the video of all UIDs into a video file.

See [Differences between individual recording mode and composite recording mode](https://docs.agora.io/en/help/integration-issues/recording_mode) to decide which mode you should use.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, follow the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/quickstart) guide to integrate the Recording SDK and implement the basic recording functionality.

## Implement individual recording

The implementation of individual recording is largely similar to the steps in the [Quickstart](/on-premise-recording/get-started/quickstart) guide. The main differences are in the configuration parameters and the APIs used.


Refer to the following call sequence diagram to understand the recording workflow.

### Considerations

The individual recording mode supports a specific set of APIs. Calling unsupported methods in the wrong mode has no effect. When using the individual recording recording mode, the following methods do not work:

  * [`setRecorderConfig`](/on-premise-recording/reference/api-reference#setrecorderconfig)
  * [`enableAndUpdateVideoWatermarks`](/on-premise-recording/reference/api-reference#enableandupdatevideowatermarks)
  * [`setVideoMixingLayout`](/on-premise-recording/reference/api-reference#setvideomixinglayout)
  * [`startRecording`](/on-premise-recording/reference/api-reference#startrecording)
  * [`stopRecording`](/on-premise-recording/reference/api-reference#stoprecording)
