<Vpd k="SDK" /> makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some cases, users want to modify the captured audio to add voice effects, or change the voice quality before the audio is published. <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides several options that enable you to apply voice effects. This page shows you how to implement these features in your channel.

## Understand the tech

Voice effects are gaining popularity in social interaction and entertainment use-cases. To help you quickly integrate voice effects into your project, <Vpd k="SDK" /> provides pre-configured effects. Choose from the following effects:

* **Voice beautifiers**
    * Voice beautifier for Chat: Beautify the voice in chat use-cases according to the characteristics of male and female voices without changing the original voice recognition.
    * Singing beautifier: Beautify the singing voice according to male and female voice characteristics while retaining the original character of the singing voice.
    * Timbre shift: Fine-tune the timbre of a vocal in a specific direction.

* **Sound effects**
    * Style sound effects: For songs of a specific style, make the singing and accompaniment more compatible.
    * Spatial shaping: Create a spatial atmosphere through spatial reverberation effects. Make the vocals seem to come from a specific source.
    * Electronic sound effects: Adjust the pitch of the vocals to perfectly match the key and pitch of the accompaniment for an electronic sound effect.

* **Voice changer**
    * Basic voice changing: Make the voice more neutral, sweet, or stable while retain a certain degree of voice recognition.
    * Advanced voice changing: Dramatically change the human voice to realize voices of uncle, girl, Hulk, etc.

* **Custom audio effects** 
    If the preset effects don't meet your needs, manually adjust the voice pitch, equalization, and reverberation to achieve a customized effect.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the code examples on this page, make sure you have completed the [SDK quickstart](../../video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) guide.

## Implement voice effects

This section shows how to use different sound beautifiers to enhance your audio experience. 

Use the following methods to set the desired vocal effects:

<PlatformWrapper notAllowed="unity">

*  Call the `setVoiceBeautifierPreset` method to apply effects such as chatting bel canto, singing bel canto, and timbre change.
*  Utilize the `setAudioEffectPreset` method to configure sound effects, genre sound effects, space shaping, and other effects.
*  Apply the `setVoiceConversionPreset` method to entirely transform the original voice.
If the preset effects don't meet your requirements, customize vocal effects using methods such as `setLocalVoicePitch`, `setLocalVoiceEqualization`, and `setLocalVoiceReverb`.
