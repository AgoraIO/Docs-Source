2.  In **preload.js**, update `appID`, `channel` and `token` with your values.

3.  Run the app
    
    Execute the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    You see your app opens a window named **Get started with <Vpd k="PRODUCT" />**.

6. Select a user role. Press **Join** to connect to the same channel as your web demo.

7. **Test volume control**

    a. Speak into your development device as you move the **Local Audio Volume** range slider to the left and then right. You notice the volume decrease and then increase in the web demo app as the recording volume changes.

    b. Tap **Mute** while you speak into the microphone connected to the web demo app.
        You notice that the remote audio is muted on your development device.

    c. To test other volume control methods, in `preload.js`, replace `agoraEngine.adjustRecordingSignalVolume(parseInt(evt.target.value));` with one of the following:

        ```javascript
        agoraEngine.adjustPlaybackSignalVolume(parseInt(evt.target.value));
        agoraEngine.adjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(remoteUid,parseInt(evt.target.value));
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingVolume(parseInt(evt.target.value));
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume(parseInt(evt.target.value));
        agoraEngine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume(parseInt(evt.target.value));
        ```
        Run the app again and use the volume slider to test the change in the corresponding volume setting.

    d. To test other mute methods, locate the `document.getElementById("mute").onclick` event listener and replace the `muteRemoteAudioStream` call with one of the following:

        ```javascript
        agoraEngine.muteAllRemoteAudioStreams(isMuted);
        agoraEngine.muteLocalAudioStream(isMuted);
        ```
        Run the app again and tap **Mute** to test the effect of these mute methods.

6. **Test Screen sharing**

    a. Press **Share Screen**. You see your device screen shared in the web demo app alongside your camera stream.

    b. Press **Stop Sharing**. Screen sharing is stopped.
