Tokens are essential for authenticating users and ensuring secure communication between clients and servers in real-time applications. By deploying a token server, you can centralize token generation and management, making it easier to scale and maintain your application. This guide assists in deploying a Go-based token server on a local machine. When a client sends a request, the locally deployed token server generates and sends the corresponding token back to the client. 

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your local machine. You can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).
- Basic knowledge of Go programming.

## Implement a Go token server

This section demonstrates how to run a token server on your local device, enabling you to generate and distribute tokens.
