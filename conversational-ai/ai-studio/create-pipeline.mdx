   Create and configure your first agent pipeline in Convo AI Studio
---

This guide walks you through creating your first agent pipeline in <Vpd k="STUDIO" />. You'll create a pipeline, configure ASR, LLM, and TTS providers, and test your configuration before deployment.

## Prerequisites

To create a pipeline in <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, you need:

- An active Agora account
- An Agora project with [Conversational AI enabled](/conversational-ai/get-started/manage-agora-account#enable-conversational-ai)
- API credentials for supported LLM, ASR, and TTS providers

## Access Convo AI Studio

To open <Vpd k="STUDIO" />:

1. Log in to [<Vg k="CONSOLE" />](https://console.agora.io/).
2. From the left sidebar, select **<Vpd k="STUDIO" />**.

## Create a pipeline

You can create a pipeline from scratch or start from a template. This section shows you how to create a pipeline from scratch and configure each component.

### Create a new pipeline

1. Select **Agent Pipelines** from the left sidebar.
2. Click the **New Pipeline** button.
3. Select **<Vpd k="AGENT" />** as the pipeline type.
4. Enter a name for your pipeline.
5. Select an Agora project from the dropdown or create a new project.
6. Click **Create**.

After creating your pipeline, you're taken to the pipeline editor where you can configure your agent's ASR, LLM, and TTS components.

### Configure ASR 

The ASR component converts spoken audio into text for the LLM to process.

1. Click on the **ASR** component in the sidebar or the pipeline editor.

2. In the **Configure ASR** panel, select your ASR vendor from the dropdown.
3. Click the **Credential** dropdown.
4. Select **Create New Credential**.

5. Enter a descriptive name for your credential.
6. Paste your ASR provider API key.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Ensure the credential you created is selected in the ASR configuration panel.
9. Configure additional ASR parameters in the sidebar as needed. Available parameters vary by vendor. For parameter descriptions, navigate to your vendor's page from the [ASR overview](/conversational-ai/models/asr/overview).

### Configure LLM 

The LLM processes user input and generates appropriate responses based on your configuration.

1. Click on the **LLM** component in the pipeline editor.
2. Select your LLM vendor from the dropdown.
3. Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **Create New Credential**.
4. Enter a descriptive name for your credential.
5. Paste your LLM provider API key.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Ensure the credential you created is selected in the LLM configuration panel.
8. In the **System Messages** field, enter a system prompt that defines your agent's behavior. For example: `You are a helpful customer support assistant.`
9. In the **Greeting Message** field, enter the message your agent will use to greet users. For example: `Hello! How can I help you today?`
10. Configure additional LLM parameters in the sidebar as needed. Available parameters vary by vendor. For parameter descriptions, navigate to your vendor's page from the [LLM overview](/conversational-ai/models/llm/overview).

### Configure TTS 

The TTS component converts the LLM's text responses into natural-sounding speech.

1. Click on the **TTS** component in the pipeline editor.
    ![TTS configuration](/images/conversational-ai/studio/pipeline-tts-config.png)
2. In the **Configure TTS** panel, select your TTS vendor from the dropdown.
3. Click the **Credential** dropdown.
4. Click **Create New Credential**.
5. Enter a descriptive name for your credential.
6. Paste your TTS provider API key.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Ensure the credential you created is selected in the TTS configuration panel.
9. Configure additional TTS parameters in the sidebar as needed. Available parameters vary by vendor. For parameter descriptions, navigate to your vendor's page from the [TTS overview](/conversational-ai/models/tts/overview).

## Create from template

Instead of configuring a pipeline from scratch, you can start from a pre-built template:

1. In <Vpd k="STUDIO" />, click **Templates** in the sidebar menu.
1. Select a template from the available options that most closely matches your use case and click **Create Agent**. This creates an agent pipeline from the template.
1. Enter a name for your pipeline.
1. Select an Agora project from the dropdown.
1. Click **Create**.

Templates come with pre-configured LLM system and greeting messages with variables that you can use for [telephony campaigns](/conversational-ai/ai-studio/telephony/campaign). You can customize the pipeline by clicking on each component in the pipeline editor and updating the configuration as needed. After customizing, save your pipeline and use the **Test Agent** button to verify your changes.
