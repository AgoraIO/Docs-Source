### Mute and unmute users

To mute or unmute the local audio stream, call `MuteLocalAudioStream`:

```csharp
// Stop publishing the local audio stream
RtcEngine.MuteLocalAudioStream(true);

// Resume publishing the local audio stream
RtcEngine.MuteLocalAudioStream(false);
``` 

To mute or unmute a remote user, call `MuteRemoteAudioStream` with the `uid` of the remote user:

```csharp
// Stop subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
RtcEngine.MuteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, true);

// Resume subscribing to the audio stream of the remote user
RtcEngine.MuteRemoteAudioStream(remoteUid, false);
```

<Admonition type="info">
To mute remote users without unsubscribing, set their [playback volume](#adjust-the-playback-volume) to `0`.
</Admonition>

### Adjust the playback volume
Call `AdjustPlaybackSignalVolume` or `AdjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio playback signal.

```csharp
// Set the volume for all remote users' playback locally to 50
RtcEngine.AdjustPlaybackSignalVolume(50);

// Set the playback volume for the remote user with the uid of 12 locally to 50
RtcEngine.AdjustUserPlaybackSignalVolume(12, 50);
```

### Adjust the recording volume
Call `AdjustRecordingSignalVolume` to adjust the volume of the audio recording signal.

```csharp
// Adjust the recording signal volume to 50
RtcEngine.AdjustRecordingSignalVolume(50);
```

When configuring audio settings, it's essential to understand the default behavior and the options available. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* The SDK defaults to a device volume of `85` when using the recording device to capture audio signals.
* A volume of `0` means mute, and a volume of `255` represents the maximum volume of the device.
* If the SDK detects that the recording volume is too low in the current environment, it automatically increases the volume of the recording device.
* The volume of the recording device directly influences the global volume of the device.
* If the default recording device volume does not meet your requirements, adjust it by regulating the signal amplitude captured by the microphone or sound card.

### Get volume information of users
<Vpd k="SDK"/> enables you to obtain the user IDs and corresponding volumes of the three users with the highest instantaneous volumes in a channel during the process of audio recording, mixing, and playback.  You use the `OnAudioVolumeIndication` callback to obtain this information. A returned `uid` of `0` in the callback indicates the local user.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note" style="background-color:yellow">Call `EnableAudioVolumeIndication` to enable reporting of the users' volume in the callback.</Admonition>

```csharp
RtcEngine = Agora.Rtc.RtcEngine.CreateAgoraRtcEngine();
UserEventHandler handler = new UserEventHandler(this);
RtcEngineContext context = new RtcEngineContext(
    _appID, 
    0,
    CHANNEL_PROFILE_TYPE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING,
    AUDIO_SCENARIO_TYPE.AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT
);
RtcEngine.Initialize(context);

// Set up listener callback
RtcEngine.InitEventHandler(handler);

// Enable volume indication
RtcEngine.EnableAudioVolumeIndication(1, 1, true);

class UserEventHandler : IRtcEngineEventHandler
{
    // This callback is triggered at the interval set in EnableAudioVolumeIndication and reports the three users with the highest instant volume in the channel
    public override void OnAudioVolumeIndication(
        RtcConnection connection, 
        AudioVolumeInfo[] speakers, 
        uint speakerNumber, 
        int totalVolume
    ) { }
}
```
