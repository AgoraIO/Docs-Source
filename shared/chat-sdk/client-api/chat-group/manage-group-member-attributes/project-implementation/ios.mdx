### Set custom attributes of a group member via key and value items

Each chat group member can set their own attributes. Chat group admins/owners can also modify all members' attributes. Each custom attribute should be in key-value format.

Refer to the following sample code to set a custom attribute of a group member:

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.groupManager setMemberAttribute:@"groupId" userId:@"userId" attributes:@{@"key":@"value"} completion:^(AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

    }];
```

### Fetch group member custom attributes

Chat group members and group admins/owners can retrieve custom attributes of multiple group members by attribute key.

Refer to the following sample code to use the attribute key to fetch custom attributes of multiple group members:

```objc
[AgoraChatClient.sharedClient.groupManager fetchMembersAttributes:@"groupId" userIds:@[@"userId1",@"userId2"] keys:@[@"key1",@"key2"] completion:^(NSDictionary<NSString *,NSDictionary<NSString *,NSString *> *> * _Nullable attributes, AgoraChatError * _Nullable error) {

}];
```


### Listen for attribute changes of a group member

`AgoraChatGroupManagerDelegate` class holds callbacks that can be used to monitor the change of any key-value items. When such a change occurs, an `onAttributesChangedOfGroupMember` callback will notify the Client SDK by returning chat group ID, UID, and key-value pairs of the changes.

```objc
- (void)onAttributesChangedOfGroupMember:(NSString *)groupId userId:(NSString *)userId attributes:(NSDictionary<NSString *,NSString *> *)attributes operatorId:(NSString *)operatorId {
}
```
