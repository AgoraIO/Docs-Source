This section guides you through working with TEN apps in the <Vpd k="DESIGNER" />.

### Load an existing app

To load an existing app, use the **Load App** button in the **App** menu. You see the following interface:

![Loading an Existing TEN app](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_load_app.png)

Use the file browser to select the app's root directory. <Vpd k="DESIGNER" /> automatically loads the app.

### Manage loaded apps

To manage loaded TEN apps, click the **Manage Loaded App(s)** button in the **App** menu. You see the following **Apps Manager** interface:

![Managing Loaded TEN apps](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_manage_loaded_apps.png)

Use the Apps Manager dialog to perform various operations on your loaded applications:

- Unload loaded apps
- Reload specified apps
- Reload all loaded apps
- Install dependencies for specified apps
- Execute predefined scripts for specific apps

### Install app dependencies

To install all dependencies for your app using the **Apps Manager**:

1. Open the **Apps Manager** interface in TEN Designer
2. Click **Install All** for your target application
3. Monitor the installation progress in the interface shown below:

![Installing All Dependencies for an App](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_install_all.png)

The app's `manifest.json` file defines these dependencies. Following is an example of a `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "type": "app",
  "name": "aaa",
  "version": "0.8.18",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime",
      "version": "0.8.18"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_muxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_demuxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_client",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "protocol",
      "name": "msgpack",
      "version": "^0.8.18"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python3 tools/run_script.py start",
    "build": "python3 tools/run_script.py build"
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies the following TEN package dependencies:

- `ten_runtime`: The system package of TEN Framework
- `ffmpeg_demuxer`: A TEN Extension package for decoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_muxer`: A TEN Extension package for encoding audio and video
- `ffmpeg_client`: A TEN Extension package for processing audio and video using the other two ffmpeg extension packages
- `msgpack`: A TEN Protocol package for message serialization and deserialization using the MessagePack protocol

After installing the dependencies, <Vpd k="MANAGER" /> organizes the packages in the following directory structure:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_client
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_demuxer
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_muxer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protocol
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ msgpack
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_runtime
```

Note that the `ffmpeg` system package appears even though it's not listed in `manifest.json`. <Vpd k="MANAGER" /> automatically detects and installs transitive dependencies when `ffmpeg_demuxer` and `ffmpeg_muxer` require the `ffmpeg` package.

### Install TEN extensions 

To install extensions from the TEN Cloud Store:

1. Click **Open Extension Store** in the **Extensions** menu
2. Search for the required extension in the store interface
3. Click **Install** to add the extension to your current app

After installation, the new extension appears in your current TEN app and is available for use in your graphs.

![TEN Cloud Store](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_store.png)


### Run a TEN app

Use the **Apps Manager** to execute preset runtime operations on the selected app. Click the **Run** button in the **Apps Manager** to open the following interface:

![Run a TEN app](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_run.png)

In the dialog, select the preset operation to execute from the dropdown menu. The menu typically includes the following operations:

- **Run App**: Start the app and display output in the TEN Designer message window
- **Build App**: Compile the app, if required. Since TEN Framework supports multiple programming languages, compilation requirements vary by language. For example, C++ apps require compilation, while Python apps run directly without a build step.

Following is the build interface for a TEN app developed in C++:

![Building a TEN app](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_build.png)

After the build is complete, continue with the startup operation. The system displays a window showing the TEN app's runtime logs in real-time:

![Starting a TEN app](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_app_start.png)

## Working with TEN graphs

TEN graphs define how extensions connect and communicate within your application, providing a visual representation of your app's data flow and processing pipeline.

### Load an existing graph

To load an existing TEN graph, click the **Load Graph** option in the **Graph** menu. After the graph loads, you see an interface similar to the following:

![TEN Graph](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_graph_overview.png)

This sample graph contains three TEN extensions:

- **ffmpeg_demuxer**: Decodes audio and video
- **ffmpeg_muxer**: Encodes audio and video  
- **ffmpeg_client**: Processes audio and video

Each TEN extension has defined inputs and outputs. For example, the `ffmpeg_demuxer` extension includes:

- 2 command inputs
- 1 command output
- 1 audio frame output
- 1 video frame output

Click the numbered input or output buttons on any extension to open a connection management dialog:

![TEN Message Input/Output Dialog](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_msg_info_dialog.png)

Use this dialog to view and manage connections between extensions in your graph.

### Organize graph layout

You can organize your graph layout as follows:

1. **Manual positioning**: Drag extensions to desired locations
2. **Automatic layout**: Click **Auto Layout** in the **Graph** menu to automatically arrange all extensions

The auto-layout feature is particularly helpful when your graph becomes cluttered or after adding multiple new extensions.

### Access extension files and tools

Right-click any extension in the graph to open its context menu:

![TEN Extension Context Menu](/images/ten-framework/ten_designer_extension_context_menu.png)

The context menu provides quick access to extension files and tools:

- **Edit manifest.json**: Edit the extension's configuration and API definitions
- **Edit property.json**: Modify the extension's runtime properties  
- **Launch terminal**: Launch a terminal in the extension's root directory
- **View logs**: Display the extension's runtime logs and debug information
- **Delete**: Remove the extension from the current graph
