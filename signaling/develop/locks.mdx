Critical resources can only be used by one process at a time. If a critical resource is shared between different processes, each process needs to be mutually exclusive to prevent interference with each other. Signaling provides a complete set of Lock solutions. By controlling different processes in the distributed system, you can solve the competition problem when users access shared resources.
