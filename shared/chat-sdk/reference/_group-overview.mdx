<Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>s are features that enable instant messaging among multiple chat users. The relationship between <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> members is persistent: <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> members can send and receive messages in the group and also receive push messages when they are offline.

## <Vg k="CHAT"/> group types

Groups can be divided into public groups and private groups according to the public accessibility.

| Group type | Join method  | Retrieval of group information       |
| :------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Public group   | Any users can apply to join a group or be invited by the group owner or an admin to join. Whether the join requests need to be approved by the group owner or admins depends on the group setting, for example, `GroupStyle` for Android.  | <ul><li>The specifications of a group and the list of public groups are accessible to the public. </li><li>The group announcement, the list of group shared files, and the group member list are only accessible to users that have joined the group.</li></ul>|
| Private group   | Users can only be invited to join a group. Whether regular group members, besides the group owner and admins, can invite a user to join the group depends on the group setting, for example, `GroupStyle` for Android.| The group specifications, group announcement, the list of group shared files, and the group member list are only accessible to users that have joined the group.  |

The offline push function is not available to group with more than 3000 members. To enable the offline push function for such a large group, contact [support@agoro.io](mailto:support@agoro.io) before creating it. Note that it is impossible to enable the offline push function for a large group that is created. The maximum number of members that a group can contain varies with your price plans. For details, see [Pricing Plan Details](pricing-plan-details).

## <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> roles and privileges

<Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>s have the following roles and privileges:

- <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> members: Members can send and receive group messages. They do not have any administrative privileges.
- <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> admins: Admins are members that also have some administrative privileges, including modifying the group announcements and managing <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> members (but not other admins). Admins are appointed by the <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/> owner.
- <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> owner: The owner is the group member with the most authority. When a user creates a <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>, they automatically become the group owner. Owners have the most privileges in a <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>, including appointing group admins, modifying group announcements, and managing group members (including admins). Owners can also disband the group or transfer ownership to another member.

## <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>s vs. <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s

<Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>s and <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s both support instant messaging among multiple users. However, <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s typically have a more consistent membership then <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>s. <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/> users are normally connected to the group itself; <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> users are more likely to be connected by their interest in the subject of the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>, and so they tend to join and leave more freely.

The specific feature differences are listed in the following table:

| Feature    | <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP"/>   | <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/>     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where members have a preexisting relationship with each other. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream channel, they leave the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000+  |
| Message push support | Members receive push messages when they go offline. | Members do not receive push messages when they go offline. |
| Offline message storage   | This feature is supported. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="CHAT"/> servers store messages sent to offline group members and sends to them once they go back online. A maximum number of 200 messages across <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>s can be stored per end user.  | <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM"/> does not store messages sent to offline <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> members and this feature is not supported in <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>s. |
| Message history  | <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="CHAT"/> servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. You can call [this Client API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/client-api/messages/retrieve-messages?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages-of-the-specified-conversation) to allow the SDK to retrieve message history of a <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>. This allows end users to synchronize messages history across multiple end devices.  | <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="CHAT"/> servers store message history, subject to the [data retention period of your package selection](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/reference/pricing-plan-details?platform=android#message). The history can be retrieved by your app server via [this RESTful API](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/restful-api/message-management?platform=android#retrieve-historical-messages), in the format of JSON files. <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="CHAT"/> currently does not support SDK retrieving message history of a <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> via client APIs. However, when a user joins a <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/>, <Vg k="COMPANY"/> <Vg k="CHAT"/> servers can send 10 most recent messages to the client side via the message receiving callback. To enable this function, you need to contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io). The number of historical messages sent to the new <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> member can be increased up to 200, without additional charges.|
| Message reliability | Each member receives all the messages in the <Vg k="CHAT_GROUP_LOWER"/>. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the <Vg k="CHAT_ROOM_LOWER"/> message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |
