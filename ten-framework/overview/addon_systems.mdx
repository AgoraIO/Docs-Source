The TEN framework uses **addons** as its basic software modules. All functionality in the TEN framework is implemented through addons.

You can create the following types of addons:

- TEN extension addon
- TEN extension group addon
- TEN protocol addon

## Loading addons

To load an addon into the TEN runtime, you need:

1. **Addon name**
   
   Must be globally unique within the TEN app. Loading multiple addons with the same name causes undefined behavior and may prevent proper loading of the second addon.

2. **Addon folder location**
   
   The TEN runtime needs the addon's directory location to serve as its `base_dir`. From this directory, the runtime loads related files such as `manifest.json` and `property.json`.
   
   The addon register API attempts to detect this directory automatically. In cases where automatic detection fails, you must specify the folder location `base_dir` explicitly.

3. **Addon instance**

## Registering addons

You can register addons in the following ways:

1. **Use the explicit registration API**
   
   Call the API to register the addon's `base_dir` to the TEN runtime.

   Currently, only the standalone testing framework provides this API.

2. **Use the designated directory structure**
   
   Place addons in the `ten_packages/` directory of your TEN app. The app automatically loads these addons at startup when organized as follows:

   ```
   .
   └── ten_packages/
       ├── extension/
       │   ├── <extension_foo>/
       │   └── <extension_bar>/
       ├── extension_group/
       │   └── <extension_group_x>/
       └── protocol/
           └── <protocol_a>/
   ```
