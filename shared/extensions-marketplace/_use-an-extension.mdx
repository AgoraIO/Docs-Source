Extensions are add-ons designed to rapidly extend the functionality of your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. [Extensions Marketplace](https://www.agora.io/en/agora-extensions-marketplace/) is home to extensions that make your app more fun. Extensions provide features such as Audio effects and voice changing, Face filters and background removal, and Live transcription and captioning.

In the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Extensions Marketplace:
- Vendors create and publish extensions to provide functionality such as audio and video processing.
- App developers use extensions to quickly implement fun and interactive functionality.

This page shows you how to integrate an extension from <Vg k="COMPANY" /> Extensions Marketplace into your <Vpl
k="CLIENT" />. There can be specific guidance for each extension.

## Understand the tech

An extension accesses voice and video data when it is captured from the user's local device, modifies it, then plays the updated data to local and remote video channels.

![img](/images/video-sdk/extension-callflow.svg)

A typical transmission pipeline consists of a chain of procedures, including capture, pre-processing, encoding, transmitting, decoding, post-processing, and play. Audio or video extensions are inserted into either the pre-processing or post-processing procedure, in order to modify the voice or video data in the transmission pipeline.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have:
